Cowaramup man Paul Ian Marshall was sentenced earlier this year to four years imprisonment for indecent behaviour. Mr Grono said education was an important tool and parents needed to feel they could speak with their children freely, knowing people they can trust to confide in if something is wrong. He said paedophiles were capable of devious behaviour, befriending people and gaining their confidence, so education was helpful to both children and adults to enhance child protection.  http://www.margaretrivermail.com.au/news/local/news/general/keeping-local-children-safe/765458.aspx

Trevor Wayne Adams, 50, appeared in the District Court yesterday. He was found guilty, following a trial, of 11 child sex offences including unlawful sexual intercourse and inciting a child to commit an indecent act. The offences took place in Loxton between 2009 and 2010. The court had heard two of the victims received death threats and feared for their safety after turning the sexual predator in to police.

Offences occurred between 1999 - 2001..Prior convictions for child sex offences in 1984 and 1992. . News (9-2-2009)- A self-confessed pedophile has told a court he is "pained" that the family and young boy he befriended, then betrayed, would "likely not think kind thoughts" about him anymore. Peter Aeberhard today told the District Court he felt "a sense of loss" over the disintegration of his relationship with the family, for whom he had "genuine affection and love". Ben Sale, for Aeberhard, said his client was "not purely a predator". "This was not a relationship which can be seen as purely predatory  he developed an emotional attraction to the victim before the sexual attraction," he said. "There was a genuine and legitimate interaction that all members of the family appreciated, not simply a situation where a predator has infiltrated for the sole purpose of interfering with a child. "My client feels a genuine sense of loss at having breached the trust of the whole family, and having lost that legitimate aspect of his relationship with them." Aeberhard, 67, of Craigieburn in Victoria, pleaded guilty to six child sex offences including unlawful sexual intercourse. Between April 1999 and June 2001, he repeatedly assaulted his victim  who cannot be named  at locations in and around the northern suburbs. The victim claimed Aerhard further assaulted him on occasions where he accompanied him to Victoria  allegations Mr Sale today asked the court to ignore. "My client remains at risk of those allegations being taken up by Victorian authorities," he said. "Your Honour should have no regard to them in sentencing." He also asked the court disregard his client's prior convictions, in 1984 and 1992, for child sex offences. "My client is remorseful and has taken steps toward his own rehabilitation at his own expense," he said. "He is painfully aware that his guilty pleas make it inevitable he will serve an immediate jail term." Judge Kevin Nicholson remanded Aeberhard on continuing bail for sentencing next month. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/pedophile-misses-family-of-victim/story-e6freol3-1111118807770|/images/peter_aeberhard_1.jpg

MIHO CHRISTIAN ALAVIJA (Miho Alavija) ( SA - Coober Pedy - Formerly of Croatia)|43 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced to life in jail - 20 yrs non parole.. To face parole board hearing in October 2013..Likely to be deported to Croatia upon release.|Miho Christian Alavija - Rape/ Murder - Alavija raped 22 yr old German tourist Anne Neumann and then threw her down a mineshaft at Coober Pedy, South Australia in 1993. "Miho Christian Alavija, who raped and killed Anne Neumann at Coober Pedy, to be deported back to Croatia" (1-10-2013) The man responsible for one of South Australia's most horrific murders is likely to be deported to Croatia this month. Miho Christian Alavija, who raped German tourist Anne Neumann and then threw her down a mineshaft at Coober Pedy in 1993, was advised by the Immigration Department on September 9 that his visa had been revoked and he would be deported when he was released from prison on parole. Alavija, now 43, was sentenced to life with a 20-year non-parole period after being convicted of Ms Neumann's 1993 murder. That non-parole period expired on September 8. Sources have revealed Alavija will face a Parole Board hearing later this month. If parole is approved, the recommendation will go before Executive Council for ratification. If approved, Alavija will be deported immediately or held in a detention centre until a flight is arranged. It is understood Alavija is not objecting to being deported. He has made several attempts to have his custodial sentence transferred to Croatia over the past decade. Parole Board spokesman Kevin Hill said Alavija's parole application would not be influenced by any decision made by authorities to deport him. "His matter will be considered in the same way every other lifer is considered,'' he said. "The Parole Board will be applying the criteria for release that is required under the Act. Those criteria include, principally, a determination if he remains a threat to the community. If that remains the case the Board may well refuse that release.'' The disappearance of Ms Neumann, 22, sparked one of the largest investigations in SA history, as police grappled with a possibility a serial killer may have been targeting women in Coober Pedy. She vanished just 19 months after Italian tourist Anna Rosa Liva disappeared and three years after local girl Karen Williams was last seen in the Outback town. While Alavija was a person of interest from the outset in the Neumann case - he was one of the last people seen talking to her when he gave her a lift in his car - he was not arrested for another eight weeks. The breakthrough came when one of two men he had told about her murder contacted police and led detectives to the murder scene on the Olympic opal field, 9km from the town. Ms Neumann's body was recovered from the mine shaft two days later. The disappearance of Anna Rosa Liva and Karen Williams are not connected to the Neumann murder - Alavija was not in Coober Pedy when both vanished. Former Major Crime Detective Sergeant Mick Standing, who arrested Alavija, said he felt his non-parole period was "somewhat lenient''. "It was one of the most brutal murders that I ever investigated,'' he said. "She was alive when he threw her down the mineshaft and he lied all the way through our inquiry and the trial. I thought he deserved more than 20 years.'' A spokesman for the Croatian consulate in Canberra said any criminal who served their prison sentence was free to enter Croatia, but it was likely Interpol would notify Croatian authorities when such a person was deported there. CASE THAT SHOCKED A NATION German backpacker Anne Neumann, 22, arrived in Coober Pedy on a bus from Alice Springs on the night of July 14, 1993. She was last seen later that night in local man Miho Alavija's car. She was reported missing two days later when the owner of the hostel she had booked into noticed her bed had not been slept in. An unprecedented investigation was launched, but for eight weeks her whereabouts remained a mystery despite numerous police appeals. The breakthrough came when a local man contacted police and advised them a friend of his had information on the case. That man, and then a second, led police to the mineshaft containing Ms Neumann's body. At Alavija's trial the jury heard he had taken the two men to the mineshaft the day after he had murdered her. The pair gave evidence at the trial and he was convicted and given a life sentence with a 20-year non-parole period. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/miho-christian-alavija-who-raped-and-killed-anne-neumann-at-coober-pedy

News (28-3-2008)- "Family 'appalled' over 6 month sentence for nursing home rapist" The family of an elderly dementia patient who was raped by a carer in her nursing home say they are appalled that her attacker has been sentenced to serve only six months in jail. Thirty-six-year-old Henry Alexander was found guilty of raping the 85-year-old woman while he was washing her at her Mount Eliza nursing home in 2005. In court today Alexander was sentenced to three years, but two-and-a-half years of the sentence were suspended, meaning he will serve just six months behind bars. In sentencing Alexander, Judge Michael Bourke said the offence was a serious breach of trust of a most vulnerable woman. But he said he believed it was a spontaneous event and Alexander was otherwise of good character. He said the penalty would seem light to many people, but it would be unjust to give Alexander more jail time. He said Alexander was a devoted father to his two children and did not suffer from a psychosexual disorder. Outside court a spokeswoman for the victim said the sentence was grossly inadequate and sent the wrong message to the community. Representatives of the victim's family said they were "appalled". http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/28/2201517.htm|/images/Henry_Alexander_1.jpg

News (26-4-2010) "Child sex offender appeals"- A court of Criminal Appeal in the matter of David Walter Allen was not reported correctly in Monday's Port News. Allen pleaded guilty to two charges - sexual intercourse with a child under 10 and kidnapping. He was sentenced in the District Court on February 11, 2009. On the sexual intercourse charge he was sentenced to 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. On the kidnapping charge he was sentenced to eight years with a non-parole period of six years. Allen appealed the severity of these sentences. On March 16, the CCA allowed only part of the appeal. It reduced the kidnapping sentence to six years with a non-parole period of four years. Given the kidnapping sentence was to be served concurrently with the sexual intercourse sentence, the change effectively makes no difference to the amount of time Allen will spend in jail. He will still serve 10 years for the sexual intercourse offence.

He was sentenced to a further three years behind bars, to be served concurrently, in 2002 after he pleaded guilty to fresh allegations involving a nine-year-old boy and a 10-year-old boy.

He was refused parole again at a private hearing yesterday but will have another opportunity during a public hearing at Parramatta on March 29. The retired butcher and former football coach preyed on boys for 33 years, recruiting them by preaching the joys of independence and risk-taking and encouraging them to drink. He told a psychiatrist that the boys were special to him and claimed to have loved them. If they resisted his advances he would often resort to tears, tantrums and bribes and, in some cases, physical and emotional cruelty. One victim said that Allen would often play a game of blindman's buff, covering his eyes and then fondling the genitals of several young boys in order to guess their identities.

To be updated.|Convicted Paedophile. Victims were children aged 4-10yrs old. "Notorious paedophile jailed after breaching release order" (16 -9-2009) A convicted paedophile was today remanded in custody after a Supreme Court judge deemed him a risk to the community. Paul Allen pleaded guilty to a string of charges stemming from breaches of a conditional release order he was placed on after serving out a prison sentence. Allen, who is in his late 20s, admitted to the breaches in the Stirling Gardens Magistrate's earlier this month. Created under the Dangerous Sex Offenders Act, Allens release order stipulated he was not allowed to collect or obtain images of children. The Supreme Court was told that he collected images of children, which were not pornographic, from the internet and by cutting out photographs from magazines and newspapers. The court was also told that he had neglected to take anti-libido medication to reduce his sex drive. At todays appearance, a sentence over his breaches was supposed to be delivered by Justice Peter Blaxell, however, sentencing was postponed after the judge granted an adjournment until November due to further charges resulting from the breaches. His lawyer David McKenzie argued Allen should have his bail extended because he had not breached the conditions since his arrest. But Justice Blaxell denied the request, agreeing with prosecutors that Allen should be remanded in custody. Justice Blaxell said that downloading and collecting images was a trigger for re-offending. "In these circumstances if the accused is not kept in custody he could be a risk," he said. The detention of Allen comes the same week that serial sex offender Michael McGarry is due to appear in the Supreme Court, where it will be argued whether or not to keep him in custody after he pleaded guilty to breaching a condition of his release order. The notorious sex monster was arrested less than 10 days after his August 17 release by Supreme Court Justice Lindy Jenkins, who subjected him to the unprecedented supervision order containing 52 strict conditions. The court has suppressed all details of the alleged breaches other than the fact that McGarry was not accused of sexual reoffending. In 2006 Allen was released from prison only for the Director of Public Prosecutions to loge an application to have him detained indefinitely under the Dangerous Sexual Offenders Act. .

News (8-7-2011)- "Port Stephens bus driver indecently assaulted 16-y-o girl" A fifty-seven-year-old Port Stephens bus driver convicted of indecently assaulting a 16-year-old girl told police he was keen to pursue a relationship with the teenager because he thought she "wanted to take it further". Ross Frederick Allen received a one-year suspended jail sentence yesterday after Newcastle Local Court magistrate John Chicken previously found one count of aggravated indecent assault proven. Allen, of Marty Avenue, Salamander Bay, was an upholsterer and driver at Port Stephens Coaches, a police statement said. The company expected to keep Allen on as an upholsterer, a letter tendered to the court stated. Allen was alone with the girl at a home on April 18 last year when he walked up behind her and put his hands on her hips, the court heard. The girl said that Allen then put his hand in her pants and molested her, but Allen told police that he only touched the girl on the hips and any contact in her pants was accidental. He previously pleaded not guilty, but was convicted following a hearing. When asked by detectives during an interview if he wanted to pursue a relationship with the girl, Allen replied: "Oh possibly later on, yeah . . . you know, if she was amenable to it". He also told police that he thought the girl "wanted to take it further". The girl told police she was initially shocked then became upset and told a friend. Police were notified the next day. Mr Chicken said Allen "perceived there was some encouragement from this young lady" and that Allen exercised "very poor judgment". "These types of offences are extraordinarily serious," Mr Chicken said. "They can have significant psychological impacts on the victims." Mr Chicken declined to send Allen to jail because he had good rehabilitation prospects and the offence appeared a "momentary aberration". http://www.theherald.com.au/story/472948/port-stephens-bus-driver-indecently-assaulted-16-y-o-girl/|/images/ross_frederick_allen_2.jpg

GORDON ANTHONY ALLWOOD (QLD- Ipswich)|42 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced May 2012, to 2 yrs jail - including time spent in custody Allwood will be eligible for parole 14-7-2012.|Gordon Allwood- Pleaded guilty to unlawful stalking. Stalked a 15 yr old girl. Registered sex offender/ Repeat Offender- Criminal history includes convictions for aggravated sexual assault, and indecent treatment of boys. News (14-5-2012)- "Paedophile likely to offend again"- An Ipswich paedophile will pose a real risk of reoffending once he is released from jail for stalking a teenage girl, Ipswich District Court heard. Gordon Anthony Allwood, 42, met a 15-year-old girl and her father in Gatton last January when they arrived to offer assistance to flood victims. Allwood spent four months stalking the teenager via indecent text messages, following her to work and watching her when she was out. Crown prosecutor Sarah Maleckas told the court the girl and her family were scared and distressed by Allwood's "grooming" behaviour. Allwood pleaded guilty to unlawful stalking in March and the case was adjourned until Friday for his defence to obtain a psychiatric report. The report declared Allwood refused to accept what he did was wrong. Judge Deborah Richards said Allwood still denied responsibility for his actions and did not understand the significance of his behaviour. She said Allwood would pose a real risk of further offending once released. Allwood was sentenced to two years jail. With time already spent in custody, he will be eligible to apply for parole on July 14. Allwood also pleaded guilty to failing to comply with his reporting obligations as a registered sex offender and was sentenced to six months prison, to be served concurrently with the two-year head sentence. In March the court heard Allwood told his victim he had an 18-year-old friend named David and pretended to be him in some of the texts. He also asked for naked photos of her and offered to send her naked photos of himself. Ms Maleckas noted Allwood had almost identical offences in his criminal history, which included convictions for aggravated sexual assault and indecent treatment of boys. http://www.qt.com.au/story/2012/05/14/pedophile-likely-to-offend-again/ http://www.qt.com.au/story/2012/03/31/childs-stalker-struck-at-flood-shelter/
MOHAMAD MOHOUD ALNAGHY (Mohamad Alnaghy) (NSW - Dapto)|58 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in May 2013, in the Wollongong Local Court, to 12 months jail.|Mohamad Mohmoud Alnaghy - Former high-school science teacher - Pleaded guilty to a single charge of procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activity. Alnaghy repeatedly tried to lure a 12 yr old boy into the toilets at Westfield Warrawong -below. "Dapto paedophile jailed for trying to lure boy" (30-5-2013) A self-confessed paedophile who repeatedly tried to lure a young boy into the toilets at Westfield Warrawong has lodged an appeal against a 12-month prison sentence. Former high-school science teacher Mohamad Mohmoud Alnaghy, 58, of Dapto, had pleaded guilty to a single charge of procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activity. He had admitted trying to coax the 12-year-old into the shopping centre's toilets with the promise that he would buy him "anything" if the child touched his genitals. Magistrate Darryl Pearce rejected a request from Alnaghy's lawyer, Aaron Kernaghan, to impose a suspended prison sentence instead of full-time jail. Wollongong Local Court heard that the victim was at the shopping centre with friends on the morning of February 23 this year, when one of the boys initially approached Alnaghy and asked for $1. Alnaghy said he didn't have the coin but would return when he got change. A short time later Alnaghy spotted the victim near Foot Locker and approached him, telling him he had to touch him if he still wanted the cash. The pair sat down on a lounge in the centre and Alnaghy began to touch the boy before suggesting they go to the Hoyts Cinema toilet so the boy could touch him. The court heard that Alnaghy had unsuccessfully tried to coax the boy into the disabled toilet. Alnaghy then took the boy into a store at the centre and told him he could have anything if he agreed to touch him. Alnaghy again tried to lure the child into nearby toilets. But when that failed, he forced him into a fire exit. There he asked the boy to give him his underwear, but the boy refused. He eventually escaped from Alnaghy via the car park and alerted security guards to what had happened. Facing court yesterday, Alnaghy said he considered himself a paedophile and asked to be given treatment for his condition. A psychologists report found that Alnaghy had a psycho-sexual disorder, in part due to his own experience of being sexually abused as a child while in a refugee camp in Lebanon. The court heard that Alnaghy had handed himself in to police and made full admissions about the incident. This led Mr Kernaghan to ask for leniency. However, prosecutor Jackie Azad argued that Alnaghy had repeatedly pursued the boy over a number of hours and used cigarettes and money to try to get the child to touch him. The protection of the community is paramount, she told the court, in seeking for Alnaghy to be put behind bars. Magistrate Pearce acknowledged that Alnaghy was remorseful for his actions but said full-time prison was the appropriate sentence given the seriousness of the crime. Alnaghy lodged an immediate severity appeal, but his application to be released on bail in the interim was rejected. http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/1536943/dapto-paedophile-jailed-for-trying-to-lure-boy/

The Supreme Court in Darwin heard that following the rape, the woman felt no good. I feel like killing myself, she said in her victim impact statement. Mr Anderson told a court hearing in February that he had had a long-standing sexual relationship with the victim but later admitted this was not true. Justice Barr said although Anderson was not gratuitously violent towards his victim, he had forced himself upon her using his superior strength and body position and took advantage of the fact the woman was initially asleep and unable to protect herself. An eight month balance of sentence - arising from an incident where he inadvertently struck a three-year-old in the face with a knife - was included in the sentence. A non-parole period of three years, seven months applies. http://tennantcreek.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/man-jailed-over-rape-of-aunt/2100705.aspx

The images he possessed were said by Magistrate Ron Saines to include the rape of pubescent and pre-pubescent females. Kerr told an earlier hearing he downloaded the child pornography for excitement. In a separate hearing Mark Anderson, 37, of Beacon Point Rd, Clifton Springs, pleaded guilty to a single count of possessing 60 images of child pornography. The court heard Anderson paid for the child pornography over the internet before local police were alerted to his activities by Federal Police. Mr Saines said the images collected by Anderson were of very young pre-pubescent females engaged in sexual acts with adult males . The clear distress of some of the victims is indicative of a serious case of child pornography, he said.

Andrews had almost 35,000 images of child pornography.  . News (27-4-2012)- "Man guilty of having 7000 child porn images"- A man yesterday told a Geelong court he accessed almost 7000 images of child pornography purely to monitor his housemate's access to the vile material, a court has heard. Francis Henderson, 72, pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates' Court yesterday to possessing child pornography. The former Eurack man has since moved to Newry in Gippsland with co-accused Douglas Andrew. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2012/04/27/322261_news.html  News(28-2-2011)- "Victim's mum's fury 'Sicko' still on streets"- THE mother of a nine-year-old girl who was indecently assaulted by Douglas Andrew doesn't have the heart to tell her that the man the family calls "sicko" is still on the streets. "She thinks that she's the little police girl, that she saved all the kids," said her mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons. "We encourage kids to stand up for themselves and then they get let down by the system." Andrew, 36, formerly of Eurack near Colac, has been sentenced to a 22-month community-based order and must complete a sex offenders program, after pleading guilty to committing an indecent act with the child. He also pleaded guilty to several counts of possessing and producing child pornography after police found him with almost 35,000 images. For these offences, Andrew was sentenced to 12 months jail, suspended for two years. The magistrate cited his supportive family environment as a reason to release him into the community. The victim's mother approached the Geelong Advertiser to express her outrage at the sentence and her fears that Andrew who had committed a similar indecent act in 2003 might reoffend. Andrew was known to the family and was found with the girl on his lap while fixing a computer in July last year. The girl later told her parents that Andrew called her over to him and touched her inappropriately. "We always thought, he's just a normal human being, maybe a bit slow," the mother said. "(The assault) could have been a million times worse. I know there's kids out there that have had horrific stuff done to them. "I just worry about what would have happened if she didn't say anything." When Andrew left Eurack to live with his father in Pakenham the girl's mother saw images of his house for sale on the internet. "There were teddies and stuff placed on the shelves. It just looked like a real kid's room. It didn't look like two grown men's house." Memories of the incident come back to the girl every time her parents talk about a man called Douglas. "She jumps every time we mention the name Douglas, so that's why we have come up with the name, "sicko". The Geelong Magistrates' Court heard Andrew spent his formative years in the welfare system where he was subjected to sexual abuse. When asked his reason for possessing and manufacturing child pornography, Andrew told police, "if you had a childhood like mine, you'd do the same thing". http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2012/04/27/322261_news.html

ROBERT JAMES ANDREWS  (SA - Pennington)|59 yrs old (2012) |Sentenced in 1996, in the SA Supreme Court to life in jail - 22 yrs non parole. |Robert Andrews - Raped and murdered (strangled) a 43 yr old Christine Jenkins in 1994, while her 2 children were asleep in the next room. Prior 1989 convicted- sentenced for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. .  Update - (10-3-20100)- A convicted murderer who has spent 16 years behind bars for strangling his girlfriend has launched another appeal to quash his conviction. Robert James Andrews is serving a life sentence with a 22-year non-parole period for the murder of Christine Jenkins, 44. He is seeking permission to appeal against his conviction and wants a retrial to examine new evidence he claims was not presented at his 1996 trial. Andrews had initially lodged action in the District Court seeking a retrial, but has withdrawn that and has now lodged a fresh application in the Supreme Court, which was heard before Justice Nyland last Monday. In the application, Andrews lists five grounds for his appeal including that DNA tests were not carried out on cigarette butts found at the crime scene and on samples taken from the victim; that key witnesses were not cross-examined in his trial and that evidence exists to suggest scratches on his face were not inflicted by Ms Jenkins, but by another woman. Andrews' previous appeals - to the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2002, to the High Court in 2003 and the Supreme Court in 2005 - have all failed. Andrews was found guilty of murdering Ms Jenkins in her Ferryden Park home in December 1994. The prosecution alleged he strangled and raped Ms Jenkins because she would not have sex after they returned from a Christmas party. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/killer-lists-grounds-for-court-appeal/story-e6frea83-1226295919085

Stephen David Andrews, 55, pleaded guilty to one count each of accessing child exploitation material and aggravated possession of child pornography. Andrews also pleaded to 11 counts of using a carriage service to transmit indecent communications to a person under the age of 16. Today in sentencing, District Court Judge Geraldine Davison said Andrews possessed thousands of images and videos of child pornography. She said in his internet communications he identified himself as a schoolteacher, made reference to masturbation and inquired if the recipients had engaged in sexual relations with a family member. The content of these conversations is depraved and disgusting, she said. Judge Davison said that in sentencing Andrews, she took into account his letter of apology to the court. In the letter, viewed by The Advertiser, Andrews wrote he was deeply ashamed of his offending, which was out of character. To the children I have harmed by viewing child pornography and continuing the demand for it, I apologise, he wrote. If I had not sought out this material, then demand and production would hopefully drop and they would be saved the agony of the abuse they have suffered. I am sorry I have perpetuated the cycle of abuse. Andrews went on to apologise to the children he chatted with in a sexual manner. I have damaged you and left you with lifelong scars, he wrote. I am ashamed I was not the adult, I am truly sorry. He wrote he had let down the profession which he loved. .|/images/stephen-david-andrews-2.jpg

Police found the piece of wood, which also had hairs on it, on the edge of the camping area at Red Cliff, on the North Coast, where the 16-year-old's remains were discovered scattered in sand dunes in October 1997. The teen, described as shy by her parents, Peter and Robyn Stace, had vanished six weeks before while hitch-hiking home from her part-time job at Bi-Lo in Yamba.

Update - "Sex fiend jailed but bailed"- A convicted paedophile walked free on bail yesterday after being jailed for 15 months for ogling children at a swimming pool. And the Herald Sun can reveal that just over a month after being caught at the pool, predator Kevin Patrick Arundell, 61, lured a single mother of a 10-year-old boy to live with him. Arundell, of Boronia, was jailed for a minimum of nine months yesterday, but was bailed after he immediately lodged an appeal, to be heard in October. He must report to police twice a week and is not permitted to enter public pools. The prosecution had argued the public, particularly children, needed protection Herald Sun- 23-7-2011. Sign the open justice petition now. Arundell, who has served nine years in jail for a child sex offence, denied a charge of being a sex offender loitering in a place frequented by children. Ringwood Magistrates' Court heard evidence from two off-duty police officers that on January 11 last year they saw Arundell duck-diving so as to spy on children as young as seven. "I was boiling inside," Sen-Det Daniel Passingham said. "I told him he was a perverted man and (to) get out of the pool." George Georgiou, for Mr Arundell, argued he had been porpoise-diving, not observing children. But magistrate Bill O'Day found Mr Arundell had been deliberately submerging to observe children. This week, a single mother from Tasmania told the Herald Sun how in February 2010 she answered an ad seeking a tenant who was a single mum. One day, she found two detectives at her home. "They asked me what I was doing there and I said 'We live here'. They were horrified. Within half an hour I received a call from child protective services basically telling me we had to get out, it was too unsafe." She said Arundell offered to look after her son when she worked nights. Both of them felt traumatised. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/predator-ogled-kids-at-pool-court-told/story-e6frf7jo-1226100074678|/images/kevin_arundell_2.jpg

"Salesian priest jailed for less than a year over sex abuse of student" (22-8-2011) A Salesian priest who sexually abused a pupil at a Sunbury Catholic boarding school will serve just nine months in jail. Judge Tim Wood told Michael Aulsebrook, 55, today he had committed a serious breach of trust when he groomed and then abused a 12-year-old boy at Rupertswood Salesian College in 1983. In his sentence the judge revealed that in 1993 a complaint of the sex abuse of another child was made against Aulsebrook and he received counselling from his order but no criminal prosecution. The Salesians then appointed Aulsebrook to the post of principal of St Mark's College in Port Pirie, South Australia, a post he held for nine years. Judge Wood said when the victim went to Rupertswood his mother introduced him to Brother Michael, a decision that later made her feel guilty. Aulsebrook groomed the boy by buying him treats from the tuck shop and over the next seven months took him into his room next to the dorm and sexually abused him. He would make the victim sit on his knee, put his hands down his pants and fondle his penis and testicles and lay on top of him on the bed. Judge Wood said the 12-year-old knew nothing about sex and was confused at the molestation. Aulsebrook pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent assault and two of the charges were representative of a number of incidents. In his County Court sentence Judge Wood said Aulsebrook told the boy "It's okay, it's a secret'' and "don't worry''. Aulsebrook remained a friends with his victim's family, attended his wedding and the funeral of his brother. The judge said the victim had a nervous breakdown in 2000 and said he had been molested but his family did not believe him at first. Judge Wood said Aulsebrook was remorseful and felt a deep sense of shame at his flawed morals. He jailed him for a total of two years but suspended 15 months of the sentence for two years. http://www.news.com.au/national/salesian-priest-jailed-for-less-than-a-year-over-sex-abuse-of-student/story-e6frfkp9-1226119669684

Avent was released from a Victorian prison on June 4 last year- 2012 after serving his minimum sentence of 18 yrs.|Nathan Avent - Child Killer - Avent murdered a 10 yr old boy with a tomahawk on 11-7-1994.. After killing the boy, Avent threatened the victim's mother with a knife, sexually assaulted and tried to strangle her. . "Convicted killer Nathan Avent released" (5-2-2013) A convicted child killer has been quietly released back into the community. Nathan Avent, who murdered a 10-year-old boy with a tomahawk in 1994, was released from a Victorian prison on June 4 last year after serving his minimum sentence of 18 years. Avent's sentencing was televised in an Australian-first when Justice Bernard Teague allowed cameras into his courtroom. Avent, then 23, killed the boy, known only as "Steven", and sexually assaulted and tried to strangle the victim's mother on July 11, 1994. The boy was playing quietly with a game on the floor of the Salvation Army-run home in Melton where he lived with his mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, when Avent struck him from behind with the axe. Avent, then of Hoppers Crossing, had tricked his way into the house to commit his crimes. He had done some landscaping at the house and Steven's mother had no reason to fear him when he arrived saying he wanted to look at the backyard. After he murdered the boy, the court heard Avent washed the blood off the axe and his hands and threatened the mother with a knife and sexually assaulted her. The mother had been in the shower at the time Avent butchered her son. The son of Salvation Army officers, Avent was unemployed and his then 19-year-old wife was pregnant when he committed his brutal crimes. Adult Parole Board general manager David Provan told Leader Newspapers that Avent was subject to a strict supervision regime and was closely monitored by Corrections Victoria. "After a thorough assessment, the board ordered that Mr Avent be released from custody on parole from June 4, 2012," he said. Under Avent's parole conditions he must tell a community corrections officer of any change in address or employment within 48 hours of the change and not leave the state without written permission of a Corrections Victoria manager. Avent's residential address would not be made public but victims of crime could register to be kept informed about parole matters concerning an offender, Mr Provan said. Avent was first sentenced to life with a minimum of 21 years by Justice Teague but then appeared before the Court of Appeal and his sentence was varied on December 22, 1995 to 25 years with a non-parole period of 18 years. The period of 529 days pre-sentence detention Avent had already served was part of the revised sentence. Avent claimed he was given a harsher sentence because of media attention on his crime and the presence of a TV camera in the court. Avent told detectives that on the morning of the murder, he "started thinking that today I would try to kill somebody". In the days before the crime, Avent had watched violent films. He had gone to the house armed with a killing kit including the tomahawk, rope, masking tape and knives. The court heard that Avent told detectives he thought that "stuff in movies" might have fuelled his murderous fantasies. It is not known if Avent has contact with the child his then-wife was expecting, who would now be a teen. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/west/convicted-killer-released/story-fngnvmj7-1226570138410 http://www.krock.com.au/index.php/news/23606-parole-board-silent-on-freed-child-killer http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/justice-seen-to-be-done/story-e6frfifx-1111114288464|/images/nathan_john_avent_2.jpg

Alfred Chatfield pleaded guilty to sexual assault, aggravated robbery and acts of indecency committed against a woman in Dickson. The 43-year-old Harrison man grabbed the woman from behind as she was walking home along Northbourne Avenue, dragging her off the footpath and demanding sex while holding a knife to her throat. The ACT Supreme Court heard Chatfield was intoxicated and could not remember the attack. The man has an extensive criminal history including three rape convictions in Victoria and has spent much of his life in jail. In sentencing Justice Hilary Penfold said Chatfield is unlikely to stop abusing drugs and alcohol and is at risk of re-offending.

Sentence increased Feb 2012, in the ACT Court of Appeal, to 3 yrs jail - Half of the term will be served by periodic detention with the remainder suspended.|Michael Stanley Cooper- The largest haul of child pornography seized in the territory (ACT). Police raided that home in January 2010 after the FBI linked Cooper to two video files containing child pornography uploaded to a website. Investigators seized almost 700 computer discs and 100 DVDs from Cooper's home; the raw data was found on seven desktop computers, one laptop computer and a number of external file storage devices. Almost 700,000 child abuse images and videos were found on the computers, disks, DVDs, devices and in A4 folders. "Judges say sentence too lenient for porn offender" (13-2-2012) The territory's top judge has said a weekend jail sentence was too lenient for a mentally ill man who amassed the largest haul of child pornography seized in the territory. But Michael Stanley Cooper will not be sent behind bars full-time because he has already served most of his periodic detention. Three judges of the ACT Court of Appeal yesterday ruled the original sentence handed down by acting Justice Nield was ''manifestly inadequate''. In May last year the judge sentenced Cooper to two years, with 12-months served by way of weekend jail and the remainder suspended with a good-behaviour order. ''We've come to the view that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and did need to be increased,'' Chief Justice Terence Higgins said yesterday. The appeal judges - Chief Justice Higgins, Justice Richard Refshauge and Justice Dennis Cowdroy - increased the total sentence to three years. Half of the term will be served by periodic detention with the remainder suspended. But Chief Justice Higgins said if he had been the sentencing judge he would have locked up Cooper full-time for six months, to be followed by a year of weekend jail. During the earlier sentencing hearings Cooper was described as a virtual recluse suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and a schizoid personality disorder. The 54-year-old had no friends, no contact with his family and lived alone at his own home. Police raided that home in January 2010 after the FBI linked Cooper to two video files containing child pornography uploaded to a website. Investigators seized almost 700 computer discs and 100 DVDs from Cooper's home; the raw data was found on seven desktop computers, one laptop computer and a number of external file storage devices. Almost 700,000 child abuse images and videos were found on the computers, disks, DVDs, devices and in A4 folders. The images range from the low end of the scale used to rank the graphic nature of child pornography - the Oliver scale - through to the highest category used to classify images of sadism or bestiality. On appeal DPP Jon White argued the judge placed too much weight on Cooper's good character and not enough weight on discouraging other would-be offenders. The director also argued weekend jail was inappropriate because of the ''inbuilt leniency''. ''It has to be accepted that because it's a significantly more lenient alternative that the wrong message can be sent if it's imposed in the wrong circumstances,'' Mr White said. The Crown had called for both an increase of the two-year head sentence and a declaration the judges would have taken a tougher stance at the outset. But the prosecution conceded it would not be appropriate to jail Cooper full-time three-quarters of the way through his weekend jail stretch. Cooper's barrister argued periodic detention was the appropriate punishment for her socially isolated, mentally ill client. The defendant will now spend his weekends behind bars until November, and the court will publish its reasons at a later date. http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/judges-say-sentence-too-lenient-for-porn-offender-20120213-1t9mq.html

Facing deportation at the end of his sentence.|Navin Edwin/ Indian National. Convicted of 17 charges including, producing and possessing child pornography, acts of indecency/ child grooming - Victims were 3 girls. "Australia jails Indian diplomat's son for paedophilia" (27-9-2013) An Australian court Thursday sentenced 34-year-old paedophile Navin Edwin, son of an Indian diplomat, to over 10 years in jail for a series of sexual offences. He faces deportation at the end of his prison term. Edwin was sentenced by the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Supreme Court judge John Burns for 10 years and eight months, backdated to take into account time spent in custody, with a non-parole period of six-and-a-half years. Burns handed down the jail term to Edwin for a series of offences against three young girls between 2009 and 2010. He will be eligible for parole in March 2017. He is expected to appeal the decision, The Canberra Times reported. Two ACT Supreme Court juries, in separate trials in May and June, rejected Edwins claims of innocence and found him guilty of 17 offences, including producing and possessing child pornography, acts of indecency and child grooming. His criminal activities were discovered after adults swapped a series of text messages with the man via an 11-year-old victims mobile phone. They notified the police, who raided Edwins home and discovered home-made child pornography. Edwin unsuccessfully attempted to explain his crimes at the two trials, claiming the pornography was part of medical research and an art project. Justice Burns said Edwin, the son of an Indian diplomat whose identity was not disclosed, had lied shamelessly under oath and continued the pattern of dishonesty since. The judge said the defendant had shown no remorse. I doubt very much that you have any understanding of the concepts of morality or conscience. These offences suggest as much, Burns said. The judge said Edwin presented a high risk of re-offending and had grave doubts about his rehabilitation. The court has previously heard the Indian national would likely be deported upon release, a course of action the judge supported. Like many offenders, Edwin hid in plain sight. He ran a business, had a long-term girlfriend, was active in the church, and performed in amateur theatre productions. But Burns said that this identity was a smokescreen to disguise his sexual attraction to young girls .|/images/navin-edwin.jpg

MICHAEL ALAN GILLARD (ACT - Canberra)|58 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Michael Alan Gillard was found guilty of an act of indecency and attempted sexual intercourse... Victim was a 13 yr old girl. "Man found guilty of child sexual abuse" (1-12-2011) A 57-year-old Canberra man has been found guilty of sexually abusing a 13-year-old girl in the mid 1990s. An ACT Supreme Court jury has found Michael Alan Gillard guilty of an act of indecency and attempted sexual intercourse with the girl when she was staying at his house between December 1995 and January 1996. Gillard was a friend of the girl's father. The victim told the court, she did not complain until 2008 because she did not want to cause any fights and she did not think anyone would believe her. Gillard shook his head when the jury returned the two guilty verdicts after only two hours. In an earlier trial, Gillard was found guilty of sexual offences against the girl's elder sister, which included forcing her to have oral sex in the presence of her younger sibling, at a time when she was above the age of consent. He is due to be sentenced for that verdict later this week. Justice John Burns has released Gillard on bail, pending his next appearance. .
PAUL HAYES (ACT - Canberra/ NSW - Sydney)|yrs old|To be updated.|Paul Hayes - Paedophile/ Repeat Offender - Former Scout leader - Found guilty in 2010, of 5 counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted illegal intercourse.. Prior History - Served a jail term for inappropriate touching of a minor in 2002. "Scouts refer sex abuse file to royal commission" (25-1-2013) Scouts Australia is referring a file on a 1980s scout leader to the royal commission into child sexual abuse. Scout leader Paul Hayes, also known by his scout name Grizzly, was accused of interfering with eight boys over a 20-month period in Canberra and Sydney. Victim Steven Cox, who was abused by Hayes, says he is disgusted with the Scouts for failing to report the matters to police. He has accused the association of putting its reputation ahead of the welfare of the children in its care. Mr Cox says he has found internal Scout documents that show at least eight other complaints were lodged against the paedophile. "It's just a cover-up. That's all it was - it was a cover-up to protect the Scouts' name and keep it all quiet so it never got out anywhere," he said. "To me they're just as guilty as him. They may not have done the abuse, but they knew all about him and did nothing." Mr Cox's life changed forever in 1984 after Hayes invited him to go sailing on the Georges River in Sydney. During two of these excursions, he was forced to masturbate the scout leader and was subjected to attempted penetration. "When he picked me up on the Friday afternoon, I hadn't been in the car more than five minutes before he placed his hand on my thigh and then placed my hand on his thigh," he said. "It was like that all the way home. When we got back to his place it got a lot worse." Mr Cox, now 40, now finds it hard to enjoy even the simple pleasures of life. He loves boating, but even a day on the water reminds him of his heavy and painful burden. "It eats at you. It's hard because even now there's not many days go by where at some point during the day or night you think what happened," he said. "You don't forget it and it just slowly eats away at you." 'Darkest secrets' The young scout kept these assaults a secret until he was in his 20s when he told his parents. But it was not until 2008 when he decided to go to the police, driving with his wife from Brisbane down to New South Wales where the offence took place. "It was the hardest thing I've done in my life, to sit there and tell someone your deepest, darkest secrets," he said. "Even with your wife sitting beside you - she knew I'd been abused but she didn't know what had happened, as I said I'd told no-one." Mr Cox later discovered Hayes had already served a jail term for inappropriate touching of a minor in 2002. His testimony led to Hayes serving two more years in jail after a jury in 2010 found him guilty of five counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted illegal intercourse. Perpetrator 'exploited' Hayes was involved with the 15th Canberra troop when the first accusation of abuse surfaced against him in the early 1980s. He was accused of raping a 10-year-old boy after a performance of the Scout production known as the Gang Show. In a written complaint to the Scouts, the boy's mother quoted her son giving explicit details of abuse on at least five occasions. Hayes denied everything and the Scout committee appointed to consider the complaint gave him a sympathetic hearing. One committee member attempted to discredit the victim by explaining the boy had close relatives who were homosexual. The committee debated whether to refer the matter to police but instead decided to seek legal advice. The lawyer later wrote back, saying: "It seems your association has done all that you should in the circumstances... I have a sneaking suspicion that Mr Hayes has been cleverly exploited." Hayes had his permit to act as a scout official suspended for only six weeks. Within months he was appointed leader of the troop in a Scout hall in Sydney. The Scout's website claims the association has a decades-long practice of reporting all suspected abuse. 'Very sad' When the allegations against Hayes first arose, the Scouts made no reports to police. Scouts Australia says it did not go to police because of the wishes of most of the boys' parents. However, one family did advise authorities. Chief commissioner of Scouts Australia Reg Williams denies there was a cover-up and that its actions were not unusual. Mr Williams says the organisation has improved its reporting practices since then. "Yes, I'm disappointed," he said. "I'm very sad to see this situation occur, but you've got to go back and look in the shoes of the people of the day." The Scout Association is referring the file on Hayes to the royal commission into child abuse, and in response to 7.30's inquiries has referred another file involving a contemporary of Hayes to NSW police. "We've upped the ante to community expectation standard, our own standard and we believe we've got a very high standard and we're going to work at it," Mr Williams said. "I, as the leader of the Scout movement, am determined that we're going to be pursuing these sort of perpetrators and minimise the chance of this sort of thing happening again." http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-24/scouts-refer-sex-abuse-case-to-royal-commission/4483034

News (21-12-2012)- "Police pursue paedophiles for sharing porn in jail" Convicted paedophiles in Canberra's jail have allegedly set up a pornography ring, sharing electronic images of child sex abuse under the noses of prison guards. Several investigations are under way into how the three prisoners, two of them the ACT's most dangerous child sex predators, were able to obtain and share files containing the material while serving their sentences at the Alexander Maconochie Centre. It is even alleged that a child pornography website was hosted from within the prison before police raided it on Tuesday. The ACT government's Justice and Community Safety directorate is set to come under intense scrutiny to explain how the alleged ring was allowed to develop. The prison's intelligence unit began passing information to jail authorities about the men's suspected activities several months ago but it is unclear what led to the delay in calling in police. Central to the alleged plot was a laptop computer which a fourth prisoner, who has since been released, had permission to bring into the jail despite the misgivings of some guards. The USB drives, which look like cigarette lighters in prison X-ray security screening images, are relatively easy to smuggle into jail and can be plugged into ports on the set-top boxes. The technical expertise is believed to have been developed and shared by an offender, who cannot be named for legal reasons, who served four years of a nine-year sentence for what a judge described as ''premeditated and predatory'' rapes of a 10-year-old boy. The paedophile, an IT expert, was deported to his native South Africa after serving his four-year non-parole period and being found to have behaved well while in jail. But before his release he was allowed to have a laptop computer which allegedly led to the development of the pornography ring. Another man suspected to be involved - Aaron James Holliday - is serving a 16-year sentence for a string of offences against young boys. He has been described as a computer expert. Holliday was alleged by police to have developed an amateurish, and unsuccessful, plot while in jail to silence once of his victims, a 15-year-old boy, by having the youth murdered. Another of the suspects, whose name is also suppressed by the courts, is serving 10 years for several offences, including abusing his one-year-old son and sharing footage of the acts with other online offenders. He was also convicted of possessing 23,549 images and 1013 videos of child pornography and also abused the children of friends to produce the material. The third man is remanded in custody at the jail, awaiting trial for allegedly using a child for the production of pornography and other offences. An ACT Policing spokesman said detectives were examining several devices seized in Tuesday's raid. ''The contents of the computers and devices are being reviewed by AFP Digital Forensics,'' he said. http://www.smh.com.au/national/police-pursue-paedophiles-for-sharing-porn-in-jail-20121220-2bpfj.html News (15-11-2002)- "Schools, scouts to co-operate in commission" One of the ACT's most notorious convicted paedophiles, Aaron James Holliday, was a former trainee leader of the Scouts in 2007, while a member of the older Venturers section group, for members aged 13-18, was convicted of child sex offences against a 13-year-old girl he met in the movement in 2004. -read more- http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/schools-scouts-to-cooperate-in-commission-20121114-29d0c.html#ixzz2H5FQzxSe News (29-11-2010) A Canberra man who had sex with underage boys after telling them they were training to catch paedophiles, will spend at least the next six years behind bars. Aaron James Holliday pleaded guilty to committing an act of indecency on a child, two counts of possessing child pornography and eight counts of engaging in sexual intercourse with minors. The 24-year-old befriended his three child victims before abusing them. He told two of the boys they were being trained for a program called "pedobait" to help police catch paedophiles. He took them to Mt Majura for what he told them was a training session and then engaged in sexual acts with them. When police arrested Holliday they found 11,000 child pornography images on his computer. In sentencing, Justice Richard Refshauge said Holliday deceived his victims in a sinister way and the abuse had long lasting affects on the children. Justice Refshauge took into account Holliday himself had been abused at boarding school. He sentenced Holliday to 14 years and six months in jail, with a non-parol period of seven years from April last year. Call for action- The parents of one of the victims is calling on governments to do more to stop child pornography. The father says child pornography encouraged Holliday to commit the crimes. "The internet industry basically have this lie, where they turn around and say it's not their responsibility," he said. "Well crap, they sell it, they should make sure it's safe for people who buy it and they don't, and the Government doesn't require them to do it. It's about time they did." The boy's mother says while the case has been a nightmare for everyone invovled, the bigger problem is child pornography in general. "I really think governments should stand up, not only pass the laws but to dam well enforce them, and put the resources behind it to enforce the law about chid pornography and pornography generally." But she's relieved the case is over. "It's closure for our boys," she said. "They're really brave. But no one can take any satisfaction out of this horrible situation... it's a nightmare for everyone." "We're pleased the courts have taken the issue seriously and are helping keep our children safe." http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-24/man-jailed-for-having-sex-with-boys/2350156 http://www.mychristiandaily.com/index.php/aus/172-news-item-4-australia-nz/4238-claims-of-paedophile-porn-ring-in-act-jail http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-11/parents-tell-of-anger-over-sons-sexual-abuse/2332492 News (10-5-2007)- " Male nanny porn charge" A male nanny allegedly caught with thousands of pornographic images of children also performed an act of indecency in front of a 12-year-old boy, a Canberra court heard today.

Craig Paul Meyboom was sentenced in the ACT Supreme Court yesterday for sexual assault, common assault and three acts of indecency committed in 2006. Meyboom attacked the young woman in April 2006, sexually assaulting her and stealing her mobile phone. Two days later he committed acts of indecency towards two other young women and committed another indecent act in June 2006. Meyboom pleaded guilty to the acts of indecency but not guilty to the sexual assault. He stood trial for the assault and was found guilty earlier this year. In a victim impact statement read out in court, the sexual assault victim said she would not wish her feelings of helplessness and pain on her worst enemy. She wrote that she suffered continuing post-traumatic stress disorder and vivid flashback nightmares. She had also experienced mental breakdowns since the attack. The woman said the five-year wait for a trial and for a sentence had been paralysing and excruciating for her spirit. "I deserve justice for what has been done to me," she wrote. Meyboom has been in custody since 2006. The court heard Meyboom, who had been on parole at the time of the offences, had suffered a "rapid descent" into drug use after resigning from a highly stressful job. His barrister said Meyboom had been working as a cleaner and been promoted to a management position but was unable to cope with the added stress the job brought. He had also suffered from the effects of "grossly inadequate" parenting, growing up in a household where drugs were freely available, his lawyer said. The author of a pre-sentence report said Meyboom consumed up to 25 standard drinks a night on weekends, injected drugs and took four Valium tablets a night to get to sleep. The court heard Meyboom had completed self-help and rehabilitation programs while in prison but had refused to discuss the sexual offences with the report author. The prosecution said the offences involved attacks on strangers in public places and Meyboom's use of violence against women going about their daily lives was distressing. Chief Justice Terence Higgins sentenced Meyboom to a total of 7 years in prison with a non-parole period of five years. He backdated the sentence to 2007. Meyboom will be eligible for parole in November 2012. http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/jail-for-sex-attack-that-left-victim-with-nightmares/2115025.aspx http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-02-04/serious-flaws-in-police-lab-work/1930308 http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-134472766/pharmacy-robbery-man-remand.html

Jail for child predator (18-2-2011) A Canberra man who planned to have sex with a 12-year-old child he met on the internet, will serve another six months in jail. Alan Winston Priest, 60, pleaded guilty in the ACT Supreme Court to using a carriage service to procure a young person. An undercover Australian Federal Agent, pretending to be a 12-year-old boy called Jamie, chatted to Priest online during April and May 2008. Priest, aged 57 at the time, told Jamie his age and spoke explicitly to him about sex. He organised to meet the boy at the Lyneham shops saying: "All I ask is you never tell anyone, not even your best friend. I would be in big trouble if anyone found out." Priest cancelled the initial meeting telling Jamie, "If you are not who you say you are, I am in big trouble." But Priest soon organised another meeting, telling Jamie, "If anyone says anything, I am your uncle and you are my nephew." Police arrested Priest at the Lyneham shops in May 2008. The crown argued the case called for a punishment of specific and general deterrence. The lawyer said, "The evidence is clear. Mr Priest ...knew what he was doing, knew it was wrong and illegal. He nevertheless persisted." Priest's defence lawyer argued his client had undergone the Adult Sex Offenders Program and he was anxious to continue treatment. Justice Hilary Penfold sentenced Priest to three years and nine months imprisonment, backdated to August 2010. Priest will be eligible for parol in August this year. http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/18/3142979.htm?site=news http://the-riotact.com/dunlop-man-charged-with-child-sex-offences/7483

The former Spanish teacher previously pleaded guilty to using the internet to groom a child for sex. At his work, police found explicit images of Tamayo del Solar with an 8-year-old girl. He later pleaded guilty to two counts of committing acts of indecency, possessing child pornography and using a child to produce pornography. Tamayo del Solar has been in custody since he was arrested three years ago. The ACT Supreme Court has not set a sentencing date. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-15/man-found-guilty-of-act-of-indecency-on-young-girl/4465604

SHANE WILLIAMS  (ACT - Campbell)|40 yrs old (2014) |Sentenced in January 2014, to 7.5 yrs jail - 4.5 yrs no parole..Eligible for parole March 2018. Sentenced in 1996 to 5.5 yrs jail - 3.5 yrs non parole.|Shane Williams/ Paedophile/ Repeat offender/ Indigenous offender- Jailed in 2014, for the sexual assault of a 3 yr old girl in the Belconnen Library. Prior history includes - In 1996 Williams abducted and molested 3 girls aged 6-10 yrs old.  "Serial child molester jailed for assaulting young girl in library" (29-1-2014) A despicable child molester who sexually assaulted a three-year-old girl in a public library while her mother was just metres away has been sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison. Shane Williams, 40 of Campbell, was walking to a police station, when he entered the Belconnen Library to go to the toilet in September last year. Williams is a paedophile with an appalling 20-year history of crimes against children, and was on bail for the racist bashing of his neighbour, who he had accused of stealing his country, ten months earlier. While in the library, a three-year-old girl came up to him in a friendly manner and said hello. The vulnerable young girl had walked away from her mother, who was using the library computers nearby. Williams told her to sit down with him, before pulling down his and her pants and beginning to sexually assault her. The girls mother, noticing her child had wandered off, came looking for her, and stumbled onto the terrible scene. She screamed, and Williams ran off, eventually arrested some days later. He admitted what he had done to police, telling them he was highly intoxicated at the time, after drinking wine and beer, and smoking four cones of cannabis. Williams was charged with sexual intercourse with a minor, and faced the ACT Supreme Court for sentencing for the child molestation and earlier assault offence. The court heard that Williams had bashed his African neighbour in November 2012, after knocking on his door and expressing anger that the victim was taking his country. Williams, who was heavily intoxicated, walked off, and the victim walked outside to get something from his car. But the 40-year-old returned, grabbing the victim and punching him in the mouth. The blow knocked the man to the ground, and Williams continued to deliver punches to his face and head until a witness ran out and told him to stop. The victim suffered a very nasty laceration to his lip, requiring hospitalisation, and still suffers physical and psychological harm. Chief Justice Helen Murrell sentenced Williams to seven years and six months jail for both crimes on Wednesday, setting a non-parole period of four years and six months. He has already served time in custody, and will first be eligible for release in March 2018. Crown prosecutor Sara Gul said the community needed protection from Williams, who had an appalling history of over 20 years of offences against the most vulnerable members of the community. Ms Gul said he posed a significant danger and appeared to have little chance of rehabilitation. Chief Justice Murrell acknowledged the impacts the crimes would likely have had on all victims, including the young girls mother. I would be amazed if the mother did not suffer serious psychological effects from the incident, she said. She said no one would expect their daughter not to be safe in a public library. That would have been extremely upsetting for the mother and no doubt her memories of that moment remain vivid. Williams himself went through a terrible childhood, where he was severely neglected, physically and sexually abused, and started drinking at 12, and using cannabis at 10. Chief Justice Murrell said Williams was subjected to sexual abuse of the most heinous type as a child. His alcoholic father beat him regularly, and his mother left him when he was young. Chief Justice Murrell said this level of disadvantage was, unfortunately, typical of indigenous offenders.  . Search

News (9-11-2009)- A Sudanese refugee was drunk and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder when he assaulted and groped seven young women who were catching public transport or walking home from work, a court has been told. Emmanuel Augustino Bago, 26, pleaded guilty today to eight charges including four of sexual assault and one of unlawful stalking. The Brisbane District Court was told the majority of the offences occurred in just a few hours on February 26, while the women were catching trains in Brisbane's north. Prosecutor David Meredith said Bago approached and harassed women who were waiting on the station platform, trying to hug them and asking for drugs. He would then grope their breasts or crotch before moving on to his next victim. Mr Meredith said Bago also assaulted one woman on the train, and followed others outside the station as they walked to their cars, or walked home from work. On one occasion, the court was told, he dragged a woman off the street and tried to push her into a ditch. He then used a large stick to try to attack a driver who stopped to assist her. The court was told Bago had been addicted to alcohol and cannabis at the time, and had also been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder from when he was living in war-torn Sudan. He moved to Australia as a refugee in 2004. The court heard since these offences he has been living in Toowoomba, where he has been receiving assistance to rehabilitate. He was sentenced to six months' jail, after which he will be released on probation for two years. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/man-groped-stalked-brisbane-public-transport-users-court-20091123-iu6r.html#ixzz22SjLbwQm

The man claims he was sexually abused weekly by his art teacher, convicted paedophile William Alexander Baine, between 1963 and 1966. At the time the school was called Lyndale High School. The former student is suing the Government, claiming it was negligent in its duty of care to protect him and failed to carry out adequate checks on Baine's background. The man also alleges the school failed to investigate suspicious behaviour by Baine which included covering windows and door panels with paper. A writ lodged with the County Court in Melbourne this month states the former student has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, panic attacks and loss of intimacy in relationships and cannot work because of the abuse. In 2003 Baine, then 75, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment in New Zealand for indecently assaulting seven teenage boys while he was a teacher there.

PHILLIP KEVIN BALDOCK (Phillip Kevin Baldock) (TAS)|42 yrs old (2013)|To be updated.|Phillip Baldock - Rapist - Baldock pleaded guilty to one count each of rape and aggravated burglary. "Rapist pleads guilty" (23-11-2013) A low-IQ alcoholic who raped an elderly Burnie woman and left her half- naked and unable to move will be sentenced on December 11. Phillip Baldock yesterday pleaded guilty to one count each of rape and aggravated burglary. He was caught out by DNA evidence the Supreme Court in Burnie, heard. The crimes took place earlier this year. Crown prosecutor Linda Mason said the woman was at home making her dinner when she heard a noise. She went to investigate and saw a man she did not know. That was Baldock. He told her he was looking for his dog and asked if she had seen it. She walked out, Miss Mason said, and Baldock slapped her face, pushed her to the floor, partially undressed her, raped her and slapped her face again when she tried to yell. He left her lying there, where she was later found. Police conducted a search of the area, Miss Mason said, and located Baldock a few doors away. He told them he had been drinking and had stopped where they found him to urinate. There was no reason for police to question that, Miss Mason said, and they let him go. They later went to his address with a search warrant after DNA evidence came back. They interviewed him for nearly two hours. He denied any connection with the rape for about 80 minutes, then police explained the DNA evidence linking him to the crime. Miss Mason said: "He said `I will admit I done it, I was pretty drunk'." "I don't remember a lot because I was drunk." Miss Mason said the impact of the crime had been significant to the victim and to her family. Miss Mason told Chief Justice Alan Blow Baldock left the victim in a vulnerable state without recourse to help. Tamara Jago, for Baldock, said he was ashamed and disgusted by his crime. She said he had a significant history of criminality, but no previous history of sexual offences. Miss Jago said Baldock was a low-IQ alcoholic and more likely than not to have a neurological impairment due to his alcoholism. Baldock (42 at the time of the rape) had poor impulse control and limited ability to understand and comply with normal social expectations. She said he had lived a very lonely and dysfunctional life since becoming an adult and has sometimes lived on the streets, in parks and so on. He had been reliant on Centrelink payments all his adult life and was in public housing and had no friends at the time of the crime. Miss Jago said he estimated he had consumed two 375mm bottles of spirits and 12 stubbies of beer before the crime. She said he did not know whose house it was when he went there and had no memory of slapping the woman. Baldock has been in jail since police interviewed him. Miss Jago said jail would help with his alcoholism and had given him the most social contact he had had in his adult life. Justice Blow remanded Baldock in custody until December 11 for sentencing. .

News - Collingwood, 46, has offended while on parole and committed serious offences across New South Wales and Western Australia, before targeting Ms H in Victoria this year. After several spells in prison, depraved Collingwood held a woman captive at knifepoint and subjected her to violent sexual assaults over 24 hours in 2000. Psychologist Dr Sid Srna said Collingwood "scored very highly on the dangerousness scale" and "presents a constant danger to the community." He added: "It is likely that his dangerousness is to increase with time and the crimes to become gradually more serious" -Below. "Violent rapist attacked woman while under supervision" (19-7-2013) A serious sex offender sent back to jail this week was under a state government supervision order and wearing an electronic ankle bracelet when he held a knife to his latest victim and violently raped her. Gary Collingwood was under an order which monitors criminals who have completed their sentences but are still considered a risk to the community. The Department of Justice can apply to the court for supervision orders and ask for conditions. This includes curfews, electronic monitoring devices, alcohol and drug bans and exclusions from certain areas if a person remains a threat. But Collingwoods victim has demanded to know why a person with a history of violent and sexual crimes, dating back to 1984, was allowed to walk free from a Western Australian jail in August last year. She believes a person deemed dangerous enough to be monitored should never be released into the community. Sarah (not her real name) was raped in January after meeting Collingwood online two months earlier. He held a knife to Sarahs face, tied electrical tape around her hands and legs and stuffed her mouth with a stocking while raping her. She believes that based on his history and poor chance of rehabilitation, Collingwood should never have been set free  or given access to the internet. She said this allowed him to prey on innocent women. This rapist was out (of prison) in August and raped me in January, he had me targeted from November, she said. He will be out when he is 57 or 60, and he will do it again. His only punishment is he cant walk out of a gate now for 13 years. Im punished for life. The sentence is almost the same as the last time he did it. Wheres the justice in that? Corrections Minister Edward ODonohue yesterday said the government was limited in how it could supervise those who had served sentences imposed by the courts. Supervision orders let us go as far as we can in supervising offenders who have done their time without breaching the constitution, he said. I have enormous sympathy for the victim in this case. But we are constitutionally limited in what we can do to restrict people who have already served the sentence the court has given them. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/1647861/violent-rapist-attacked-woman-while-under-supervision/|/images/Gary-john-barker-aka-gary-collingwood-2.jpg

Has since been released from jail.|Paedophile - Repeat Offender. "SA victim of child-sex abuse says authorities should publicly release photos of paroled paedophiles" (19-5-2014) A child-sex abuse survivor wants a photograph of her tormentor now he has been released from jail on parole  but authorities have refused, citing his right to privacy. Jean  not her real name  was repeatedly abused as a child by Raymond Edward Barnard. Now he is free she wants to both avoid him and warn the public of his evil nature. She told The Advertiser that, by refusing her request for a recent photo of Barnard, authorities were prioritising criminals over abuse survivors and potential future victims. Jean said laws allowing for offenders to be identified online if they breached their release conditions should be extended to all sex-crime parolees. This isnt about revenge, and Im now old enough to protect myself, she said. This is about protecting potential future victims, and I think the community deserves to know who these people are. In 2011, the District Court jailed Barnard for a minimum of 18 months despite an offending history dating back to 1957 and a doctors warning he still posed a significant risk to children. He had been charged with having committed 13 sex crimes against Jean, between 1979 and 1982, but pleaded guilty to two counts in a plea bargain deal. The court ruled Barnard, then 77, was at risk of becoming institutionalised were he jailed for a longer period, adding his paedophilia was in remission. Jean said that, when the Department for Correctional Services informed her of Barnards parole, she asked to be provided with a recent photograph of him. They said no because it has to do with confidentiality, so I called the police and spoke to the lady who assisted me in court, she said. She told me its the law, not so much to protect him as to protect me and the community if we come across him  meaning vigilante action. I disagree, and I think its wrong for them to protect him  the community deserves to know what he looks like so we can be protected. In March, SA Police announced it would operate a publicly-accessible online register of convicted child-sex offenders accused of breaching their release conditions. Jean said that database should be expanded to include all paroled offenders. In the US, youre allowed to know where theyre living, and I think there should be similar provisions here, she said. Whether they are in their 70s and 80s or much younger, these offenders get out and have access to more children in the community or through their computers. Weve got to do everything we can to protect potential future victims and, if we dont stand up for this, it will be swept under the carpet. Attorney-General John Rau would not be drawn on whether he would expand the law. Under laws we introduced last year the police commissioner has the power to publish personal information about child-sex offenders, including a photograph, on the commissioners website if the offender is in breach of their reporting conditions, he said. .

Barnett convinced the girl to stay overnight at his house before he took her to an early morning riding event, the court heard He met his second victim, also 14, through his first victim. At one point, he had sex with another female, in front of the girl making her watch and touch the woman's breast. He also digitally abused the girl. Barnett also met his third victim, aged 15, whom he kissed, fondled and digitally and orally abused, through the first victim. When arrested in 2004, Barnett denied he had indecently assaulted the girls saying he was in a relationship with them. ``In retrospect, it would have been much better if I just told her to go away,'' Barnett told police about one of his victims. Judge Paul Lacava said the comments showed Barnett was blaming his victims. ``In other words, you blamed (the victim) for this offending when she was a 15-year-old schoolgirl,'' Judge Lacava said. Judge Lacava said Barnett groomed the girls for his own sexual gratification. ``You were a person in a position of trust, you were a person these girls turned to for instruction on how to succeed at riding,'' Judge Lacava said. Barnett was sentenced to seven years in jail and must complete a minimum of five years before being eligible for parole. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/girls-riding-coach-jailed/story-e6frg12c-1111117083630
STEVEN PAUL BARNEY (Steven Barney)- Aboriginal descent (QLD - Brisbane)|55 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced August 2012, in the Brisbane District Court, to the 174 days he has already spent in custody - ordered to complete nine months of probation.|Steven Paul Barney- Flasher/ Repeat Offender- Barney exposed himself to a 12 yr old girl at a Brisbane swimming pool.. has a history of exposing himself to young children in the Gympie and Fraser Coast areas. "Man exposed himself to girl, 12" (8-8-2012) A flasher with a history of exposing himself to young children in the Gympie and Fraser Coast areas has now shown his genitals to a 12-year-old girl at a Brisbane pool. Steven Paul Barney, 55, did not react as Brisbane District Court heard the string of indecent exposures to children, once to a family of seven children aged 11 to two. The father of 11 children, who grew up in Gympie and spent a large portion of his life on the Fraser Coast, also had history of behaving similarly in NSW and the Northern Territory. Crown prosecutor Sam Bain said Barney had once asked four young girls to have sex with him and to remove his underwear. He said the criminal history showed no previous sentences had deterred the man from exposing himself. Defence barrister Julian Noud said his client was clearly intoxicated when police arrived at the Sandgate pool to reports of indecent exposure in February this year. "He's been in the grip of an alcohol addiction for most of his life," he said. "He accepts this is and continues to be a problem." Mr Noud said Barney, who had white hair and a long white beard, was an Aboriginal man who felt disconnected from his land and his culture. He said he turned to alcohol whenever he had a breakdown. Judge Grant Britton sentenced Barney to the 174 days he has already spent in custody and ordered him to complete nine months of probation. http://www.qt.com.au/news/man-exposed-himself-girl-12/1497737/

Victims were 7 children aged between 3 and 13 yrs. Man, 72, jailed for 11 years over abhorrent' sexual assault of seven children- (16-8-2012) A SEX grub who launched a reign of terror on his young victims spanning two decades may die in jail, a court has been told. Cecil Barter, 72, was sentenced to at least 11 years behind bars today for the abhorrent sexual assault of seven children aged between three and 13. The County Court heard Barter had badly exploited (the) dependence and trust of his young victims during the 15-year period of offending. Judge Michael Bourke said Barter had a breathtaking disregard for his victims during the assaults that occurred between 1973 and 1988. Barter pleaded guilty to all but one of 19 charges he faced but was found guilty by a jury at trial last month. Judge Bourke described the rape of one victim as a classically brutal and shameless event. He said Barter had expressed little, really no remorse over the offending. The court heard some of the victims visited him at his Wangaratta home regularly. Each child shared the desperate situation of sex abuse without any real way to stop it, Judge Bourke said. He said the offending featured the manipulation of childlike feelings and very harsh physical violence. The court heard Barters health had deteriorated significantly since his arrest in 2010 and that it was possible he would not be released from prison in his lifetime. But Judge Bourke said while Barter had no prior or subsequent criminal history he was forced to impose a significant penalty because of the abhorrent nature of offences. Barter was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years. He was also placed on the serious sex offender register for life. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/true-crime-scene/man-72-jailed-for-11-years-over-abhorrent-sexual-assault-of-seven-children/story-fnat7dhc-1226451687079

The Sun-Herald last week successfully fought for the NSW District Court to overturn a suppression order so it could report the imprisonment of Bateman, 64, almost 21 years after he sexually assaulted a boy he had met through his coaching of the Chester Hill Hornets. He was sentenced to five years' jail. The nature of Bateman's crime angered many people in the Bankstown area who considered him to be a man who had earned their trust and respect. The chief executive of the Bulldogs, Todd Greenberg, said Bateman would lose his life memberships of the Bulldogs, the Canterbury Junior Rugby League and Chester Hill Hornets at each of the respective associations' next annual meeting.

Mathew Charles Baxter was sentenced to six years' jail in the Brisbane District Court in March after pleading guilty to rape, unlawfully entering a vehicle with intent while armed, and sexual assault. The sentencing judge ordered Baxter, who was 24 when he committed the offences at Boonah on Christmas Day 2008, be eligible for parole in February 2012. During sentencing, the court was told Baxter attacked a 16-year-old girl as she walked home in the early morning, just six days after he was released from prison. Baxter followed the girl into a park, then sexually assaulted and raped her. A short time later, Baxter carjacked a woman's vehicle while pretending he had a gun. Baxter last month took his case to the Court of Appeal in Brisbane, appealing on the grounds that his sentence was manifestly excessive. In a judgment handed down today, the Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to five years, with a parole eligibility date of October next year. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/park-rapists-jail-sentence-slashed-20100903-14tk5.html#ixzz24RYQST2P
JOHN BAYER (VIC)|yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 9 yrs jail in 2008.|John Bayer- jailed for abusing 12 victims including 5 victims from the Bayswater Boys home.. In 2006, the Salvation Army secretly paid more than $1.5 million in compensation to more than 50 victims who were beaten, raped and tortured from the 1950s to 1970s by Salvation Army officers at the Bayswater home, Box Hill Boys' Home and East Kew Girls' Home, all now closed..about the Bayswater Boys home below- News (18-12-2012)- "Paedophile ring 'lent out boys'" Bayswater Boys' Home was a paedophiles' paradise, with several unexplained deaths and missing boys, and others lent to outside paedophiles, a leading abuse lawyer said on Monday. Angela Sdrinis - whose firm has represented more than 1000 wards of state, including 137 from Bayswater - said systemic abuse by Salvation Army staff was so severe that in some cases boys were killed or allowed to die from their injuries. ''I believe that children may well have been killed or at least allowed to die. Children as young as eight were allowed to abscond, with no efforts made to find them or report to the police,'' Ms Sdrinis said. ''Many of these children would have had no family and no one to take an interest in their existence. Society regarded these children as worthless, and these attitudes were mirrored by police.'' The deaths of such children may well not have been investigated, she said. In other testimony, boys from Victorian orphanages later sent to prison said that was not nearly as bad as the boys' homes, according to the Care Leavers Australia Network. It was another litany of horror at the inquiry as CLAN told of repeated and systematic rapes over years in many orphanages, physical and psychological abuse amounting to torture, and a callous indifference by police and authorities, whether church or state. CLAN chief executive Leonie Sheedy said a sample of 18 years showed that 1352 children absconded from religious and non-government homes and 1877 fled state institutions. ''A great number were running way from child rape, and sexual and other criminal assaults. What did the police do? They simply returned them to their abusers. They did not ask why the children were running away or inquire into their wellbeing,'' Ms Sheedy said. ''The boys who ran away from homes and ended up in prison have told me over and over again that prison was much better than the boys' homes.'' Ms Sdrinis said the police searched the former Bayswater Boys' Home in 2009, but no charges were laid. One victim, Rod Braybon, told police in 2009 of reports of two wards of state who died of beatings in the 1950s and were allegedly buried in the Sugarloaf Hill area of the home, while three other boys disappeared in mysterious circumstances. Ms Sdrinis said there was compelling evidence of the rape of many victims by serial abusers who were allowed to molest children for more than 20 years. ''In the 1970s the Bayswater Boys' Home was staffed by a paedophile ring, and staff not only sexually abused the children in their care but also allowed other paedophiles free access to boys, who were removed from the home and sexually abused at will.'' One such was John Bayer, who was jailed for nine years in 2008 for abusing 12 victims, five of them from the Bayswater home. In 2006, the Salvation Army secretly paid more than $1.5 million in compensation to more than 50 victims who were beaten, raped and tortured from the 1950s to 1970s by Salvation Army officers at the Bayswater home, Box Hill Boys' Home and East Kew Girls' Home, all now closed. CLAN spokesman Frank Golding said the processes of dealing with child abuse had ''not improved at all'' in the past 100 years. He said the responses of institutions over thousands of cases followed a similar pattern. This was disbelief (''you can't take the word of a child over the word of an adult''), denial, blaming the victim (''the girl was wicked and used her seductive charms against the priest'') and blaming the parents (''the children come from immoral families, what else could you expect?''). Law Institute of Victoria president Michael Holcroft told the inquiry that under present Victorian law, there was no obligation to report suspicions of child abuse to police. The mandatory reporting required of some professionals was to the Department of Human Services. He said failure to report reasonable suspicion to police should be a separate offence under the Crimes Act. http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/paedophile-ring-lent-out-boys-20121217-2bjej.html

"Child abuser dies at train station" (28-7-2013) A man who collapsed and died on the platform of Wacol train station yesterday has been confirmed s convicted serial pedophile Keith Albert Beattie. Recently released from prison after serving a 10-year sentence, the 68-year-old suffered a suspected heart attack before falling to the ground about 10.50am. Queensland Rail employees tried desperately to resuscitate the man as he lay lifeless. Paramedics rushed to the scene and picked up where the QR workers left off  but were unsuccessful. Beattie was pronounced dead at 11.40am. Police confirmed the death was not being treated as suspicious. Other media reports stated Beattie had ridden a bicycle to the train station from his nearby contingency accommodation. The contingency accommodation is on fenced-off Correctional Service land at Wacol, designated for convicted child sex offenders on supervision orders who are unable to find suitable housing. Beattie had a disturbing history of sexual abuse of children and intellectually impaired people. Between 1984 and 1997 he was convicted of 14 offences, committed across Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. His most recent offences involved maintaining an unlawful relationship with a child under 16, indecent dealing, unlawful carnal knowledge of an intellectually impaired person and indecent dealing with an intellectually impaired person. He was sentenced to 10 years, four months and four days jail for the offences but in 2006 was ordered to remain in prison indefinitely on the grounds that he remained a serious risk to the community. A review of that decision, on April 17 last year, found Beattie was still a serious risk to the community and it was again ordered that he be detained in custody for an indefinite period. Beattie was released on June 17 this year, but was subject to a supervision order that involved electronic monitoring and a curfew. A report is being prepared for the Coroner. http://www.qt.com.au/news/keith-albert-beattie-pedophile-dies-wacol/594123/

Homeless rapist tells bashed victim you're mine' before getting keys to her house and sneaking in- (21-8-2012) A HOMELESS man who bashed and raped a woman before effectively moving into her home and terrorising her for three months has appeared in court. Rodney Beckett, 57, met his female victim at a Melbourne pokies venue weeks before the attack that saw her kept hostage in her own home. Beckett faced the County Court today charged with two counts of rape, assault, stalking and false imprisonment. He has pleaded guilty to all charges. The court heard Beckett met his victim, who cannot be named, at a Melbourne pokies venue about six weeks before he confronted her at her Prahran home in early September 2010. While the victim opened her front door after returning home from work, Beckett pushed her inside and followed behind her, it was alleged. Once inside Beckett threatened the woman telling her he had been in prison for killing people before taking personal belongings from her including her mobile phone. After four hours Beckett told his victim to go to the bedroom where he raped her. He then showered and raped her again telling the woman youre mine now. The court heard the woman was kicked, grabbed by the hair and dragged, and punched during the night. The following morning Beckett again hit the woman in the face after she refused his request to move in with her. The court heard in the months following the attack Beckett regularly forced himself into the flat and obtained a set of keys to allow himself to enter at will. Beckett allegedly told his victim he would harm her and her nephew and threatened to burn her house down if she went to the police. Janine Garner, for Beckett, said her client had had a rough upbringing and was homeless at the time of the offence. She said he had been living at the Royal Botanic Gardens and sleeping in a public toilet and had believed he had been in a consensual relationship with the woman. But Judge Liz Gaynor said Beckett had demonstrated an appalling pattern of behaviour toward his victim who he had terrorised for three months. Whether he thinks hes in a relationship or not does in no way entitle him to treat her in that way, she said. Its very interesting that he thinks if theyre in a relationship hes got the right to rape her and physically assault her. Being in a relationship doesnt entitle you to invade your partners home. Beckett was remanded until a later date. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/homeless-rapist-tells-bashed-victim-youre-mine-before-getting-keys-to-her-house-and-sneaking-in/story-e6frf7jo-1226454940730

Jailed in 1991 for 6 rapes, indecent assault and 4 counts of defilement of a young girl. 6 months after being paroled in 1998, he committed sex offences against children aged 3 and 16. News (26-3-2012)- "Worst criminals able to reoffend" Some of Tasmania's worst criminals are reoffending after the court refuses to declare them dangerous criminals a classification that gives judges the power to jail them indefinitely. There are seven declared dangerous criminals in Tasmania, being mostly child abusers and serial rapists. Beyond Abuse spokesman Steve Fisher said it appeared either the Director of Public Prosecutions was not making enough dangerous prisoner applications to the court or the court was rejecting too many. The Supreme Court in 2003 refused a prosecution application to declare child sex abuser Anthony John Minney, of Launceston, a dangerous criminal, yet he was jailed last September for 14 months after pleading guilty to loitering near children. Minney has a long history of sexually assaulting children and last year asked police to send him to prison. In 2003 Justice Ewan Crawford said Minney's child sex abuse case was ``not sufficiently exceptional'' to justify making a dangerous criminal order. "Seven people (declared dangerous) across the whole of Tasmania does not seem to indicate they are using the tool at their disposal enough, '' Mr Fisher said. "The dangerous criminal register was brought in to serve a purpose and that's to do exactly that to keep them off the street.'' Late last year convicted serial rapist Kevin Richard Bell failed in his bid to have his dangerous criminal order overturned. Bell was sentenced to 12 years' jail in 1991 for six rapes, one indecent assault and four counts of defilement of a young girl. Six months after being paroled in 1998, he committed sex offences against children aged three and 16. Rocherlea man Brendan James Freeman was declared a dangerous criminal in 2004 and sentenced to seven years' jail after admitting to raping and bashing a woman in Launceston. Colin John Sparkes (1997) was also placed on the list after being convicted of burglary with intent to rape. Other criminals the DPP has applied to have placed on the dangerous criminal register include Ian John Brumby (2002) who had committed assault, robbery and rape, and serial rapist Paul Vincent Phillips (1998).http://www.theadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/worst-criminals-able-to-reoffend/2500119.aspx News (29-11-2011)- "Rapist remains 'dangerous'" http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-29/20112911-/3700994

TREVOR JAMES BENJAMIN (QLD- Cairns)|28 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 29-11-2011, in the Townsville District Court, to 11 yrs jail.|Trevor Benjamin/ The "Riverway Rapist" - pleaded guilty to rape. Stalked his victim, (a 19-year-old girl) for about 30 minutes before bashing and raping her on a jogging track near Vickers Bridge/ Townsville, in February 15, 2010. Repeat Offender - has a history of violent sexual offences against women. News- "Brutal rapist stalked victim on Riverway"- THE "Riverway Rapist" was caught after he had a bizarre conversation about the sex attack with a taxi driver and was the brunt of workmates' jokes because he resembled the sex attacker's comfit. Cairns paver Trevor James Benjamin, who has a history of violent sexual offences against women, was working at Lavarack Barracks when he randomly picked a 19-year-old Townsville girl to brutally attack sexually. Chilling details of the violent sex crime - on February 15, 2010 near Vickers Bridge - emerged at the 26-year-old's sentencing yesterday in the Townsville District Court. Crown prosecutor Michael Cowen, who said the girl's random rape was one of the most fearful and chilling crimes in the community, revealed the teenager asked, "Why me?", and Benjamin replied "Because you are the only one out here".http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2011/11/29/287091_news.html News (1-6-2012)- "'Riverway Rapist' may get sentence reduction" The "Riverway Rapist" may have his 11-year jail sentence reduced because his victim could not explain the "violent" injuries she received, as he had knocked her unconscious before sexually assaulting her. Trevor James Benjamin pleaded guilty in November last year to the 2010 rape - called "chilling" and "fearful" by prosecution - after he king-hit her as she jogged past. But the 28-year-old yesterday appealed for a reduced sentence of nine years, saying too much emphasis was placed on the girl's injuries. His defence lawyer Rob East told the Townsville Supreme Court the violent injuries could only be assumed. "The (victim) was not able to particularise any violence that occurred to her during and after the rape," Mr East said. "It was left to looking at photos and taking inference. "The photos showed more injuries than just being king-hit and inference was drawn (by Judge Stuart Durward SC) that they were gratuitous." Benjamin, a former paver from Cairns, stalked his victim for about 30 minutes before raping her on February 15, 2010. The girl was left bloodied, bruised and unconscious alongside the running track after the rape, and was found by another jogger. When the teen asked her attacker "why me?" he responded "because you're the only one out here". Mr East argued her injuries may have been rendered when she was knocked unconscious and fell, and said the rapist's sentence was "outside the appropriate range". Crown prosecutor David Jones argued otherwise, and said Judge Durward SC was correct in labelling the injuries gratuitous. "The photos show multiple blows and contusions which indicate the complainant was dealt with very roughly," he said. Court of Appeal president Justice Margaret McMurdo AC asked how the victim could give evidence if she had been knocked out. "It appears she drifted in and out of consciousness," Mr Jones said. Justices McMurdo AC, David North SC and Jim Henry reserved their decision on Benjamin's appeal. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2012/06/01/334635_news.html News (30-11-2011)- "Riverway Rapist" Trevor James Benjamin deserves his 11-year jail sentence and everything that happens to him as a result. The community is cheering loud and long after he was sentenced yesterday for stalking, bashing and raping a 19-year-old girl in February, 2010. This young girl, full of hopes and dreams and making her way in the world, went out for an evening jog and her life changed forever. It's hard to imagine the pain, terror and gut-wrenching disgust she must have felt as Trevor James Benjamin crept up behind her, punched her in the face and committed this awful crime. This case presents a number of grave concerns that everyone in society must consider. Firstly, what happened in Trevor James Benjamin's life to make him want to lurk in a public place searching for a victim to rape? At what point growing up at home and in his interactions with other people did he decide rape was an option? This wasn't some drunken escapade which went further than it should have, this man left his accommodation that fateful night with the intent of raping someone. It's a scary thought that people like this walk among us. Secondly, he was only caught by pure luck and smart police work because someone decided to tell police about a random, but odd, conversation. Some time after the attack, this grub decided to jump out of a cab without paying the fare and this is the sole reason police arrested him and set off the chain of events that led to the rape charge. As part of the police investigations, the cab driver told them Trevor James Benjamin was talking about the rape of a girl in Townsville and this raised the cops' suspicions. When you think Trevor James Benjamin's workmates were ribbing him about looking like a police comfit of the rapist, it's easy to see that everyone has a responsibility to fight crime. If you hear something or have the slightest suspicion - no matter how seemingly insignificant - tell the police, and gutless scum like Trevor James Benjamin will be caught and punished. Need for dedicated judge- THE calls for a dedicated Family Court judge to be based in Townsville are justified. Justice Robert Monteith is retiring from the court after 11 years of service but his replacement has not been named. There are fears the Federal Government will just fly a judge to town as needed but this is unacceptable. Townsville is the second-largest regional centre in Queensland and continues to grow at a rapid rate. If anywhere needs a fully functional Family Court, our city is surely it. Yet it looks like our southern political masters are shortchanging the North yet again. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2011/11/30/287451_opinion.html

News (2-5-2007)- "Sex predator walks free" A depressed and lonely woman who had sex with a 15-year-old boy in a "foolish lapse" has been given a 12-month suspended sentence. Diana Nicole Bennett, 30, was flattered that a boy of 15 found her sexually attractive. The County Court heard that the boy rang her one morning in 2005 while she was drunk. The pair met and they had sex. The court heard that the boy had previously called Bennett, but she had declined to accept his invitations to meet with him. Today Judge Lance Pilgrim said Bennett was remorseful. Bennett, of Melton, told police she had a significant alcohol problem and would buy three bottles of vodka a week, drinking them straight and on her own. She had drunk a bottle of vodka the night before she had sex with the boy. The court heard that the boy did not make a victim impact statement, but he is now rude to her. Judge Pilgrim said he was satisfied Bennett's offending was a foolish lapse and since the offence had taken steps to rehabilitate herself. Forensic psychologist Ian Joblin gave evidence to the court that Bennett's offending did not represent a psycho-sexual disorder but symptoms of a personality disorder. She requires mental health attention, the court heard. Judge Pilgrim place Bennett on the sex offender register. She will have to report to authorities for 15 years. Her jail term is suspended for 18 months. Bennett pleaded guilty to one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/sex-predator-walks-free/story-e6frf7kx-1111113454629

Ronald Bentley, 44, of Moran St, Norlane, pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates' Court on Monday to knowingly possessing child pornography. Police prosecutor Leading Senior Constable Alana Jackson said police searched Bentley's home on August 30 last year, seizing computers, external hard drives and a number of USB thumb drives. "Forensic analysis revealed a Western digital hard-drive contained 944 images, 387 of which were naked children," she said. "A further 376 images were of comics/drawings of children engaged in sexual activity. Sen-Constable Jackson said 73 images involved sexual violence. "A total of 168 movie files were located," she said. Sen-Constable Jackson said two USB thumb drives contained a total of 35 images and 13 movie files of child pornography. Adrian Paull, for Bentley, said his client received an email in 2008 with some child pornography attached. "He became fixated, trapped in a cycle of downloading child pornography," Mr Paull said. The lawyer said his client was bullied at school, had difficulty showing his feelings and had since sought psychological assistance. Mr Paull said Bentley, who runs a professional website known as The Beauty Academy, was also in the process of trying to start up a bakery in Geelong. "Since his arrest, he has also been financially supporting Open Arms Cambodia, a charity formed to assist children who have been sexually abused," he said.

Her current whereabouts are unknown. Corrective Services Commissioner Ron Woodham has ordered that a warrant be issued for Betham's arrest.

STEPHEN VAN BEVEREN (VIC- Geelong)|29 yrs old (2011)|To be updated.|Found guilty of indecent assault and stalking in the Geelong Magistrates Court, 8-3-2011. News (9-3-2011)- "Rape threat terror plea"- A young woman has told of a terrifying experience during which she was indecently assaulted and repeatedly threatened with rape while walking to work last month. "I was really scared, the man was acting erratically and I thought if I just kept walking and didn't say anything, he would go away," she told a Geelong court yesterday. "I was just walking to work and I thought I was going to be raped." Stephen Van Beveren, 29, of no fixed address, pleaded not guilty in Geelong Magistrates' Court yesterday to charges of indecent assault and stalking. The victim said she was walking along Boundary Rd, Newcomb, about 8.15am on February 8, this year when she heard a man yelling and screaming on the other side of the road. "When he saw me looking at him, he crossed the road and began following me," she said. "He told me I should walk faster because he was going to rape me." The woman said Van Beveren continued to follow closely behind, at one point telling her to "run as fast as you can because I am going to rape you". She said she pulled away when she felt him pull on her jacket and Van Beveren repeated his threat of rape. During his record of interview, Van Beveren admitted walking up Boundary Rd but denied going near the woman or indecently assault her. He claimed the words he was yelling were part of a rap song he had made up. Magistrate Ann McGarvie said she accepted the victim's evidence and found both charges proved.

HENRY EDWARD BEWART (Henry Bewart/ Bewert) ( QLD - Ipswich..Wacol precinct - 2013)|48 yrs old (2013)|Sentence to be updated..Bewart was given an indefinite sentence in 2011 under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act. "Serial sexual offender to be released" (9-4-2013) Justice Philip McMurdo said, in Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday, that the 48-year-old remained a serious danger to the community but his risk of re-offending could be managed with a strict supervision order. He rescinded the indefinite detention order and released Bewart to the Wacol precinct with a condition he notify corrective services officers if he is ever attending a hospital or emergency department. Bewart must also comply with curfew restrictions, abstain from alcohol and illicit drugs, submit to random urinalysis and breath testing and must not visit licensed venues without permission.

"Serial sexual offender to be released" (9-4-2013) A sexual deviant who violently attacked his doctor and two nurses at separate Ipswich health centres is deemed suitable to return to the community. Henry Edward Bewart, who has a history of indecent exposure and rubbing himself against strangers since 1982 at age 17, was given an indefinite sentence in 2011 under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act. Justice Philip McMurdo said, in Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday, that the 48-year-old remained a serious danger to the community but his risk of re-offending could be managed with a strict supervision order. He rescinded the indefinite detention order and released Bewart to the Wacol precinct with a condition he notify corrective services officers if he is ever attending a hospital or emergency department. Bewart must also comply with curfew restrictions, abstain from alcohol and illicit drugs, submit to random urinalysis and breath testing and must not visit licensed venues without permission. He must submit to any medical testing and mental health treatment, principally from the Richmond Fellowship Queensland organisation which has agreed to help Bewart. Justice McMurdo said psychiatric reports from Professor Joan Lawrence and Dr Michael Beech in September and October last year found Bewart should not be released. But Mr McMurdo said treating doctor Evelyn Timmins had since developed a management plan with Bewart and the fellowship that satisfied all doctors a supervised release was possible. He said Dr Timmins reported Bewart's mental state had stabilised and Dr Beech agreed release into supported accommodation with case management from district mental health services as proposed could work. "Each of Professor Lawrence and Dr Beech have revised their opinion such that it also would support an order for the prisoner's release," he said. "Last Thursday, Professor Lawrence wrote .... 'overall I believe that the arrangements that have been established are very appropriate for Mr Bewart's needs and if he complies with these and contributes his own energies to helping himself and complies with all that is requirements, it is my opinion that the risk he presents to the community, his anti-social, including sexual, behaviours will be managed by a supervision order'." Psychiatrists have diagnosed Bewart with sexual deviance and paraphilia, particularly exhibitionism, indecent exposure and frottage - the desire to rub sexually against other people. He also has a personality disorder, with narcissistic and possibly psychopathic traits, and has issues with degradation of women, seeing them purely as sexual objects for his satisfaction. .

Michael Binns, 51, downloaded the images between May 17, 2007, and November 15, 2008. Sentencing him at the Supreme Court in Launceston today, Chief Justice Ewan Crawford referred to his conviction in 1999 on three sexual assault and indecent assault convictions relating to the abuse of two 11-year-old girls. "The present offences demonstrate that his sexual proclivity for young girls remains and that a sentence of personal deterrence is required,'' Justice Crawford said. Justice Crawford said while 394 of the images were classed at the lowest end of the scale for child exploitation material, most were still very sexually explicit. The photographs featured about 300 girls aged between three and 15. "The girls in the images are to be regarded as victims of the accused and his kind,'' he said. Binns will serve three months' imprisonment for using a carriage service for child pornography material and a further six months for possessing child exploitation material. His name will be placed on the child sex offender registry for five years. http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/general/child-molester-jailed-for-porn-images/2357643.aspx

Blackall pleaded guilty to six counts of indecent assault which related to two male victims, who he knew in a teacher-student relationship.

A further offence against the same boy occurred in 1984. The second victim was indecently touched in 1982. During the year (the boy) would be sent out of English for unruly behaviour and would see the prisoner as he was the English master, a tendered facts sheet said.

Victim was a 15 yr old girl. Boehmke told the girl after indecently assaulting her that: "I swear to Christ if you tell anyone about this I'll come back and slit your throat." News (26-7-2011)- "Sentence cut for child sex offender after 'vigilante' attacks" A child sex offender has had his jail term cut after a court took into account the trauma he suffered from 'vigilante' attacks from his victim's family. Michael John Boehmke, 31, was to spend 12 months in jail after pleading guilty in April this year to five counts of indecent treatment of a 15-year-old girl in her own home. Boehmke is now free after that time was cut to about eight months by the Court of Appeal. Court of Appeal president Justice Margaret McMurdo said the young girl's family needed to understand Boehmke's time in jail would have been longer but for their retribution antics. The court heard Boehmke, 31, was bashed by the girl's brother who left him with facial injuries, a fractured rib and collapsed lung. He was hospitalised for four days and had health problems for weeks stemming from the assault. On another occasion, the girl's family made death threats against him and smashed his car window with a baseball bat. "The fact that an offender has suffered extra-curial punishment will not necessarily result in a significantly reduced sentence ... but nor can this court ignore the detriment the applicant suffered at the hands of the complainant's family acting as vigilantes," Justice McMurdo said in a judgment published today. "I emphasise that our community does not tolerate vigilantism. The complainant's family must understand that the applicant's sentence would have been longer but for their anti-social retributive behaviour," Justice McMurdo said. The court heard Boehmke, who was known to the girl's mother, had been staying the night at the girl's family home in October 2010. First, he inappropriately touched the girl on a couch. When others retired to bed, he entered her room and tried to kiss her despite her telling him to get out of her room. He left then returned a short time later and exposed himself to her and held her down while he performed oral sex on her. He told the girl: "I swear to Christ if you tell anyone about this I'll come back and slit your throat." The girl told her brother the next morning and he bashed Boehmke, accusing him of raping his sister. Boehmke told police he had mixed alcohol with prescribed drugs and could not remember the incident in the girl's room. In April this year he pleaded guilty to five counts of indecent treatment of a child under 16 and stealing $10 from her room. He was sentenced to three years' jail to serve 12 months before being eligible for parole. He was also placed on two years' probation. But he appealed, arguing the sentence was manifestly excessive. In a unanimous decision, Court of Appeal judges sentenced him to 12 months' jail suspended after he had served about eight months. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/sentence-cut-for-child-sex-offender-after-vigilante-attacks-20110726-1hy6y.html#ixzz1wvzUnkSV

Andrew Bowen, 20, of Greensborough, pleaded guilty in the Victorian County Court today to three counts of rape and one each of stalking, unlawful imprisonment and theft. Prosecutor Daryl Brown said Bowen broke into the 21-year-old woman's home in Melbourne's north-eastern suburb of Eltham North in the early hours of March 17. Wearing a dark balaclava, dark clothing and latex gloves, he awoke the victim, who was home alone, tied her up and raped her. Mr Brown said Bowen confessed to police in May and admitted unscrewing the handle on the victim's bedroom door and stealing her mobile phone to prevent her immediately getting help and enable his escape. During a search of his home, police allegedly found images on his computer of women being sexually attacked by men in balaclavas. They also discovered he had visited websites depicting rape images and an article on how to avoid leaving physical evidence during attacks. At the beginning of today's hearing the victim lashed out at her alleged attacker in court, crying "bastard" and "I hope you feel proud" as Bowen stood in the dock. The woman's supporters stared fixedly at Bowen as he entered his guilty pleas. The maximum penalty for rape is 25 years jail.

The victim's supporters stared fixedly at 20-year-old Andrew Bowen as he entered his guilty plea at the Victorian County Court. Obsessed with sexual fantasies, Bowen broke into the woman's house, tied her up and raped her in the early hours of March 17 this year, the court was told. Bowen, of Greensborough, pleaded guilty to three counts of rape and one each of stalking, unlawful imprisonment and theft. Prosecutor Daryl Brown said Bowen broke into the 21-year-old woman's home in Melbourne's north-eastern suburb of Eltham North. Wearing a balaclava and latex gloves, he woke the victim, who was home alone, tied her up and raped her a number of times. Mr Brown said Bowen confessed to police in May and they allegedly found images on his computer of women being sexually attacked by men in balaclavas. He had also visited websites depicting rape scenes and had an article on avoiding detection after attacks. The court heard the victim and her family were too traumatised to return home after the attack. In a statement, the victim said she suffered nightmares, anxiety and could not sleep for more than two hours at a time. "The terror was indescribable," she said. "My security and trust are completely destroyed. I don't know if I'll ever feel safe again." She said she was scared of the dark, could not be alone and distrusted men. After being told he was a suspect, Bowen arranged a one-way ticket to Sydney the next morning, the court heard. He then attended Greensborough police station where he was abusive to officers who subdued him with capsicum spray before he eventually confessed. Bowen's lawyer Julie Sutherland said he was "riddled with remorse" and deserved credit for his frank confession when the case against him was weak. Ms Sutherland said Bowen was socially withdrawn, felt socially inadequate and had began fantasising about the victim being his girlfriend, knowing it would be a "mission impossible". "What happened on that evening was almost part of a fantasy that had been brewing in his mind," she said. Ms Sutherland said Bowen felt suicidal on the night of the attack and told the victim: "It's the drugs that make me do it". Forensic psychologist Jeffrey Cummins gave evidence Bowen became preoccupied with sexual fantasies and this, along with his drug and alcohol use and depression, led to the attack. Bowen smoked cannabis heavily through his teenage years and last year also began using amphetamines and alertness pills, the court heard. Mr Cummins said Bowen became addicted to pornography at 14 and later began viewing more extreme themes. "He's quite a disturbed young man," he said. He said he would require long term treatment to be rehabilitated. Judge Damian Murphy will sentence Bowen next Thursday. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/rapist-stored-attack-images-on-computer/story-e6frf7jo-1111115107116
DAVID ALAN BOWEN  (VIC - Greensborough)|66 yrs old (2010) |Sentenced in April 2007 to 2 yrs and 8 months jail - 21 months non parole. Sentenced again in April 2011 to 2yrs jail/ sentence suspended for 3yrs.|David Bowen - Former Doctor. Pleaded guilty in 2007 to 11 counts of indecent assault, 7 counts of gross indecency. Offences occurred between 1960's- 1970-2. Victims were boys (aged 12 and 14 yrs). Pleaded guilty again in 2011 - 5 counts of indecent assault. Victims were 2 boys. "Victims forced to wait for compensation from Eltham sex offender" (1-3-2008) A child sex abuse victim who waited 30 years for justice must now wait for compensation. The County Court has ordered former Eltham doctor and convicted pedophile David Alan Bowen to pay $210,000 in compensation to his two victims. Among the highest awards for compensation under the Sentencing Act in Victorian history, it came a day after the Court of Appeal cut the 64-year-olds sentence by four months. But the victims will now have to apply to the Department of Justice to request that property seized after Bowen was sentenced last year be used for the pay-out. Property and shares worth more than $1 million were seized last March. In court on Friday, February 29, Bowen was accused of hiding assets to avoid paying compensation. Bowen had told the court he was barely solvent and could only hand over $20,000. But Judge James Duggan said he did not believe Bowen, a well-established GP with no family to support. When one looks at the history of recent transactions, it seems to me that the likely explanation for his current position is that he attempted to place his assets beyond reach to the extent that he can, he said. .

South Grafton man Travis Braam, 21 and Clarenza man Andrew Mark Stewart, 24, were sentenced for their part in a brutal Bent St home raid in November 2010. In November last year a Grafton Court heard how the two men pleaded guilty to two home invasions in nine days, one in which a woman was raped and a man had his finger dislocated.

WADE BENJAMIN BREARLEY (QLD- Brisbane)|yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 5 months jail in 2011.|Wade Benjamin Brearley- Convicted of possessing child pornography and "upskirting" a work colleage...Registered Queensland Nurse- In July 2012, the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal banned Brearley from re-registering as a nurse for 3 yrs. News (10-8-2012)- "Nurse banned for child porn and upskirting" A registered nurse has been banned from the profession for three years after being convicted of possessing child pornography in the worst category and upskirting a work colleague. Queensland nurse Wade Benjamin Brearley was jailed for five months last year after admitting to accessing child exploitation material, between August 2008 and October 2009, and taking photos up the skirt of a female colleague while on duty. Despite having been released on parole, the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal banned Brearly late last month from re-registering as a nurse for three years and ordered he undergo counselling by a clinical psychologist approved by the Nursing & Midwifery Board of Australia for at least 12 months. In her judgment, QCAT deputy president, Fleur Kingham, noted Brearley had taken steps to preserve the child exploitation material on portable memory devices over the 14-month period. "Some of the images were of the most serious categories, depicting penetration, sadism or bestiality," she said. "It is also concerning that Mr Brearley brought his sexual offending into the workplace. "The upskirting offence indicated a willingness to play a more active part than he had previously played in securing pornographic material." Ms Kingham said she was satisfied the tribunals sanctions on Brearley would ensure he was a minimal risk to his colleagues and the public in the future. "The purpose of the counselling is to facilitate Mr Brearley developing insight into why he engaged in the conduct the subject of these proceedings and to develop strategies to prevent the reoccurrence of such conduct," she said. If he does return to nursing Brearly will be barred from accessing any file, whether electronic or hard copy, of any client or patient under the age of 18, unless he is under the supervision of another registered nurse at the time. He will also be banned from using any form of computer with internet access at his workplace, unless under direct supervision. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/nurse-banned-for-child-porn-and-upskirting-20120810-23yio.html

NSW- News (16-7-2008)- "No jail on child porn offences"- A Lake Macquarie man appearing in Newcastle Local Court yesterday on four child pornography offences was placed on a two-year good behaviour bond. Evan John Breedon, 36, driver, of Windermere Park, was also fined a total of $2000 on two charges of possessing child pornography and two of using the Internet to access child pornography. Sentencing Breedon, magistrate Michael Morahan said the offences would normally call for jail but noted that police had said they were at the lower end of the seriousness scale. A police statement before the court said authorities were initially tipped off by Dutch police, who picked up Breedon in May 2006 using an Internet bulletin board associated with child pornography. Breedon had downloaded 400 photos featuring nude pre-pubescent girls, the statement said. In January this year police executed a search warrant on his home and seized computer equipment. Breedon had completed a Salvation Army lifestyle program.
PETER CHARLES BRENNAN (VIC- Ballarat)|66 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 25-6-2009, in the Ballarat County Court, to 10.5 yrs jail- 7 yrs non-parole.|Peter Brennan was found guilty by a jury in March, 2009, of 16 counts of indecent assault and 2 counts of rape. Former masseur. Victims were 10 women. Offences occured between November 2006 and August 2007, when he was working as a masseur at Serenity and Tranquility Health Care and Day Spa in Ballarat. News (26-6-2009) - A former Ballarat masseur was yesterday jailed for 10-and-a-half years for sexually assaulting his clients. Peter Charles Brennan, 63, was found guilty by a jury in March of 16 counts of indecent assault and two counts of rape. During the trial the County Court in Ballarat heard Brennan touched 10 women on the breast and vagina during massages at Serenity and Tranquility Health Care and Day Spa between November 2006 and August 2007. One of his victims, a pregnant woman, feared for the safety of her unborn child as a result of Brennan's actions, the court heard. "I felt part of me was stolen that day," she said in a victim impact statement. Brennan also massaged a victim's chest, saying it was helpful for treatment of her asthma. In sentencing, Judge Les Ross said given Brennan's offending over the 10-month period, it was only appropriate he be punished with a significant jail term. He said the victims suffered relationship issues, nightmares and social difficulties. "It is beyond question that in various ways your conduct adversely affected the lives of your victims," he said. Judge Ross ordered Brennan serve seven years before being eligible for parole. Outside court, victims were visibly emotional and relieved to have closure. One woman said she felt the sentence was reasonable and "justice has been served". The woman said she knew of at least four other women who had not reported their experiences, but believed it was important to speak out because "he did the wrong thing". "I wished they (other victims) had come forward, but perhaps they are in denial," she said. Another woman said she felt sorry for everyone Brennan had assaulted. "I was shocked, hearing it read out again, that he used the same tactics (on other victims), the same stories ... that he thought it was alright," she said. "It gives me closure." In a statement, Brennan's former employer Jennifer said she had been impacted in many ways by what happened. "I feel abused and conned and angry at myself that I did not see him for what he was," she said. http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/former-ballarat-masseur-jailed-for-10-years-for-sexual-assaulting-clients/1551503.aspx|/images/peter_brennan_2.jpg

FORMER teacher at Beverley District High School, and WA pony club president. News (29-11-2010)- "Child porn offender teacher avoids jail"- A former teacher and West Australian pony club president has avoided jail after being found guilty of viewing child pornography online. Murray William Britza, 63, of Beverley, 130km east of Perth, was sentenced today on five counts of accessing child porn websites between November 2008 and June 2009. In the District Court in Perth, Judge Philip McCann sentenced Britza to two 12-month terms of imprisonment, to be suspended immediately, and placed him on an 18-month good behaviour bond. On the three other counts he fined Britza a total of $12,000. The judge said the offending was not of the most serious kind and Britza had not downloaded or saved any of the material he viewed. But he criticised the former teacher for "living a lie in maintaining his innocence" and deluding himself in maintaining he was the victim of a "computer gremlin". WA's Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) gathered evidence against Britza by obtaining warrants to install hidden listening devices and a camera, then searching his house in July 2009, seizing a modem and computer. Judge McCann said some of the boys depicted engaging in sexual acts in the images found on the computer were under the age of 16 but in other cases it was hard to ascertain whether the youths were under-aged. He said Britza was of "impeccable character save for these offences" and the high reputation he had achieved in the community had been ruined by his offending. Until earlier this year, Britza was president of the Pony Club Association of Western Australia. Judge McCann said his ability to contribute to the community further, including his work with disabled riders, was now lost. He concluded that Britza had been stressed by degenerative medical conditions and had suffered an undiagnosed depressive illness that led him to act out of character and with poor judgment. Outside court, CCC investigations manager Trevor Wynn said the sentencing was a message to offenders that law enforcement agencies were determined to find them and bring them to the courts for viewing child pornography. "Each one of those images indicates a time when a child, a defenceless child was engaged in some activity of which they had no say about," he said. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/child-porn-offender-teacher-avoids-jail/story-e6frfku0-1225962922063#ixzz1v78Tz3qg http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/newshome/8155465/teacher-convicted-of-child-porn-charges/

At 5am, he got out of the woman's bed and told her he was going to the toilet. Instead, he went into her daughter's bedroom. The girl was registered with the Parole Board as a victim. "The board notes that the applicant's crimes have had and are likely to have a long-term significant effect on his victim," the board said. Notes from the board reveal the man was housed at the Launceston Reception Prison during his time in jail. "The applicant declined participation in the New Directions (Sex Offenders) Program as he wished to remain in Launceston to maintain contact with his family, particularly with his wife and children," the board said. There is no program available in the Launceston Reception Prison for sex offenders. However, the board said a Sex Offenders Risk Assessment found long-term risk of Mr Brooks reoffending was in the low range. It said he would attend a psychological treatment plan aimed at addressing his sexual offending. The board also said alcohol was a factor in the offending. The applicant had no record of prior offending and he had not had any internal offences recorded during his time in prison. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/04/05/315831_most-popular-stories.html News (7-4-2012)- http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/04/07/316331_tasmania-news.html News (5-8-2010)- http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/crime-and-law/3-years-jail-for-child-rape/1904662.aspx
TREVOR JOHN BROOKS (SA)|47yrs old (2013) |Sentenced on the 19-12-2003 to 27 yrs jail/ 23 yrs non parole/ Pleaded guilty in October 2003 to 7 counts of rape/ 2 counts of attempted rape. |Convicted on DNA evidence, along with his partner in some of the crimes James Trevor Birmingham. Victims were women.  "Soul Ripped Apart By Serial Rapist" (4-12-2003) A victim of a masked serial rapist who plagued the northern suburbs for five years took her own life because he had "ripped apart her soul", the District Court has heard. The woman, who was recovering from open-heart surgery at the time, killed herself a year after she was attacked by Trevor John Brooks of Salisbury North. She was one of four women Brooks, 37, raped between 1995 and 2000, each time naked except for a mask. All of his victims were home alone. A fifth woman saved herself by fighting back with a pair of scissors and a bat. One victim, then aged 21, was raped by Brooks and another man, James Trevor Birmingham. Yesterday, she told the court she had spent seven years "haunted" by the memory of the duo standing in her bedroom wearing "Ku Klux Klan masks". In October, Brooks pleaded guilty to seven counts of rape and two of attempted rape. He was arrested after his carelessness allowed a sample of his DNA to be collected and traced. Birmingham, 43, joined Brooks in assaulting a 21-year-old woman at Salisbury North in March 1997, just five months before he was jailed for killing a man in a road smash. Yesterday, Judge David Smith heard victim impact statements, including a poem by the woman who committed suicide. In October 2000, Brooks raped her in an Elizabeth motel room until police arrived, scaring him off. In the process he left behind a sock from which his DNA profile was obtained. Twelve months later, just before she and her husband were due to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary, the woman committed suicide, having endured a long battle with her memories of the incident. "Terror, indescribable pain, my soul has been ripped apart; Tears fall like acid rain while blood drains from my heart," the poem reads. "The faceless shadow, rancid smell- mine forever more; His voice will haunt me till he rests in hell, his power too great to ignore". Throughout two hours of victim impact statements, Brooks sat hunched in the dock, avoiding harsh stares from the packed gallery. But he looked up, seemingly in shock, when confronted by his first victim, a woman known as 'Hayley'. Hayley was raped in her Elizabeth Park home in January 1995 while her husband and two sons were away on a fishing trip. "I needed to hear the word 'guilty' come out of your mouth, Mr Brooks," she said. "I do not want revenge, I want you to hear me say this: I may always be affected by your actions, but I'm free. "You, Mr Brooks, are not free." Judge Smith remanded both men for further submissions tomorrow. www.adelaidenow.com.au

ALWYN WAYNE BROWN (WA - Perth/ Melville)|40 yrs old (2012)|Paedophile/ Repeat Offender. Jailed indefinitely in 2010 because of an "unacceptable risk" he would commit a "serious sexual offence" if set free has been released into the community under a strict eight-year supervision order.below.|Alwyn Wayne Brown - Paedophile/ Repeat Offender - Brown was jailed in 1999 for luring a six-year-old girl from a Broome hostel and attempting to sexually penetrate her. He was released in July 2003 but was returned to jail in December that year for sexually abusing a 10-year-old girl in Morley, an offence for which he received a 4 year jail term. In 2007, DNA evidence linked him to a November 2003 sex assault of two girls aged eight and 12 years old. Brown took the sisters into a storeroom of a unit under construction in Bedford before blocking the door so they could not leave and committed an indecent act. Two years were added to the prison time he was already serving. Between 1995 and 1997 he was convicted of a number of sexual assault offences in NSW. In November 1998 he was convicted of three counts of wilful and obscene exposure in public in Victoria -below. "Notorious sex offender released" (2-8-2012) A child sex offender who was jailed indefinitely in 2010 because of an "unacceptable risk" he would commit a "serious sexual offence" if set free has been released into the community under a strict eight-year supervision order. In a judgment handed down by Supreme Court Judge John McKechnie, Alwyn Wayne Brown was deemed to be a "serious danger to the community" but was released to live in Melville under strict conditions, including a daily curfew. Brown has spent most of the past 14 years in prison for a series of sexual attacks on girls aged six to 12. Brown will be required to live at a specified address in Melville and undergo libido-suppressing drug treatments and counselling. He was also ordered to have no contact with his victims or any child under the age of 16 years of age. The judgment noted Brown had made "significant progress" during counselling sessions towards "better understanding his offending behaviour". Brown had also voluntarily taken anti-libidinal medication to "manage his deviant sexual fantasies by diminishing sexual arousal". Following the introduction of the drug Androcur, Brown reported a decrease in sexual fantasies and blood tests had shown a decrease in the level of testosterone post medication, the judgment said. Brown's treating psychologist had pointed out that there were benefits for treating within the community as opposed to prison. .
ARTHUR RICHARD BROWN (QLD)|30 yrs old (2010)|Sentenced 3-8-2010, in the Toowoomba District Court, to 11 yrs jail - to serve 80% of the sentence.|Arthur Brown brutally raped and bashed a 61-year-old Toowoomba woman in her Centenary Heights home on the night of 28-4-2008. Brown was convicted of a similar incident in 2006. "Sadistic rapist loses appeal" (16-2-2011) Sadistic rapist Arthur Richard Brown has lost an appeal against his conviction and a chance for a new trial on the rape and bashing of a Toowoomba grandmother in her own home. Brown, 30, was sentenced to 11 years jail and declared a serious violent offender (meaning he has to serve 80 per cent of the term), after being found guilty by a Toowoomba District Court jury of raping the 61-year-old woman in her Centenary Heights home in April, 2008. Brown's Toowoomba trial in August last year heard his victim had been asleep in bed when he broke into her home late on the night of April 28, 2008.- http://www.thechronicle.com.au/story/2011/02/16/sadistic-rapist-loses-appeal-toowoomba/ "Arthur Richard Brown, 30, found guilty of raping Toowoomba grandmother seeks new trial" (2-2-2011) A man found guilty of brutally bashing and raping a Toowoomba grandmother wanted a new trial because his previous conviction for attacking a "mature-age woman" was allowed as evidence, a court heard today. In the Court of Appeal in Brisbane, barrister Paul Smith was making submissions on behalf of Arthur Richard Brown who is serving 11 years jail for the attack on a woman, aged 61, in April 2008. A jury took only three hours to find Brown, 30, guilty of rape, grievous bodily harm, burglary and stealing, after a trial in the District Court in Toowooma last year. The trial heard the woman was asleep in her bed when she awoke to find Brown punching her about the face. She suffered facial fractures, bruises and lacerations. The court heard the woman picked out three people, including Brown, from a police indentification board of 12 men. When police went to question Brown they found two pairs of women's underwear similar to those missing from the victim's home. The court heard Brown was convicted of a 2006 offence, also in Toowoomba, when a "mature age woman" opened her door to investigate a noise outside. Brown grabbed her and tried to pull her outside but the woman fended him off with her walking frame.- http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/arthur-richard-brown-found-guilty-of-raping-toowoomba-grandmother-seeks-new-trial/story-e6freoof-1225998725558 "Rapist showed no emotion" (4-8-2010) Convicted rapist Arthur Richard Brown had attacked and raped a Toowoomba grandmother in her own home just one week after being released from custody, Toowoomba District Court heard yesterday. Brown, 30, will remain behind bars for at least the next nine years after he was jailed yesterday for the brutal rape and bashing of the 61-year-old in her Centenary Heights home on the night of April 28, 2008. His victim watched from the public gallery of Court Number One as Brown was sentenced to 11 years jail and declared a serious violent offender, meaning he will have to serve at least 80% of the term. Judge Clive Wall QC explained that he would ordinarily have jailed Brown for 13 years, but for the fact he had already served almost two years in custody prior to sentence. You have displayed no remorse whatsoever, Judge Wall told Brown who stood in the court dock with arms folded and showing little outward signs of emotion as he was sentenced. Crown prosecutor Andrew Anderson told the court Brown had been released from custody on April 22, 2008, after being acquitted at trial of the sexual assault of a child. Six days later, he broke into the womans home to find his victim asleep in bed. Her only recollection of the violent attack was waking to find Brown repeatedly punching her in the face. Her next memory was of waking up in hospital where she remained for two weeks with multiple injuries including a broken jaw and fractured nose which has left her with permanent loss of the sense of smell, the court heard. Despite her horrific facial injuries, it was the loss of smell which amounted to grievous bodily harm of which Brown was found guilty along with charges of rape, burglary with violence and stealing, all arising from the incident. His five-day trial had heard Brown was convicted of a similar incident in 2006 when he had tried to pull a mature-aged woman from her Newtown home late at night only for the woman to fend him off with her walking frame. When the woman screamed, Brown had fled, but was located by police in a nearby park. Judge Wall yesterday paid tribute to the grandmother victim who he said had worked very hard to overcome her fears and the significant impacts of Browns calculated and persistent attack at her Centenary Heights home. Referring to the womans victim impact statement, Judge Wall noted the victim had gone through psychiatric counselling and still woke at times to a dark presence in her room. The attack had also had a significant impact on the womans family who had been left with ongoing concerns for her, he said. http://www.thesatellite.com.au/story/2010/08/04/Convicted-rapist-Arthur-brown-showed-no-emotion/|/images/arthur_richard_brown_2.jpg

IAN JOHN BRUMBY (TAS)|yrs old|To be updated.|Ian Brumby- Assault, robbery and rape. News (26-3-2012)- "Worst criminals able to reoffend"- Some of Tasmania's worst criminals are reoffending after the court refuses to declare them dangerous criminals a classification that gives judges the power to jail them indefinitely. There are seven declared dangerous criminals in Tasmania, being mostly child abusers and serial rapists. Beyond Abuse spokesman Steve Fisher said it appeared either the Director of Public Prosecutions was not making enough dangerous prisoner applications to the court or the court was rejecting too many. The Supreme Court in 2003 refused a prosecution application to declare child sex abuser Anthony John Minney, of Launceston, a dangerous criminal, yet he was jailed last September for 14 months after pleading guilty to loitering near children. Minney has a long history of sexually assaulting children and last year asked police to send him to prison. In 2003 Justice Ewan Crawford said Minney's child sex abuse case was ``not sufficiently exceptional'' to justify making a dangerous criminal order. "Seven people (declared dangerous) across the whole of Tasmania does not seem to indicate they are using the tool at their disposal enough, '' Mr Fisher said. "The dangerous criminal register was brought in to serve a purpose and that's to do exactly that to keep them off the street.'' Late last year convicted serial rapist Kevin Richard Bell failed in his bid to have his dangerous criminal order overturned. Bell was sentenced to 12 years' jail in 1991 for six rapes, one indecent assault and four counts of defilement of a young girl. Six months after being paroled in 1998, he committed sex offences against children aged three and 16. Rocherlea man Brendan James Freeman was declared a dangerous criminal in 2004 and sentenced to seven years' jail after admitting to raping and bashing a woman in Launceston. Colin John Sparkes (1997) was also placed on the list after being convicted of burglary with intent to rape. Other criminals the DPP has applied to have placed on the dangerous criminal register include Ian John Brumby (2002) who had committed assault, robbery and rape, and serial rapist Paul Vincent Phillips (1998).http://www.theadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/worst-criminals-able-to-reoffend/2500119.aspx
GREGORY MARK BRYAN (NSW- Mount Riverview)|49 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 3-11-2006, in the Penrith District Court, to 5 yrs jail - 3 yrs non parole.|Former senior pastor with Blue Mountains City Church at time of offences. Found guilty of two counts of sexual intercourse with a child, two counts of homosexual intercourse with a boy, and two counts of aggravated indecent assault. Victim was a 15 yr old boy. News (15-11-2006)- "Jail term for sex offender" A 21-year-old former Blue Mountains man has spoken of his anguish at being sexually abused by a church pastor following the sentencing of the abuser in Penrith District Court on November 3. Judge O'Reilly sentenced Gregory Mark Bryan, 43, of Mount Riverview to five years jail, with a non-parole period of three years, following a trial in September. Bryan, a senior pastor with Blue Mountains City Church at the time of the offences, was found guilty of two counts of sexual intercourse with a child, two counts of homosexual intercourse with a boy, and two counts of aggravated indecent assault. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. The court heard Bryan had sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old boy between June 9, 2000 and February 28, 2001 at the pastor's home. In his victim impact statement, the man said Bryan was like a father figure to him, before taking him on a "journey to hell". "Every day I relive what he did to me on that journey and the horror is as real today as it was then. I don't think I can ever forget the pain and shame," the statement said. The man, whose name was suppressed by the court, also criticised Blue Mountains City Church for its handling of the then allegations. "They did in fact pressure me to think that this gross immorality was all in my head and that I had difficulty in differentiating truth from fiction," his victim impact statement said. Blue Mountains City Church issued its own statement following the sentencing, saying its senior pastors and executive acknowledged the verdicts. "These events cause sadness, hurt and pain to all involved within and without the church community," the statement said. "The alleged offender was a pastor in this church for several years. He was stood down from all ministry roles as soon as the Senior Leadership were advised of a police investigation into allegations made against him. "As soon as the Church Leadership became aware of the allegations, both the alleged victim and alleged offender were advised in writing that support and counselling were available. The church will continue to be available for support." The statement also said the church understood Bryan plans to lodge an appeal. http://www.bluemountainsgazette.com.au/news/local/news/general/jail-term-for-sex-offender/488003.aspx

JEREMY PHILIP BUDDLE (TAS - Hobart)|41 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced March 2011, in the Hobart Supreme Court, to 18 months jail - last 6 months suspended.|Child pornography. "Doctor appeals porn term" (10-8-2011) A Hobart doctor jailed in March for accessing 63,000 child pornography images appealed the severity of his sentence in the Supreme Court in Hobart yesterday. Jeremy Buddle, 41, was sentenced by Justice Shan Tennent to 18 months in prison with the last six months of the sentence suspended. Buddle was placed on the sex offenders' register for five years on his release from jail. Yesterday, Buddle's defence lawyer Kate Cuthbertson said the sentence was manifestly excessive. Ms Cuthbertson said her client was remorseful for his actions and had empathy for the children depicted in child pornography images. She outlined several local cases where offenders received similar sentences for crimes which, she said, appeared more serious than Buddle's. Ms Cuthbertson said Buddle had never been married and had been attracted to young boys since adolescence. He had never acted on his impulses in a physical sense and had been careful not to be left alone with boys, she said. He had quit his job as a GP when he was charged with the offence, causing a dramatic loss in income and reputation. "The impact on his life and profession has been very significant," Ms Cuthbertson said. Crown prosecutor Ian Arendt said although Buddle's crimes were not at the upper end of the scale of seriousness they were nevertheless very serious and about halfway there. Mr Arendt said Buddle had accessed pornography on a nearly daily basis over a four-year period. Chief Justice Ewan Crawford said Buddle's offending had been consistent. "It is hard to believe people who claim remorse when they have been offending every day for a number of years," Justice Crawford said. Justice Crawford, Justice Alan Blow and Justice David Porter reserved their decision. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/08/10/252031_tasmania-news.html "GP caught in global porn ring" (18-3-2011) http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/03/18/215391_tasmania-news.html "Child porn GP plans to appeal" (5-3-2011) http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-04/child-porn-gp-plans-to-appeal/1967648 "Doctor pleads guilty to child porn charges" (11-2-2011) http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-02-10/doctor-pleads-guilty-to-child-porn-charges/1938456|/images/jeremy-buddle-2.jpg

BRYAN DESMOND BULL (QLD- Ipswich)|50 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 5 yrs jail - reduced to 3.5 yrs on appeal.|Bryan Bull- found guilty of Rape. Victim was a 12 yr old girl. News (2-4-2012)- "Rapist has sentence reduced"- An Ipswich man jailed for raping a 12-year-old Toowoomba girl after meeting her mother on a dating website has had his sentence reduced by 18 months. But Bryan Desmond Bull was unsuccessful in overturning his rape conviction when he appealed his case in the Queensland Court of Appeal. Bull was found guilty of rape after a trial in the Ipswich District Court last year, but was acquitted of two other offences. In challenging the verdict, he argued the conviction was unreasonable and inconsistent with the acquittals, the prosecutor misstated evidence in a critical respect and the judge did not direct the jury that a doubt entertained about the victim's evidence on one count was relevant to the overall assessment of her credibility. Bull also argued the sentence was manifestly excessive. Bull, who was 45 at the time, got to know the girl's mother through an internet dating service. They met for the first time on Good Friday, 2007. The woman drove from Toowoomba to Ipswich for the first date of a short-lived relationship that ended the following July. A Court of Appeal judgment detailed how the couple spent weekends together and the mother sometimes left her children with him, which is when the rape occurred. Justice Richard Chesterman said the trial judge had noted the serious emotional impact the offence had upon the girl and her mother. "He described the rape, correctly, as opportunistic and noted (Bull) had taken advantage of the child for his own sexual gratification," he said. "He had misused his position of the child's temporary guardian in the absence of her mother. "The offence occurred when (the girl) was ill and her mother was unable to care for her by reason of her work commitments. "Although there was no violence involved there was a degree of force. "(Bull) ignored and overwhelmed (the girl's) reluctance to take part in the activity and pushed her head onto his penis. "Discerning gradations in depravity is a difficult if not impossible task, as is determining a precise level of punishment for each grade. "The cases can be no more than indications of available ranges for roughly comparable offending. "The offending is rightly regarded as serious, but comparison with other like cases indicate that the sentence is excessive." Three Court of Appeal justices unanimously agreed to reduce Bull's sentence from five years to three-and-a-half. http://www.thechronicle.com.au/story/2012/04/02/rapist-has-sentence-reduced/

SHIRLEY ANN VERONICA BULSEY (WA- Oombulgurri)|yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 4 yrs and 9 months jail.|Shirley Bulsey - convicted 4 counts of child sex abuse. News (8-6-2010)- "Hope at last for 'hell on earth'" IT was just days after the Howard government announced its controversial intervention in the Northern Territory when the man dubbed Oombulgurri's sheriff boasted his community was free of child sex abuse. Reading Darren (Darryl) John Morgan's comments in a local Perth newspaper in mid-2007, Kimberley detective Tom Doyle - who had been investigating shocking cases of child sex abuse across the north of Western Australia - was instantly suspicious. "Darryl Morgan was pictured holding a baby and saying, 'This is the only place without child sex abuse.' That's probably what sparked the investigation into Oombulgurri, I looked around and asked a few of the Aboriginal ladies in Kalumburu [900km northeast of Broome], 'Is it happening over there?' "Most of those women were from Oombulgurri originally and they said, 'That's exactly what's happening over there.' " Three years on, Morgan, the community's head warden, has been convicted of 21 counts of abuse against two girls as young as 12, and has been sentenced to 10 years in jail. His wife, Shirley Ann Veronica Bulsey, was convicted on four counts of child sex abuse, including two of preparing one of the girls for Morgan to have sex with. She has been sentenced to four years and nine months in jail. The charges against Morgan and Bulsey were among 109 laid against seven alleged offenders after Doyle and a team of sex crime detectives spent 18 months uncovering what they describe as the town's "deeply guarded secret". Doyle says everyone who had links to the town, including government workers, knew that child sex abuse had been going on for years but no one knew what to do. "It was hard to approach and deal with something that had been going on for so long," he says. Victims felt extreme shame and were too afraid to come forward because of the level of fear and intimidation exerted by some of the town's leaders. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/hope-at-last-for-hell-on-earth/story-e6frg6z6-1225876662037

DALE MARTIN BURNS (QLD)|40 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Dale Martin Burns- Paedophile/ Repeat Offender. News (8-4-2008)- "34-point supervision order for pedophile" Queensland's chief justice has defended the judicial system's role in dealing with prisoners who fall under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. Chief Justice Paul de Jersey today said judges were often required to exercise "a sensitive, difficult and not infrequently controversial jurisdiction", and that recent criticism about the release of some prisoners has been unwarranted. The comments were made in a written judgment handed down today which ordered the release of a serial pedophile under a 34-point community-based supervision order. Dale Martin Burns, 36, has been serving a four-year jail sentence for indecent dealing with children under 16. The offences involved three male victims - aged between 13 and 14 - who he met in his role as a cricket coach. Between May 2002 and June 2003 Burns "groomed" the boys and encouraged them to participate in sexual activities, for which he would reward them with cigarettes. Burns had previously been convicted for other child sex offences, some of which were committed in 1989 when he was a trainee football coach. He is due for release later this month under the new supervision order. Under the order Burns is prohibited from coming into contact with children and from taking drugs. He must also undergo extensive rehabilitative therapy. In handing down the order, Chief Justice de Jersey defended his decision, saying all the evidence provided to him supported Burns's release. "It would be nothing short of capricious for a judge nevertheless to order continuing detention: that would amount to a surrender to passion or prejudice or other irrelevant considerations, and an abrogation of judicial responsibility," he said. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/34point-supervision-order-for-pedophile/2008/04/08/1207420370863.html

Victim was a young Aboriginal woman. Co-offenders - Joshua Peter Marshall and Julian Marc Lawton . News (11-2-2011)- "Trio sentenced for gang rape"- Three men found guilty of the pack rape of a young Aboriginal woman have each been sentenced in the Rockhampton District Court today to between seven and eight-and-a-half years in prison. Judge Grant Britton delivered his judgment after hearing submissions from Crown Prosecutor Joshua Phillips and defence lawyers yesterday. A jury took four hours to come to a verdict which found Joshua Peter Marshall, 20, Davin Roy Butler, 23, and Julian Marc Lawton, 25, each guilty of two counts of rape and one of attempted rape. During the trial the court heard that Butler and Marshall had sex with the woman without her consent at a park near the South Rockhampton Memorial Pool on December 14, 2007. Lawton was also guilty of rape because he aided and assisted the other two by his presence and also the violence he showed towards the complainant. Judge Britton sentenced Lawton to seven years in prison to reflect his lesser involvement while Marshall was sentenced to eight years and Butler eight-and-a-half years. Earlier: three men have been found guilty of a brutal gang rape of a young Aboriginal woman in a Rockhampton park more than three years ago. A jury deliberated for more than four hours before finding Davin Roy Butler, 23, Joshua Peter Marshall, 20, and Julian Marc Lawton, 25, each guilty of two counts of rape and one off attempted rape yesterday afternoon. Family members of the convicted rapists wept in the public gallery after the verdicts were read out. Judge Grant Britton after hearing submissions from Crown Prosecutor Joshua Phillips and defence lawyers for the trio adjourned the court and will deliver his sentence this morning. Mr Phillips asked for a sentence of between eight and nine years for each man. During the trial the court heard that the men had sex with the woman without her consent at a park near the South Rockhampton Memorial Pool on December 14, 2007. Mr Phillips told the court Marshall and Butler had taken turns to rape her while Lawton was also responsible because of the words uttered and the violence he had displayed towards her. He told jurors the case stands and falls on their assessment of her credibility. In a statement the complainant said she was raped by Marshall while the other two men held her down and hit her repeatedly. She said Butler then attempted to orally rape her but she bit him on the penis. Butler then raped the woman while the other two held her down again. Ross Lo Monaco, appearing for Lawton, said because his client did not physically take part in the acts of rape his sentence should be significantly discounted. He finds himself in this mess because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He had also not taken advantage of the situation for his own sexual gratification. Jeff Clarke, who represented Marshall, said his client was just 17-years-old at the time of the incident. He was illiterate and educated to a grade eight level. He asked for a reduced penalty because of his young age at the time and lack of criminal history. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/story/2011/02/11/trio-guilty-of-gang-rape-butler-marshall-lawton/

News (16-8-2011)- "Sex offender released on anti-libido drugs"- A 61-year-old dangerous sex offender has been released from a WA prison on a supervision order after taking drugs to reduce his libido. Nevil Baden Byron, who has a long history of offences, including crimes against children, and who has been in custody since 1995, had previously been granted release on a supervision order with a requirement that he undergo "chemical castration". While Byron had previously decided against taking the anti-libidinal drugs, Supreme Court Justice John McKechnie today noted that he was now participating in the treatment. Byron was released on a strict seven-year supervision order. The Director of Public Prosecutions had opposed the release on a supervision order on the basis that Bryon was "involuntarily" taking the medication. However, Justice McKechnie said in his decision today that Byron had fulfilled the "essential precondition" of his release on supervision by taking the treatment. "He is certainly participating unwillingly in the treatment," the judge said. "But he is participating." The judge noted that Byron had only made "limited" and "incremental" change after participating in various sex offenders' treatment courses, but that medication had reduced Byron's testosterone level from 8.9 to 1.2. The judge also noted that the hormone levels could be monitored so that action could be taken if they rose again. http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/10050758/sex-offender-released-on-anti-libido-drugs/

Magistrate Tony Murray was told in the circumstances of complaint that Caldwell, 66, was convicted in Albury Court in 2003 on a charge of indecent assault on a victim aged under 10 and received a 10-month jail term. He is at present being managed under the NSW Police child protection register system. Caldwell, of North Albury, was convicted in August last year of being a convicted child sex offender loitering near the St Patricks school in Smollett St. He was seen by a witness about 4.30pm last Tuesday walking slowly in an easterly direction on the footpath outside the infants area of the school. Another witness saw him sitting on steps leading into the school hall when there were about 33 children in the after-school area located within the grounds about 50m from him. There is a childcare centre within the school grounds; at the time it was occupied by about 30 children aged between eight months and six years. Police were told Caldwell had been frequenting the presbytery to receive assistance and counsel from parish priest Msgr William Fulton. The presbytery building is located within the parish school grounds and has a direct line of sight to classrooms and the childrens play area.

Caldwell, 65, of Prune St, Lavington, pleaded guilty to being a convicted sex offender loitering near a school without reasonable excuse and having as knife in a public place.

Caldwell was seen by a police officer at 8:15am on May 5 in the car park of St Patrick Primary school in Smollett St. He was looking around the car park and school grounds area for about five minutes while young children arrived for both school and pre-school activites. Caldwell left the area after seeing the officer and walked to a nearby shopping centre before being arrested in Dean St. In 2003, Caldwell, was convicted in Albury court on indecently assaulting a girl aged under 10 and sentenced to 10 months in jail. Last year, he was warned by the same police officer about loitering around an after-achool hours program held at St Patricks. Caldwell was taken to the police station after his arrest and a pocket knife with two 6cm blades was found. He told police that he carried the knife with him and had consumed half a bottle of wine before his arrest. Caldwell was granted bail after appearing in court on May 5 and indicating he intended to plead not guilty. Solicitor Michael Hayes said Caldwell did voluntary work at St Patricks Church after attending mass each morning. Parish preist Msgr William Fulton gave evidence about Caldwells voluntary work.

Now in their 30s, the women told Campbell he had betrayed the trust of their parents and had torn their family apart by threatening to kill the girls and their family if they revealed the abuse. "They left the most precious things in their lives, their children, in your care and you abused their trust in the worst possible way," one said.

Time spent in pre sentence custody declared as time served.|Clifford Candy. Indecent treatment of a child under 12 yrs/ Sentenced May 2011. Update - Man faces flash charge (1-11-2011) Serial flasher tells court he exposed himself to overcome fears of being naked in public (21-6-2012) A SERIAL flasher who has exposed himself in public 19 times over a decade tried to convince a judge he only does it to overcome his fear of being seen naked. Clifford John Candy, 30, told the Brisbane District Court he liked to wave his genitals around "like a flag" - mainly in front of children - in front of people to fight his fear of going nude in public - and feed his adrenalin addiction The comments raised the ire of Judge Milton Griffin, SC, who described the claim as "absolutely absurd." Candy yesterday pleaded guilty to indecent treatment of a seven-year-old girl by exposing himself to her as she played in the sand on Marcoola beach, 100km north of Brisbane, about 10am on October 30 last year. The court was told Candy fled when confronted by the girl's mother, but committed another indecent act when he moved into sand dunes, stripped naked and bared his manhood to "all and sundry" on a heavily populated stretch of beach. Judge Griffin put Candy in the witness box to give evidence under oath after dismissing the accused man's claims of receiving no sexual gratification from the acts as ludicrous. "It seems to me absolutely absurd," he said. "Any member of the community would think what you were doing was not right." Mr Candy testified: "I was waving it about ... like a flag." He said his predilection for serial exhibitionism was triggered by his blinding fear of being seen naked in public. "I became addicted to chasing down that fear (of being seen naked)." "I confronted my fear. It's an adrenalin rush." "I used to ... do it behind womens' backs, but I'd dare myself to allow them to see me (naked)." Prosecutor Amelia Loode said Candy had 17 previous convictions, before yesterday, for exposing himself in public, including to young children at a video store, a shopping centre and using a flashlight to direct one child to look at him in the dark while standing in his garage. She said in 2001 Candy was convicted of exposing himself to motorists as he stood alongside of the Sunshine Motorway on-ramp. Mr Candy denied claims he was masturbating on the day, saying he was playing a peek-a-boo style of game in which he would cover his nether regions, then expose himself as cars drew near. The court was told Candy had breached a suspended bail and term and probation order as a result of his latest offences. Barrister Martin Van der Walt, for Candy, said his client claims to derive no sexual pleasure from his behaviour and feels deep shame after each act. Judge Griffin told Mr Van der Walt to take clearer instructions from his client before considering whether to call further evidence by way of a contented sentencing hearing. "Why is he doing it to children?" he said. "I have no doubt in my mind this (case) requires a custodial sentence." The hearing continues. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/serial-flasher-tells-court-he-exposed-himself-to-overcome-fears-of-being-naked-in-public/story-e6freoof-1226403798961 "Man faces flash charge" (1-11-2011) A young man accused of masturbating in front of a woman and her child on a Coast beach was remanded in custody yesterday. Clifford John Candy, 20, of Mt Coolum, was arrested about 10.20am on Sunday after allegedly committing the act at Yaroomba. Police claim Candy's alleged victims alerted a man walking past, who gave chase. They said Candy hid in the dunes but was found by other people who had joined the chase. He faced Maroochydore Court charged with indecent treatment of a child, obstructing police and contravening a direction by giving a false name.

PETER TASMAN CANNELL (SA- Adelaide)|42 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in December 2012, the South Australian Supreme Court, to 10 yrs jail - 6.5 yrs non parole.. With time already served, Cannell will be eligible to apply for parole in 2017.|Peter Tasman Cannell/ Rapist- Broke into the Adelaide home of an 81 yr old elderly woman and violently raped her.. Offence occurred in 1993/ Arrested 17 yrs after the offence in 2010, after a DNA match. News (5-12-2012)- "Rapist jailed on DNA match years after victim's death" A man who broke into an elderly woman's house and violently raped her has been brought to justice 15 years after his victim died. Peter Tasman Cannell, 42, was arrested in 2010 because of a DNA match. The South Australian Supreme Court heard he broke into the victim's Adelaide home in 1993, attacked the frail 81-year-old woman, and raped her. The court heard the victim suffered traumatic injuries and spent six weeks in hospital. Justice Kevin Nicholson said the court knew little detail of what happened because the victim died in 1997 and Cannell claimed he had no memory of the attack. "You did not give evidence at trial and your victim died on 23 July, 1997, in circumstances unrelated to your offending. As a consequence we know little detail of what happened that night," he said. "In addition there is no evidence before the court dealing with the impact this incident had on [the victim]. "Nevertheless I am satisfied it would've been a terrifying, painful and extremely distressing experience, one which she would not have recovered from psychologically or emotionally. "In her final years of life she must've been plagued with fears and anxiety." Long criminal history Justice Nicholson said a robbery bid was the most likely way the ordeal started. "Whether or not you have little or no recollection of the facts, I am of the view you probably were in a state of acute intoxication at the time, otherwise it is difficult to understand how you came to brutalise and sexually assault a defenceless 81-year-old woman during what probably started out as an attempted robbery," he said. "The offending on this occasion was very serious - any offence of rape is extremely serious but ... [rape] of an elderly 81-year-old woman after breaking into her home and accompanied by violence is particularly abhorrent and an extremely serious example of the offence of rape. "The protection of women and the elderly from attack, particularly within the sanctuary of their own home, is a primary concern of any civilised society. There can be no excuse for your behaviour on that night." Justice Nicholson said Peter Cannell had a long history of offending in South Australia, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland but his rate of convictions slowed after his son's birth and he had aspirations to be a better father and work with young Aboriginal offenders once released. "You have lived a criminal lifestyle over a number of decades now, but I accept you are not without rehabilitation prospects and you do wish to change your life," he said. Justice Nicholson jailed Cannell for 10 years with a non-parole term of six-and-a-half years. With time already served, Cannell will be eligible to seek release in 2017. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-04/rapist-jailed-dna-elderly-victim-died/4406688 http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/brutal-rapist-could-be-out-in-five-years/story-fndo471r-1226529577297|/images/peter_tasman_cannell_2.jpg

"Geelong sex fiend recaptured after escape" (20-6-2013) A Geelong sex fiend and another man who escaped Ararat's notorious Village of the Damned have been arrested by police this afternoon. David Gregory Byrnes, 26, and Sean Andrew Carmody-Coyle, 27, escaped the Corella Place facility about 11.30pm last night and have been on the run since. Polie arrested the pair on the Western Highway at Buangor at 12.40pm today. The men are serious sex offenders who were wearing electronic monitoring bracelets, which are only effective within the facility. It is understood an alarm sounded when the men made their jump to freedom. Byrnes was 19 when he pleaded guilty in 2004 to sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy in the toilet of a Geelong shopping centre. The boy had gone to the mens toilet at the Belmont Plaza Shopping Centre when Byrnes struck. As the child left a cubicle, Byrnes forces him back inside and locked the door, before assaulting him. Byrnes ran after two men entered the toilet and heard the boy crying. He was sentenced in the County Court to a minimum two years imprisonment. Byrnes had admitted 16 prior convictions, including for an indecent act against a child and crimes of violence. The sentence was later increased, on appeal, to six years with a minimum of four. Corella Place houses high-risk offenders whose sentences have expired but they are deemed to be a danger to the community. Corella Place is next to the Ararat Prison but separate from the jail itself. It is located 5km east of the Ararat township. .|/images/sean-carmody-coyle.jpg

HAROLD JAMES CARPENTER (QLD)|62 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in 1989 to 20 yrs jail.|Rapist/ Repeat offender. News (7-12-2011)- "Notorious rapist Harold James Carpenter too risky for release"- ONE of Australia's most notorious rapists is to remain in jail indefinitely despite having fully served his prison term more than two years ago. Acting Brisbane Supreme Court judge Julie Dick yesterday ordered the continued indefinite detention of Harold James Carpenter, 62, which was first imposed on September 22, 2008. The Queensland Attorney-General had applied to the court to continue Carpenter's detention order under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. Carpenter has already served 20 years' jail for the rape of a woman, then 19, in Townsville. He was previously jailed for rapes in South Australia in 1973 and NSW in 1977. Carpenter was due for release on September 23, 2008, but Queensland attorney-general Kerry Shine successfully sought an indefinite detention order. At the time Justice Ann Lyons found Carpenter was a continuing community risk and ordered he be detained indefinitely. She noted Carpenter had been out of prison for only 11 years since he was 12. The Supreme Court was told Carpenter had previously re-offended. Psychiatrists predicted that he was a high risk of re-offending. Justice Dick, in a 12-page written decision that was published yesterday, noted Carpenter had served three periods in prison for rape. "The first rape conviction was in 1973 in South Australia and (Carpenter) was sentenced to three years and 10 months' prison," Justice Dick said. "On 26 May, 1977, he was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for a rape ... (and) on 15 February, 1989, he was sentenced in Queensland to 20 years for rape." Justice Dick said Carpenter had also been charged with rape on "at least two other occasions". She said Carpenter was found not guilty of one, while the other charge lapsed when he was in prison. "All the allegations of rape have been characterised by use of violence," Justice Dick said. "(Carpenter) has other criminal history and has served other periods in custody including a conviction on 22 November, 1984, for which he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment." Justice Dick, in ordering Carpenter continue to be held indefinitely, said there was "overwhelming" evidence that the notorious rapist was "a high risk of re-offending in a violent or sexually violent way" if released into the community. "I order ... that Harold James Carpenter is a serious danger to the community ... and that (he) continue to be subject to the continuing detention order," she said- http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/infamous-rapist-too-risky-for-release/story-e6freon6-1226215608349 News Article (2-5-2008)- "Serial Rapist will Offend Again", Court Told.

"Indefinite jail term for sex offender" (18-6-2009) A repeat sex offender who raped a 77-year-old woman at a Melbourne train station has had his indefinite jail sentence continued. Kevin John Carr received what was Victoria's first indefinite sentence in 1995 after he raped the elderly woman at Spencer Street train station in 1994. He had committed the rape about a month after being released from prison. Carr had accumulated 57 prior convictions in more than 18 years, including jail terms for five separate incidents of sexual assault or rape between 1979 and 1990. On Thursday, Victorian County Court chief judge Michael Rozenes said he was satisfied Carr still posed a danger to the community. "I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that he is still a serious danger to the community," he said in his ruling. Mr Rozenes also said serious questions had been raised about Carr's willingness to take part in a sex offender's program. Carr will be able to apply for another review of his indefinite jail in three years. http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/indefinite-jail-term-for-sex-offender-20090618-cksy.html

"Violent rapist jailed for 'shocking' attack" (2-5-2011) A man has been jailed for at least 15 years for a violent assault and rape. Brett Edward Carroll, 36, told his victim he had been watching her for months before he broke into her house and bashed and raped her several times. Carroll pleaded guilty to nine charges in the Adelaide District Court. He said he had been on an alcohol and drug binge in the days leading up to the attack last September and did not remember the offending. The victim described the attack as torture and said she now lived in fear. Chief Judge Terry Worthington told Carroll his actions were shocking, especially because the woman should have been able to feel safe in her home. A jail term of 18 years with a non-parole period of 15 years was set. http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/05/02/3205293.htm
GEOFFREY DALLAS CARSON  (VIC - Bell Park)|59yrs old (2009) |Sentenced 12-1-2008 in a VIC Court to 6 months jail. Sentence added to current jail term Carson is serving/ Eligible for parole in 2yrs 27 days.|Pleaded guilty to 2 counts of committing an indecent act against a child. Victim was a 7yr old boy. Sentenced 2007 to 2yrs non parole for 5 child sex offences. Convicted in 1995 for sexually abusing a 12yr old boy/ received a suspended sentence. "Serial Bell Park pedophile given extra six months in jail for attack on boy" (18-1-2008) A sex attack on a seven-year-old boy added six months to a serial Bell Park pedophile's time in jail yesterday. Outside court, the victim's mother and paternal grandmother, who has custody of the now nine-year-old boy, said they were disappointed with the sentence. ``It's not long enough,'' his grandmother said. ``Not compared to what (the victim) is going through and how it's going to affect him when he gets older.'' Geoffrey Dallas Carson, 58, formerly of Willow Cres, Bell Park, pleaded guilty to two counts of committing an indecent act against the child. The offences happened in September 2006 when the boy spent three nights at Carson's house, which Carson shared with his wife who supported him throughout court proceedings. Carson at first denied the crimes after the boy told his grandmother Carson had squeezed his genitals and licked his bottom. Carson told police he had been playing a game with the child and may have accidentally touched his penis while he was sleeping. But moments before the boy was due to give evidence at a special hearing late last year, Carson changed his plea to guilty. In August 2007, Carson was sentenced to three and a half years with a minimum non-parole period of two years for five child sex offences committed in 1994 against a 13-year-old boy. The County Court in Melbourne yesterday heard he was also convicted in 1995 of sexually abusing a 12-year-old boy in 1994 and had been handed a two-year suspended jail sentence. In sentencing Carson yesterday, Judge Jennifer Coate said the boy's victim impact statement had said his heart was broken. ``It's clear this is serious offending,'' she said. She said Carson, who grew up on a dairy farm in Colac, had ignored earlier wake-up calls to his serial offending but she accepted he was remorseful. Judge Coate sentenced Carson to 14 months on each count of committing an indecent act on a child under 16 years, to be served concurrently. She ordered a minimum six months be added to the non-parole sentence he is already serving, meaning he was yesterday eligible for release in two years and 27 days. The victim's grandmother said she had been unaware of Carson's criminal history. She said her grandson was receiving counselling, suffered from mood swings, and had become aggressive towards his mother. Carson will serve his sentence at Ararat Prison. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2008/01/18/10605_news.html

PHILIP CAVE (SA)| 61 yrs old (2011) |Sentenced in a SA District Court, 30-4-2008, to 18 yrs jail - 12 yrs non parole.|Victims were 6 young boys. Cave would lure the boys with gifts before sexually assaulting them and taking them to other peadophiles houses to be abused. Offences occurred between 1971-76. (See also Ric Marshall). "Evil pedophile Philip Cave jailed until 93" (2-12-2011) Serial paedophile Philip Cave has been jailed yet again, and will not be eligible for release on parole until he is 93-years-old. The District Court yesterday ordered Cave, 61, serve 14 years' jail for six counts of persistent sexual exploitation of a child and one count of unlawful sexual intercourse. In sentencing, Judge Paul Rice said adding his penalty onto Cave's existing jail terms would result in a sentence of 54 years, with a 36-year non-parole period. "In making these orders, I am conscious of the fact that you may die in custody," he said. "Stepping back and looking at totality, there is scope for a modest reduction of the end result. "(The) non-parole period reduced to 33 years." Cave's offending history dates back 40 years and includes incidents in which he abused boys and then "farmed them out" to other paedophiles. His colleagues included child molester and TV host Ric Marshall. In December last year, one of Cave's previous victims dubbed him "evil" and said the paedophile had "poisoned" his life.

DEOKHWAN CHA ( QLD- Korean National)|31 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 30-8-2011, in the Brisbane District Court, to 9.5 yrs jail - 4 yrs non parole.|Deokhwan Cha- Korean tourist-Pleaded guilty to 2 charges of sexual assault, 1 of rape and 1 of assault occasioning bodily harm. Man jailed for raping fellow traveller- (30-8-2011) A Korean tourist has been jailed for nine and half years for raping a fellow traveller on a remote road in central Queensland after the pair met on an online forum. Deokhwan Cha, now 30, was travelling with a 29-year-old Korean woman in May last year when he drove her to a dusty, isolated road outside Emerald and attempted to strangle her before raping her. Cha and his victim - both in Australia on working holiday visas - arranged to search together for farming work in central Queensland after making contact on SunBrisbane.com, a chat room designed for Asian tourists. This morning, Crown prosecutor Dennis Kinsella told Brisbane District Court the woman, who has since returned to Korea, was left emotionally and psychologically traumatised after the terrifying ordeal. Cha pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual assault, one of rape and one of assault occasioning bodily harm. He also pleaded guilty to six charges of fraud and one of stealing over a burglary of a farmhouse in the hours after the sexual assault. The pair met in Gin Gin on May 17, before driving to Emerald, where they shared a caravan for the night. Although, the pair argued the following morning when Cha complained about the cleaning of dishes and demanded the woman contribute more money to the trip, the woman agreed to travel on to a farm with him in a bid to secure work there. However, Cha stopped the car on a remote road midway through their journey and began groping the woman and attempted to strangle her. She demanded he stop and take her back to Emerald. The court heard, Cha persisted and continued to demand sex. Cha then drove to another remote location, where he raped her, before taking her to a pharmacy to buy treatment for bruising on her neck. Once the pair reached the farmhouse, the woman confided in the home owner, who raised the alarm. Judge Milton Griffin, SC, said the assault was on a vulnerable and terrified woman. He accepted he was remorseful, but took in account Cha's previous rape of a woman in Korea, saying his crimes in Australia warranted time in jail. Cha will be eligible for parole after serving four years. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/man-jailed-for-raping-fellow-traveller-20110830-1jjft.html#ixzz24RvCBFwL
JEFFREY CHADWICK (Australia - QLD/ New Zealand citizen)|yrs old|Sentenced in 2011, in the District Court in Gladstone, to 3 yrs jail - 12 months non parole.|Jeffrey Chadwick - Found guilty in the District Court in Gladstone 2011, of 18 offences, including 15 counts of indecent treatment of children. "Child pornographer said to be 'unacceptable risk' to Australian community, visa cancelled, likely be sent back to New Zealand" (18-5-2013) A convicted child pornographer who took photos of his children's friends as they played at his house is expected to be sent back to New Zealand, after losing an appeal over his visa cancellation on Friday. Jeffrey Chadwick was sentenced to three years' jail in the District Court in Gladstone in 2011 after being found guilty of 18 child pornography-related offences. They included 15 counts of indecent treatment of children. He was eligible for parole after a year. Chadwick took photos of seven children on 15 different occasions, while they played with his own children at his home, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal heard. The sentencing judge said while parents trusted him to look after their children Chadwick posed them in explicit ways for his own sexual gratification. The judge said Chadwick's behaviour had been predatory, premeditated, persistent and disgraceful. Chadwick, a New Zealand citizen, began committing the serious offences within four years of coming to Australia in late 2002. The tribunal heard that a psychiatrist who interviewed Chadwick on March 26 said there was a possibility of him reoffending. "Should Jeffrey be allowed to remain in Australia and not have his visa cancelled he would pose a possible risk to the Australian community," Dr Bartholomew Klug told the tribunal in Brisbane. He said Chadwick, who still claimed he did not commit the offences for sexual gratification, did not have insight into his offending. Chadwick has an elderly father, a sister and brother-in-law who are Australian citizens, but his children were back in New Zealand. A senior tribunal member Friday on Friday affirmed the Immigration decision to cancel Chadwick's visa, mainly because of the unacceptable risk he posed to the Australian community if he was allowed to stay. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/child-pornographer-said-to-be-unacceptable-risk-to-australian-community-visa-cancelled-likely-be-sent-back-to-new-zealand/story-e6frfkp9-1226645879970

"Man pleads guilty to filming up skirts" (1-8-2011) A Sydney architect charged with secretly filming up young women's skirts has pleaded guilty to one of the charges. Sabapathy Chandrahasan, who has worked at the University of Technology Sydney, pleaded guilty at Downing Centre Local Court today to filming up the skirt of a young person under 16. Chandrahasan allegedly shot more than 1100 videos on his digital camera of mostly young women using escalators and stairs. Some of the recordings contained footage of women who weren't wearing underwear, while others featured their buttocks and underwear. The 57-year-old was arrested at Central Station in February, shortly after he allegedly filmed a woman who was climbing stairs to a platform. Police later discovered hundreds of clips on a computer at his Earlwood home and Chandrahasan was charged with a range of offences. On Friday, Chandrahasan pleaded guilty to filming a person's private parts without consent in aggravated circumstances. The charge related to video recording up the skirt of a young person under the age of 16 and recording the person's private parts covered by underwear, court papers showed. Magistrate Antony Townsden adjourned the matter for sentencing on August 26. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/man-pleads-guilty-to-filming-up-skirts/story-e6frfku0-1226085795854
LACHLAN JAMES CHAPMAN (NSW- Wodonga)|23 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced 19-2-2013, to a 2 yr community corrections order.|Lachlan James Chapman - Pleaded guilty to one charge of possessing child pornography. "Shocking porn find by girlfriend" (20-2-2013) Lachlan James Chapmans girlfriend decided to use his computer while he went to the supermarket for some groceries. But the shopping trip ended up killing their relationship after she found a pornographic video of children on a downloaded media file. The video contained footage of a boy and girl, both aged about 11, being directed by someone off-camera to carry out indecent acts. Her alarm at what she found on the computer on June 2 last year did not end there. Chapman also had some folders  hidden within other folders  containing several pornographic child images. Some of the photographs were of children as young as three. The woman confronted 23-year-old Chapman when he returned. Now that someone knows I can stop, he reasoned. His now ex-partner ordered him out of her home. So he decided to move to Wodonga to live with his father, who supported him in Wodonga Court yesterday. The woman told Albury police about her discovery and they, in turn, told Wodonga police. A police forensic search of his computer revealed that Chapman had managed to delete some but not all of the offending files. Chapman told police he had been downloading pornography  some of it adult, but mainly images of children aged between six and 16  for a number of years. Yesterday he pleaded guilty to one charge of possessing child pornography. Magistrate Stella Stuthridge said she had hoped to both jail Chapman and place him on a community corrections order but, in the end, could only impose the latter. It was a shame, she said, that she no longer had the power to put Chapman behind bars. Ms Stuthridge said it was fairly clear to most people that the children who were abused would have to suffer the consequences. Defence solicitor Mario Vaccaro said a report on Chapman had revealed he was not a paedophile. Ms Stuthridge placed Chapman on a two-year community corrections order. Chapman will be a registered sex offender for eight years. http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1313296/shocking-porn-find-by-girlfriend/?cs=11

The Brisbane District Court was told computer expert Jason Chiaravalle came under investigation after the Australian Federal Police received a tip-off from German police on December 8, 2008. The court was told Chiaravalle was working as an information technology systems engineer when police searched his home at Newmarket, on Brisbane's northside, on April 29, 2009, and seized electrical equipment including 14-computer hard drives. Commonwealth prosecutor Anthony Gett revealed Chiaravalle, then aged 21, became a convicted child sex offender in 2001 when he pleaded guilty in the district court to four counts of unlawful carnal knowledge, meaning sexual intercourse, with a 13-year-old schoolgirl" he had befriended.

A number of the captured IP addresses ... were resolved back to (Chiaravalle)." The court was told police raided Chiaravalles Newmarket home and seized a large quantity and complex network of computer equipment which... revealed a large quantity of child pornography material" had been obtained. Police observed that parts of the system had password protection, encryption and other security measures employed," the schedule says. (Chiaravalle) was served with a Magistrates order that he supply passwords and assistance to police so they could access his computers." Mr Gett said during the search of Chiaravalles home he told police: Yeah, I have done some stupid things." He said a federal agent spent an extensive period of time viewing millions of files on Chiaravalles computer equipment before being able establish as many as 325,435 contained images or videos of child pornography. The court was told that while most of the material depicted children either nude or in erotic poses, there were thousands of images involving more offensive pornography of children engaged in actual sex acts. Barrister Michael Nicholson, for Chiaravalle, said his client did not distribute, pay money for or create any of the pornography downloaded or found his possession.

SIVAKUMAR CHIDAMBARAM (VIC- formerly of Sunshine)|41 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Sivakumar Chidambaram- Pleaded guilty in the VIC County Court in June 2011 to charges- 3 counts of indecent assault on a child under 16/ 1 count of possessing child pornography. Victims were 3 girls. News (28-6-2011)- "Hare Krishna pleads guilty to child sex assaults" A devout Hindu and Hare Krishna who indecently assaulted three girls he met through religious groups was like a frightened bird, a court has heard. Sivakumar Chidambaram pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent assault on a child under 16 and one count of possessing child pornography. The Victorian County Court today heard Chidambaram had inappropriately touched the girls  aged five, seven and 10  he had met through Christian and Hindu religious groups. He assaulted two sisters in October last year while at lunch with their father at a pastor's home in Melbourne's west, and a third girl on a bus while her mother waited to meet them at a Melbourne shopping centre. His lawyer, David Drake, told the court Chidambaram, 40, formerly of Sunshine, was a devout Hindu and a Hare Krishna and described him as being "more like a child, like a small frightened bird". "He spends some three hours a day in prayer which ... involves repeating the mantra 'Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Hare Hare," Mr Drake said. "He says that thousands of times per day and it's from that he derives inner peace." Chidambaram, a computer programmer from southern India who came to Australia in 1995 for work, abused the 10-year-old and seven-year-old sisters after meeting them and their father through a small Christian religious group. He had met the family a couple of times before they were all invited to lunch at the pastor's home in Melbourne's west in October last year. While the girls' father was inside, they played in the garage, where Chidambaram asked each of them in turn to sit on his lap to play the piano and then inappropriately touched them. The girls reported it to their mother the next day and police were notified. Less than a week later, Chidambaram was on a bus when he met a woman he was friends with through a Hindu temple. The woman was travelling with her two young daughters when Chidambaram persuaded her to go to Highpoint Shopping Centre and then offered to look after the five-year-old girl so that the mother could take her eight-year-old daughter shopping. After agreeing to meet at 5pm, Chidambaram instead took the five-year-old girl to his house, inappropriately touching her during the trip. Police found the girl more than three hours later in Chidambaram's bed, while he was taking a shower. Crown prosecutor Helen Fatouros said 54 pieces of child pornography were later found on Chidambaram's computer, showing there could be "a clear sexual interest in children" and a risk of re-offending. Justice Damian Murphy ordered Chidambaram, who has been in custody at the Melbourne Remand Centre since October last year, to be assessed for a pre-sentence clinical report and adjourned the plea hearing until July 28. http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/hare-krishna-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-assaults-20110628-1goo7.html

ROBERT CLARENCE CHILD (NSW- South Grafton)|46 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Robert Child/ Repeat Offender- pleaded guilty to charges of abduction and sexual assault. Co-offender - Caran Louise Everson Victim's life unbearable- (10-3-2011) THE victim of a couple who abducted and sexually assaulted her told District Court in Grafton she could not take a shower without remembering her ordeal. Robert Clarence Child, 45, and Caran Louise Everson, 43, abducted the victim, who cannot be identified, early last year. The pair pleaded guilty to charges of abduction and sexual assault on Monday. The couple offered her a lift home but instead drove her to another place at least 40km away from her home, where they removed her clothes and subjected her to a series of humiliating assaults. These included Everson touching her genitals and Child attempting to force the victim into oral sex by punching her twice in the stomach. The woman only escaped her tormentors by striking Child on the head with a rock, then jumping into the river where she hid overnight while Child and Everson hunted for her. In the morning she stumbled naked to a nearby farmhouse to get help. I don't like taking a shower. When I hear the sound of the running water it reminds me of the water running in the river, she told the court. The woman's legs trembled and her voice quavered as she read her victim's impact statement onto the record. In it she told the court how the ordeal had made life almost unbearable. She said she was constantly fearful for herself and her children and even things like the sound of a passing car could trigger memories of her night of torture. After her statement Child was called to the witness box. The Crown made much of two earlier convictions for sexual offences, including one at Casino 20 years ago and another in 2005. This latest offence occurred about six months after Child finished his three-and-a-half-year sentence for his 2005 conviction. The Crown said the 1990 offence was similar in many respects to the latest offence. In it Child offered a young woman a lift home, but instead abducted and raped her. He said if the victim had not hit Child and escaped into the river, it was likely the same fate awaited her. Child's defence said the offences, while serious, did not compare in terms of violence, time of detention and victim impact with some others. He also claimed Child's planning for the abduction and assault had only been minimal. He asked his client receive a sentence of no more than three years and that there should be some consideration put into alcohol counselling. Everson also fronted court and her defence counsel tendered a statement in lieu of a pre-sentence report from Probation and Parole. He said his client had been oblivious to the intentions of Child in abducting the victim. She had also been willing to give evidence should a jury trial have been necessary. He claimed Everson was under the influence of Child. Judge McLoughlin will sentence the pair tomorrow. http://www.dailyexaminer.com.au/story/2011/03/10/victims-life-unbearable-sexual-assault-court/ Couple in court over sex assault- (2-2-2010) THREE members of the gallery were ejected from Grafton Court yesterday during the bail hearings for a couple charged with sexually assaulting a 23-year-old Casino woman over the weekend. Robert Clarence Childs, 39, of South Grafton and Caran Louise Everson, 42, from Mudgee, entered pleas of not guilty to two counts of aggravated indecent assault in company, a charge of detaining a person to obtain advantage in company and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. The court was told Childs and Everson were living together at the Sunset Caravan Park in South Grafton. Childs appeared first before magistrate Kim Pogson. His appearance in court sparked a fiery outburst from the gallery. A woman cried out You nearly killed my daughter. You dog, you dog, and another man yelled an obscenity. The sheriff escorted both from the court room. Solicitor Joe Fahey, representing Childs, entered a plea of not guilty for his client. He said there were aspects of the police account of the victims escape that were open to question. Mr Pogson refused bail to Childs and he was remanded in custody to appear before Grafton Local Court on April 12. Everson appeared next and she was bailed to appear on the same date. Police allege that the couple met the Casino woman at a licensed premises in Casino. The three people went to a caravan park in South Grafton before the man and woman offered to drive the 23-year-old back to her home in Casino later in the evening. As the trio drove towards Casino the 39-year-old man allegedly pulled the car into a camping ground at Lillydale and threatened the Casino woman. The Casino woman was allegedly indecently assaulted before she was able to escape the man and woman by jumping into the nearby Clarence River. The South Grafton man and woman fled the camping ground. The 23-year-old sought help at a nearby home where police and emergency services were contacted. A crime scene was established and police conducted a number of inquiries into the incident. About 12.40pm on Sunday Grafton police arrested the South Grafton man and woman in a car in Grafton. They were taken to Grafton Police Station where they were both charged. http://www.coffscoastadvocate.com.au/story/2010/02/02/court-in-uproar-as-man-and-partner-charged-with-se/

SURIYA CHOOMWANTHA (QLD - Brisbane)|49 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in September 2013, to 10 yrs jail - must serve 80% of sentence.|Suriya Choomwantha - Paedophile. Choomwantha abducted and raped a 5 yr old girl at Springfield, west of Brisbane, on November 11-2010. "Suriya Choomwantha jailed for 10 years for abducting and raping girl, 5, at child's birthday party" (12-9-2013) A five-year-old girl could hear her distressed family calling out for her moments after she was abducted from a child's birthday party and raped nearby, a court has been told. The Brisbane Distict Court was told Suriya Choomwantha, 49, led the child away from a backyard family party at Springfield, west of Brisbane, and sexually assaulted her as people celebrated metres away on November 11, 2010. Judge Deborah Richards was told Choomwantha got access to the girl by ingratiating himself with the child's grandparents, then picking up and taking the distressed girl out front of the house, laying her down by a "red car'' and assaulting her. Prosecutor Caroline Marco on Thursday told the court the young girl later told police she could here the anguished cries of family members calling out her name within minutes of the abduction. She said that rather than let the girl go, Choomwantha pinned her to the ground and continued with the assault. The court was told once the assault ended the child, who was seriously injured, ran to aid of the family as they searched for her. Ms Marco said Choomwantha, who feared being caught, avoided being immediately identified as the attacker by running off down the street. However, he was later arrested and charged with the child's rape and abduction as a result of DNA taken from the girl in the wake of the brutal attack. The court was told DNA from girl was also found of Choomwantha's clothes. Judge Richards, who described the attack as extremely serious and worthy of a significant sentence, jailed Choomwantha for 10-years. The sentence imposed means Choomwantha is automatically deemed a serious violent offender and will have to spend at least 80 per cent of the term behind bars. The sentence comes after an Ipswich District Court jury found Choomwantha, a father of three with a fourth child soon to be born, guilty of child abduction and rape after an eight day trial in July. Ms Marco said a victim impact statement, tendered in court, revealed the young girl continued to suffer nightmares and was constantly "sad that the man had been naughty to her". Barrister Don MacKenzie, for Choomwantha, said his Thai-born client had no criminal history and was of otherwise good character since settling in Australia in 1980. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/suriya-choomwantha-jailed-for-10-years-for-abducting-and-raping-girl-5-at-child8217s-birthday-party/story-fnihsrf2-1226717673019 "Court convicts man of sickening attack on five-year-old girl" (13-8-2013) A man who abducted a five-year-old girl from a community party in Springfield before raping her has been convicted by a jury. Suriya Choomwantha, 49, was found guilty of abduction and rape following a nine-day trial in Ipswich District Court. The court was told Choomwantha attacked the child in November, 2010 at a massive party with much of the local Thai community in Springfield. Late in the night the five-year-old girl was taken by Choomwantha out of the party where he hid her behind a car and raped her. Choomwantha's defence did not deny the girl was abducted and raped but maintained his client was not the person who did it. The girl told police the man who took and raped her was wearing a black jacket and baseball cap, both of which Choomwantha's defence told the court he did not own and was not wearing on the night. However, the court heard Choomwantha's DNA was found inside the left leg band of the girl's underwear, a VB can was found at the scene with his DNA around the rim and blood and the girl's DNA were found on his shirt. The court heard Choomwantha was the last person seen with the girl before she went missing. She was spotted with him standing between his legs by her grandmother. She went missing for between 15 and 20 minutes - during which the remaining party-goers began frantically searching the house, yard and street for her. The girl was spotted by her grandfather who saw the man who took her, and described him as approximately 50, of Asian descent and wearing a black and red jacket She was picked up and carried into the house by her grandfather where she was described as crying, tense and shaking. When she was inside it was noticed her underwear was covered in blood. A medical examination of the girl found evidence she had been raped. When she spoke to police she told them she had seen Choomwantha before and he was well-known in the community but she did not know his name. She said he got her behind the car, jumped on her and hurt her. Another young girl who was with the girl when she was taken said Choomwantha knew the girl's name and called to her to get her attention. He has been remanded in custody with the sentence adjourned until a date to be set. http://www.qt.com.au/news/child-snatched-from-party-and-raped-child-rapist-h/1985912/

WARREN LESLIE CHRISTIAN (Warren Christian) (NSW - Sans Souci)|64 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in March 2013, in the to 11 yrs jail - 7 yrs non parole...Eligible for parole on December 9, 2017.|Warren Leslie Christian was found guilty of 7 charges, including sexual intercourse and the indecent assault of a victim under the age of 10, in August, 2012. Six of the 7 offences took place in the 1990s when the victim was aged between 5 and 9..He told his young victim that he would get into trouble if he were to tell anyone what had happened to him. "Paedophile sentenced" (15-3-2013) When a five-year-old boy was befriended by a man who was swimming with his dog at Sans Souci there was no way for him to know this meeting was the start of grooming process which would lead to his sexual molestation. Convicted paedophile Warren Leslie Christian, 64, was sentenced to a minimum of seven years' imprisonment on Friday, almost two decades after he sexually assaulted the boy he first met in the water. Judge Jonathon Williams sentenced Christian to a maximum of 11 years in custody. He will be eligible for parole on December 9, 2017. He was found guilty of seven charges, including sexual intercourse and the indecent assault of a victim under the age of 10, in August, 2012. Six of the seven offences took place in the 1990s when the victim was aged between five and nine. The sexual assaults occurred in Christian's Sans Souci house on three separate occasions when the victim was invited to come inside. He told his victim he would get into trouble if he were to tell anyone what had happened to him. During sentencing Judge Williams said he had taken into consideration Christian continued to deny any wrongdoing. "[The offences] were opportunistic," Judge Williams said. "Children should be allowed to develop in their own time," he said. The court heard the victim had suffered confusion about his sexuality growing up as a result of the assaults. This confusion led him to have consensual sex with the offender when he turned 18, as he tried to figure out whether he was homosexual. Christian was first found guilty of the offences by jury in 2010 but appealed the conviction in the Court of Criminal Appeal in March 2012. A retrial was ordered and Christian was released from jail. He was taken back into custody after he was found guilty of all charges in his third trial in August. http://www.theleader.com.au/story/1362210/paedophile-sentenced/

REBECCA JANE CLARKE (NSW)|28 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|News (6-12-2007)- A woman involved in home-made porn films with two 14-year-old Adelaide girls has been found guilty of criminal offences. Rebecca Jane Clarke, of Goulburn in NSW, was found by a South Australian District Court judge to have incited the teenaged girls to perform sex acts. The 23-year-old also was found guilty of producing child pornography by Judge Michael Boylan. Clarke had pleaded not guilty to charges of inciting a child to commit an indecent act and producing child pornography, telling her trial she believed the girls were 17-years-old. Clarke was one of three people charged over the filming of six home-made pornographic films between July 2005 and February last year. Her co-accused - Daniel Troy Osis, 25, and Renee Jean Malyschko, 23 - were tried separately and pleaded guilty in June this year to having unlawful sexual intercourse with the two 14-year-old girls. Osis and Malyschko also pleaded guilty to two counts each of inciting a child to commit an indecent act and producing child pornography, while Osis was convicted of two further counts of possessing child pornography. Both have yet to be sentenced. Judge Boylan found Clarke guilty on Thursday despite saying she "honestly and, indeed, reasonably believed the two girls were 17". "I'm of the view that does not matter given the gravity of the offence," Judge Boylan said. Sentencing submissions for Clarke will be held in January next year. http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=333008

PHILIP VIVIAN CLAY (Philip Clay) (VIC - Wimmera region)|56 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in April 2013, in the County Court, to a community corrections order.|Philip Vivian Clay - Paedophile - pleaded guilty in 2013, to 3 charges of committing an indecent act with a child under 16. .Victim was a boy aged under 10 yrs old. "Community order for child abuser" (17-4-2013) A man who sexually abused a young boy who was left in his care has been warned by a County Court judge to stay away from children and threatened with a jail term if he offends again. Philip Vivian Clay, 56, was on Wednesday put on a community corrections order and told his name would be put on the sex offenders register for life after he pleaded guilty to three charges of committing an indecent act with a child under 16. The court heard Clay befriended a boy aged under 10, who was left in his care by the boy's mother, after she and her son had moved to Victoria from interstate. The mother was aware Clay had molested other children earlier in his life but was convinced by others he had changed his behaviour. The court was told clay touched the boy's penis and let him touch his own penis while in his care between January 1 and December 13, 2011. The boy, who was tested for slight autism, told police and Department of Human Services workers what Clay had done when they visited his school. Judge Liz Gaynor, in sentencing, said Clay betrayed the trust of the boy and his mother and that any instance of sexually abusing a child was appalling. But she said sending him to prison was inappropriate given his poor health and personal circumstances and that the community would be better served by him undergoing treatment in a program for sex offenders. Judge Gaynor said Clay was sexually abused as a child by his own father and that he had intellectual learning difficulties. A recent assessment found he had an IQ of 70, which qualified him to be a client of Intellectual Disability Services. Judge Gaynor said she accepted Clay's intellectual functioning played a large role in his offending, but she warned him he would be jailed if he breached his community corrections order. "You really need to keep away from children, Mr Clay," she told him. "I am satisfied you don't know what you are doing is very wrong, but it has a terrible effect on children and it will have a terrible effect on you." http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/1438459/community-order-for-child-abuser/?cs=6

ANDREW CLAYTON (VIC- Melbourne/ Windsor)|22 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Andrew Clayton- Pleaded guilty to 2 counts of using the internet to groom a person under 16 for a sexual act, and 2 counts of using the internet to procure a person under the age of 16 for a sexual act. Man pleads guilty to Facebook sex-grooming charges A STUDENT "friended" more than 500 teenage girls on Facebook and then pestered four of them for sex and to undress on a webcam, a court heard today. Prosecutor Sian Coidan said Andrew Clayton, 22, used a false name and claimed to be a teenager when he offered his victims money to pose nude and threatened to kill himself if they refused. Clayton also offered victims free concert and movie tickets if they undressed for him on a webcam and told one of the girls they could be "friends with benefits''. He also asked girls for detailed descriptions of their underwear and bra sizes. Ms Coidan told the County Court pre-sentence hearing in Melbourne that between June and October last year Clayton had a number of contacts with the girls, aged from 13 to 15, through Facebook, MSN and on Skype. He claimed to be called "Matt" and posted false details and photographs to dupe the girls into believing he was a schoolboy who was looking for a girlfriend. Ms Coidan said Clayton asked a 15-year-old on MSN to show her breasts and private parts on a webcam. When she blocked him, he responded by sending her nasty messages with the words "Oi bitch'' and "Oi f-head''. He told a 13-year-old girl he was a Trinity Grammar student, said he loved her, asked her for details of her underwear and suggested they meet so they could both lose their virginity. Ms Coidan said Clayton demanded the girl go on webcam and said he would kill himself if she refused. One of the girls gave Clayton her mobile phone number, and when they talked on the phone he put on a high-pitched Irish accent. Clayton, of Windsor, pleaded guilty to two counts of using the internet to groom a person under 16 for a sexual act and two counts of using the internet to procure a person under the age of 16 for a sexual act. Ms Coidan said one of the victims agreed to meet Clayton at a park, where she was approached by a man in his 40s who was not Clayton. The man tried to grab her and she ran off. Defence counsel Tara Hartnett said the offences were serious but Clayton should be distinguished from middle-aged offenders who tried to groom young girls on the internet. Ms Hartnett said Clayton had a difficult background of family breakdown, depression and isolation and she would ultimately argue he should not go to jail. Judge Carolyn Douglas adjourned the plea hearing. http://www.news.com.au/national/guilty-plea-over-facebook-grooming/story-fndo4cq1-1226439477520

See also Co-offender - Natasha Heel Sleazy grub took shots of young naked girls (14-9-2007) Tony Clerc pretended to be a fashion photographer but the 100 sleazy and lurid pictures he took of three 15-year-old Mackay girls were nothing but pornography. The innocent girls were plied with alcohol to reduce their inhibitions. The pictures showed them naked, wearing g-strings, kissing and fondling each other and in various sexual poses. Clerc appeared in several pictures himself, with his face close to one girl's private parts. In another picture he had his hands around another girl's breasts. He had a wardrobe of adult clothes and lingerie, leather and skimpy outfits and sexual aids which he used in some of the pictures. Judge Terry Martin, SC, told Clerc his conduct was clearly disgraceful and said: "Children of this age have to be protected, even from themselves, because of their immaturity." Clerc, 45, a lawn mowing service operator, of Eimeo, pleaded guilty in the District Court in Mackay yesterday to 18 charges of indecently treating three girls under 16. Clerc originally faced 100 charges of indecent treatment and two charges of rape but the Crown proceeded with only 18 indecent treatment charges relating to photographs Clerc took at his home. Judge Martin said Clerc lived with a 20-year-old woman who introduced the girls to him so he could photograph them. Judge Martin said he accepted that the girls were willing participants in the photo sessions and there was no suggestion of fear, threat or force being used in any way to get them to pose for the pictures and there was no commercial element to the offences. However, he described some pictures in detail before handing down the sentence. Some of them included the girls in various sexual poses and holding sex aids. Judge Martin did not describe all the photos in question but he gave a graphic account of their general content. The Judge said he accepted that Clerc was now remorseful and that he had pleaded guilty sparing the girls from having to testify at any trial. Clerc was jailed for two-and-a-half years, to be suspended after serving 10 months. Judge Martin ordered the forfeiture of a Nikon digital camera, a 50-70mm lens, a camera bag and a filter which were used by Clerc in taking the photos. Two of the girls were in court to hear the sentence. Detective Senior Constable Greg Wass, of the Mackay Child Crime Prevention Unit, was the investigating officer.

Youth leader found guilty of sexual assault gets 14-month jail term (16-10-2010) A BALLARAT church youth group leader has been jailed for 14 months after he was found guilty in the County Court at Ballarat yesterday of sexually assaulting a boy in his care. Darrell Cocking, 75, was found guilty of five counts of indecent assault with a male under 16 and two counts of gross indecency with a male person under 16. The offences occurred between July 1, 1980, and February 28, 1981, while the victim, then 12 years old, was a member of a Ballarat church youth group. Judge Barbara Cotterall sentenced him to 34 months imprisonment, with 20 months to be suspended for three years. Cocking will be registered as a sex offender for the rest of his life. The victim's mother wept with joy as the sentence was read out and said justice had been served. "We put our sons in his trust," she said. "I thought he was a family friend. "It was very difficult for (my son) to come forward, it wasn't easy, he was very brave." In her sentencing, Judge Cotterall said Cocking had breached the trust of the church congregation and the boy's parents. A victim impact statement read to the court revealed the victim, now aged 42, had low self-esteem, and trouble with relationships and holding on to a job. "He lives in constant fear that something of this nature will happen to his two sons," she said. Judge Cotterall said Cocking had destroyed the innocence of a child in the one place his parents thought he would be safe. In her sentencing, she took into account his age and commitment to the community since the offences took place. "You are physically and emotional different to the man who so gravely offended against a ... boy in your care," she said. The victim's mother said the decision had cemented her faith in the justice system. "It's been a long time coming," she said. "We couldn't have hoped for a better result. "It's been very difficult for my son, more difficult than I could understand. Hopefully now he will be able to move on." http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/youth-leader-found-guilty-of-sexual-assault-gets-14month-jail-term/1970601.aspx

LEIGH ANDREW COGHLAN (Leigh Andrew Coghlan) (TAS - Campbell Town)|41 yrs old (2013)|To be updated.|Leigh Andrew Coghlan - Pleaded guilty in Nov 2013, to 12 charges of accessing and sharing child pornography. "Paedophile to put aside childhood claims" (11-12-2013) A Campbell Town paedophile will no longer rely on claims made in court that a bizarre childhood led to some extreme sexual fetishes like a desire to wear nappies. Last month Leigh Andrew Coghlan, 41, pleaded guilty to 12 charges of accessing and sharing child pornography. The charges related to more than 1000 child exploitation images and videos found on two computers. During his plea of mitigation on November 26, Launceston's Supreme Court heard his mother had dressed him like a girl when he was a child. Family members then began calling him "little sister". It was put that this dysfunctional upbringing had led to his paraphilias, such as nappy wearing, the desire to be treated like a female infant and urophilia. Yesterday Commonwealth prosecutor Ian Arendt said his office now took issue with these asserted facts. Justice Robert Pearce pointed out they were made in open court and the prosecution had been present at the time. Mr Arendt said it was when they appeared in The Examiner's coverage of the case that Coghlan's family contacted the Australian Federal Police to dispute the claims. On this basis the prosecution would seek to contest the claims depending on how much weight Justice Pearce planned to give them during sentencing, he said. Defence counsel Alan Hensley said Coghlan would no longer rely on the assertions that his mother dressed him like a girl when he was a child. He said more important was a psychiatrist's finding that Coghlan's attraction to pre-teen girls was due to a sexual encounter he had with a 10-year-old when he was just 12. Mr Arendt will examine how much weight medical reports tendered to the court had relied on the claims. The case resumes today. http://www.examiner.com.au/story/1964997/paedophile-to-put-aside-childhood-claims/

News - Collingwood, 46, has offended while on parole and committed serious offences across New South Wales and Western Australia, before targeting Ms H in Victoria this year. After several spells in prison, depraved Collingwood held a woman captive at knifepoint and subjected her to violent sexual assaults over 24 hours in 2000. Psychologist Dr Sid Srna said Collingwood "scored very highly on the dangerousness scale" and "presents a constant danger to the community." He added: "It is likely that his dangerousness is to increase with time and the crimes to become gradually more serious" -Below. "Violent rapist attacked woman while under supervision" (19-7-2013) A serious sex offender sent back to jail this week was under a state government supervision order and wearing an electronic ankle bracelet when he held a knife to his latest victim and violently raped her. Gary Collingwood was under an order which monitors criminals who have completed their sentences but are still considered a risk to the community. The Department of Justice can apply to the court for supervision orders and ask for conditions. This includes curfews, electronic monitoring devices, alcohol and drug bans and exclusions from certain areas if a person remains a threat. But Collingwoods victim has demanded to know why a person with a history of violent and sexual crimes, dating back to 1984, was allowed to walk free from a Western Australian jail in August last year. She believes a person deemed dangerous enough to be monitored should never be released into the community. Sarah (not her real name) was raped in January after meeting Collingwood online two months earlier. He held a knife to Sarahs face, tied electrical tape around her hands and legs and stuffed her mouth with a stocking while raping her. She believes that based on his history and poor chance of rehabilitation, Collingwood should never have been set free  or given access to the internet. She said this allowed him to prey on innocent women. This rapist was out (of prison) in August and raped me in January, he had me targeted from November, she said. He will be out when he is 57 or 60, and he will do it again. His only punishment is he cant walk out of a gate now for 13 years. Im punished for life. The sentence is almost the same as the last time he did it. Wheres the justice in that? Corrections Minister Edward ODonohue yesterday said the government was limited in how it could supervise those who had served sentences imposed by the courts. Supervision orders let us go as far as we can in supervising offenders who have done their time without breaching the constitution, he said. I have enormous sympathy for the victim in this case. But we are constitutionally limited in what we can do to restrict people who have already served the sentence the court has given them. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/1647861/violent-rapist-attacked-woman-while-under-supervision/|/images/Gary-john-barker-aka-gary-collingwood-2.jpg

"John Collins, 74, guilty of drugging and raping women after luring them to his yacht" - A Queensland man found guilty of drugging and raping women after luring them to his yacht still insists he is innocent. John Collins, 74, enticed the young women to work as a nanny on his yacht by promising travel to Queensland's Whitsundays and other tropical islands. During his trial, the Supreme Court in Brisbane heard Collins would offer his victims a spiked drink and then rape or sexually assault them. Two of the women fell pregnant, prosecutor David Nardone said. Collins pleaded not guilty to 22 charges, including 10 of rape and five of stupefying in order to commit an offence. The court heard the offences took place between 1986 and 2000, at various places between the Gold Coast and Bundaberg. After more than a week deliberating, the jury on Friday found him guilty of 19 counts, and not guilty of two. They were unable to reach a verdict on one charge. Following the verdict, Collins, who sacked his lawyers at the start of the trial and represented himself, complained he had been unfairly convicted. "I just can't believe that. I am 100 per cent innocent and I've been found guilty of all of these crimes," he told the court. Collins will be sentenced on April 3. http://www.news.com.au/national-news/queensland/john-collins-74-guilty-of-drugging-and-raping-women-after-luring-them-to-his-yacht/story-fndo4ckr-1226598427028|/images/john-collins.jpg

Judge Boylan said Collins was dismissive of the victim when she eventually confronted him several years ago - telling the woman the abuse was `just a bit of fun' "Your answer to her on that occasion sums up the way you treated her - as a toy to be played with at your whim," Judge Boylan said.

Pleaded guilty to 20 counts of visually recording a private activity, and 11 counts of indecent acts in public. News (28-5-2012)- A MAN who took photos up the skirts of women in Perth shopping centres and in their own homes has avoided jail. Sebastiano Contarino, 57, pleaded guilty earlier this year to 20 counts of visually recording a private activity and 11 counts of indecent acts in public. Today in the Perth Magistrates Court, Contarino was placed on a 12-month intensive supervision order for the offences and must complete a yet-to-be-determined program as part of that order. The court was previously told Contarino, who has no prior criminal record, used a camera pen which he would place under the skirts of women without their knowledge. The incidents occurred at Perth shopping centres and in the homes of the victims, the court was previously told. The 57-year-old was arrested after shoppers saw him on February 14 last year taking pictures up the skirts of women in Woolworths at Karrinyup Shopping Centre. A search of his home computer later uncovered footage filmed up women's skirts at shops around Perth and video clips filmed up the skirts of women in the homes that he had attended in his role as a dishwasher repair man. Today in court, Contarinos lawyer Gavin Maclean said his client previously viewed his behaviour like a game but said his insight into his offences had changed. He now accepts that what he was doing was very wrong, Mr Maclean said. Magistrate Michael Wheeler said of Contarinos offending: Clearly there is a disturbing component to these offences. Its not easy to identify the reasons for doing this. A pre-sentence report on Contarino said he was unlikely to re-offend. Both Contarino and his lawyer refused to comment as they left court. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/pen-camera-pervert-gets-supervision-order/story-e6frg13u-1226369819059 http://www.smh.com.au/wa-news/no-prison-for-camera-pen-perve-20120528-1zen3.html http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/man-56-charged-over-up-skirt-photos-at-karrinyup-shopping-centre/story-e6frg13u-1226006239799|/images/sebastiano_contarino_2.jpg

News (29-11-2011)- "Teen web creep won't be locked up"- AN online predator who sexually groomed people he thought were teen girls was today given a two-year suspended jail term. Michael Contsas, 34, formerly of Northcote, engaged a 13 and 14 year old girl on a number of occasions in an online chatroom earlier this year, discussing sex in detail and using a web cam, the County Court heard. But the "girls" were in fact police posing as teenagers and Contsas was convicted for what Judge Meryl Sexton described as a "very serious crime''. "This law that you have broken is all about protecting children who can be very vulnerable when contacted online," she said. But Judge Sexton said given Contsas's difficult childhood, borderline intellect, remorse, chance of rehabilitation and absence of any similar offending, the two-year sentence could be wholly suspended for two years and the former concreter should be placed on an $800 good behaviour bond. Judge Sexton said Contsas, who pleaded guilty to using the internet to procure persons under 16 for sexual activity, would also need to take part in a sex offenders program and report to police once a year for the next eight years as a registered sex offender. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/teen-web-creep-wont-be-locked-up/story-e6frf7jo-1226209316843

Coombes, 31, is serving life in jail after he pleaded guilty in April 2010 to the murder of greyhound trainer Leo John Coutts. Coombes shot Mr Coutts, 72, in the head with a sawn-off rifle during a botched robbery in the elderly man's recently-purchased Caboolture home, in October 2007. He was also charged with five counts of rape in an unrelated series of events, also in Caboolture, in October 2007. Coombes was alleged to have orally raped a woman four times and had sexual intercourse against her will another time. It was alleged Coombes was upset with the woman because her former defacto partner owed him $5000 from a drug deal and he could not find the man. In the Supreme Court in Brisbane in March last year, Coombes pleaded not guilty but was convicted on four counts and found not guilty on another.

MICHAEL STANLEY COOPER (Michael Cooper) (ACT - Canberra)|54 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in May - 2011, to 2 yrs jail - with 12-months served by way of weekend jail and the remainder suspended with a good-behaviour order.. Sentence increased Feb 2012, in the ACT Court of Appeal, to 3 yrs jail - Half of the term will be served by periodic detention with the remainder suspended.|Michael Stanley Cooper- The largest haul of child pornography seized in the territory (ACT). Police raided that home in January 2010 after the FBI linked Cooper to two video files containing child pornography uploaded to a website. Investigators seized almost 700 computer discs and 100 DVDs from Cooper's home; the raw data was found on seven desktop computers, one laptop computer and a number of external file storage devices. Almost 700,000 child abuse images and videos were found on the computers, disks, DVDs, devices and in A4 folders. "Judges say sentence too lenient for porn offender" (13-2-2012) The territory's top judge has said a weekend jail sentence was too lenient for a mentally ill man who amassed the largest haul of child pornography seized in the territory. But Michael Stanley Cooper will not be sent behind bars full-time because he has already served most of his periodic detention. Three judges of the ACT Court of Appeal yesterday ruled the original sentence handed down by acting Justice Nield was ''manifestly inadequate''. In May last year the judge sentenced Cooper to two years, with 12-months served by way of weekend jail and the remainder suspended with a good-behaviour order. ''We've come to the view that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and did need to be increased,'' Chief Justice Terence Higgins said yesterday. The appeal judges - Chief Justice Higgins, Justice Richard Refshauge and Justice Dennis Cowdroy - increased the total sentence to three years. Half of the term will be served by periodic detention with the remainder suspended. But Chief Justice Higgins said if he had been the sentencing judge he would have locked up Cooper full-time for six months, to be followed by a year of weekend jail. During the earlier sentencing hearings Cooper was described as a virtual recluse suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and a schizoid personality disorder. The 54-year-old had no friends, no contact with his family and lived alone at his own home. Police raided that home in January 2010 after the FBI linked Cooper to two video files containing child pornography uploaded to a website. Investigators seized almost 700 computer discs and 100 DVDs from Cooper's home; the raw data was found on seven desktop computers, one laptop computer and a number of external file storage devices. Almost 700,000 child abuse images and videos were found on the computers, disks, DVDs, devices and in A4 folders. The images range from the low end of the scale used to rank the graphic nature of child pornography - the Oliver scale - through to the highest category used to classify images of sadism or bestiality. On appeal DPP Jon White argued the judge placed too much weight on Cooper's good character and not enough weight on discouraging other would-be offenders. The director also argued weekend jail was inappropriate because of the ''inbuilt leniency''. ''It has to be accepted that because it's a significantly more lenient alternative that the wrong message can be sent if it's imposed in the wrong circumstances,'' Mr White said. The Crown had called for both an increase of the two-year head sentence and a declaration the judges would have taken a tougher stance at the outset. But the prosecution conceded it would not be appropriate to jail Cooper full-time three-quarters of the way through his weekend jail stretch. Cooper's barrister argued periodic detention was the appropriate punishment for her socially isolated, mentally ill client.

Cory pleaded guilty on 2-5-2013, in the Cairns Supreme Court, to 2 charges of rape and one of murder . "Cairns man confesses rape, murder" (3-5-2013) A Cairns man once described as a "champion mate" has admitted he brutally raped and murdered 81-year-old grandmother Maria Ball almost four years ago. Raymond Kamuai Cory, 24, yesterday pleaded guilty to two charges of rape and one of murder in the Cairns Supreme Court after previously indicating he would take the case to trial. He attacked Ms Ball on May 24, 2009, as she walked along Kamerunga Rd to Rusty's Markets in the early hours of the morning. Ms Ball was found unconscious and later died in hospital. Cory was indicted on the charges yesterday and solemnly entered guilty pleas to each one via video link from prison. He will be brought to Cairns on May 13 to be sentenced by Justice David North. A mandatory period of life in prison is expected to be handed down. Crown prosecutor Michael Byrne SC said Ms Ball's family resided in Brisbane and would not travel to Cairns for the sentence as the victim's granddaughter had a three-week-old baby. Justice North consented to a video link being set up in the Brisbane office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for the sentencing. "It would not be for a public forum," Mr Byrne said. Cairns Justice Jim Henry previously indicated he could not hear the matter due to a conflict of interest. Justice North is Townsville-based. Ms Ball was a well-known figure at Rusty's Markets, where she had a stall, and she was also a charity worker with Lifeline. She was described as a "dynamo", and hundreds of people attended her funeral. A committal hearing in 2011 heard Cory was a "champion mate" who changed into a person his friends hardly recognised after a drunken accident left him in a Brisbane burns ward for months. The Whitfield man was studying horticulture at TAFE and had attended a nearby party with friends prior to the bashing. Cory was arrested in the weeks following Ms Ball's death after a city-wide manhunt, and has undertaken a number of psychiatric tests in the years since, but was found mentally fit to face court. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/cairns-man-confesses-rape-murder/story-e6frfkp9-1226634210116
CHRISTOPHER FRANCIS COSTELLO (QLD- Brisbane, Wishart)|49 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in July 2010, in the Brisbane District Court, to 27 months jail. To be released in September 2011.|Christopher Costello/ Found guilty in the Brisbane District Court in July last year, 2010, on 4 counts of using the Internet to expose a child under 16 to indecent material, and 1 of using a carriage service to groom a child under 16. Internet sex groomer's appeal dismissed (11-3-2011) A BRISBANE entertainment manager who was jailed after an online undercover police operation caught him trying to sexually groom a child in a chat room has lost an appeal against his conviction. Christopher Francis Costello, 49, of Wishart, was found guilty in the Brisbane District Court in July last year on four counts of using the Internet to expose a child under 16 to indecent material and one of using a carriage service to groom a child under 16. He was sentenced to 27 months' imprisonment, with Judge David Reid ordering he be released in September this year. During the sentencing hearing, the court was told Costello spent 13 hours in early 2009 sending messages, pornographic images, and videos of himself masturbating to what he believed was a 14-year-old girl named "Cassie". The self-employed marketing manager was unaware that he was, in fact, speaking to an undercover male police officer posing as the girl. On one occasion he phoned "Cassie" only to speak to another undercover police officer who was posing as the girl's father. Costello took his case to the Court of Appeal in Brisbane in February, where his lawyers argued the conviction was unsound because evidence was improperly led during the trial. His counsel also argued there were major flaws in the prosecutor's closing address and that Judge Reid failed to properly direct the jury about the use of circumstantial evidence. In a written judgment handed down today, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, ruling the directions and summing up were satisfactory. The court also ruled that on the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to find Costello guilty. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/internet-sex-groomers-appeal-dismissed/story-e6freuyi-1226019741759

MERVYN GEOFFREY COTTON (SA- Adelaide)|51 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 21-3-2011, in the SA District Court,to 5 months jail - fined $1000 and a 18-month good behaviour bond.|Mervyn Cotton pleaded guilty to 2 charges of aggravated possession of child pornography, and use of a carriage service to access child pornography. Was charged after Australian Federal Police raided his home, 16,452 images and 815 videos were found to be downloaded by Cotton over an 8 month period. Adelaide man jailed for child porn (21-3-2011) AN Adelaide man who downloaded more than 16,000 images of child pornography has been sentenced to five months in prison. Mervyn Geoffrey Cotton, 51, had pleaded guilty to two charges of aggravated possession of child pornography and use of a carriage service to access child pornography. Judge Barry Beazley in the South Australian District Court today also fined Cotton $1000 and imposed an 18-month good behaviour bond. "I accept you are remorseful for your offending but you must not underestimate the gravity of your criminal conduct," he said. "But for your pleas of guilty and contrition I would have sentenced you to 18 months." In sentencing, Judge Beazley said he fixed a low non-parole period acknowledging Cotton's prospects of rehabilitation and treatment in the community. "I accept that you downloaded adult pornography at the same time and therefore you do not have a particular interest, solely, as it were in child pornography," Judge Beazley said. "Matters submitted ... warrant a very low non-parole period to enable you to be rehabilitated in the community and to respond to the appropriate forms of counselling and treatment." Judge Beazley said an aggravating feature of Cotton's offence was that the images contained images of children under 14 years of age and were saved and arranged in a folder structure. "You deny having any pedophilic tendencies, you told (the psychiatrist) it was downloading which was your obsession, rather than child pornography ... driven by your obsessive behaviour and not primarily by deviant sexual arousal. "I accept the thrust of that submission, however it does not explain satisfactorily why it was that you retained that material, then as I say, catalogued it." Judge Beazley said Cotton's offending was "incomprehensible" given his long-term relationship with his partner of 29 years and position of trust with his employer of 31 years. Cotton was charged after Australian Federal Police raided his home last May to find the images and videos on three computer devices. A total of 16,452 images and 815 videos were found to be downloaded by Cotton over eight months to February last year. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/adelaide-man-jailed-for-child-porn/story-fn3dxity-1226025594796

Coupland's earliest release date is February 20, 2015.|Gregory John Coupland - Former school teacher/ Former 1st Forestville Scouts leader- Pleaded guilty to possessing child abuse material..Coupland viewed and shared tens of thousands of child porn images.. Former school teacher (year 5) at the exclusive Kings Preparatory School at Parramatta for 11 years until his arrest in June 2011.. The court heard Coupland who also acted as a photographer at school sporting events had about 35,000 images of children, mainly young boys, on his personal computer - read more below. Ex-Kings School teacher jailed for child pornography (22-6-2012) A former teacher at an exclusive Sydney boys school has been sentenced to more than two years in jail for collecting and sharing tens of thousands of images of child pornography. Gregory John Coupland, 42, was working as a year 5 teacher at the Kings School in Parramatta when he was arrested in 2011 following an Australian Federal Police sting on an online child porn ring. This afternoon in the Downing Centre Court he was sentenced after pleading guilty to three charges relating to the accessing, sharing and possession of pornographic material depicting boys and girls around the ages of eight to 15. He was sentenced to between one year and four months and two years and eight months for the charges. Two will be served concurrently and one will be served in addition. He will spend a minimum of 32 months in jail without parole. Judge Laura Wells took into account Coupland's early guilty plea but said she was not fully satisfied he understood the seriousness of his behaviour nor expressed remorse for the right reasons. She believed Coupland was "less than forthright and honest" when questioned about his actions. During the trial, Coupland said he was not aware the children in the images were under 18 and that he was not aroused or interested in young boys. He said he had first "stumbled" on child pornography after he looked up a nudist resort website about five years ago. "Perhaps that's how he found these child porn websites," Judge Wells said. "[But it] most certainly doesn't excuse the extensive period, indeed the years of abuse by him." Judge Wells said that, after viewing some of the material "for even the shortest period of time", it became apparent that the material was sexual and, on occasion, violent in nature. Coupland also had chat logs, usernames and passwords that were sexually explicit in nature. The court heard Coupland, who acted as a photographer at school sporting events, had collected 38,234 still images, 2769 multimedia files and 372 literature files classified as child pornography. The majority of these were on a laptop police found at a Forestville scout hall where Coupland was a scout leader. She noted that there was no evidence whatsoever that he ever engaged in sexual acts with boys or used images of boys from the Kings School or from the scout group for pornographic reasons. The court heard that Coupland came from a good family, was very well respected in the community and was, according to his father, a "brilliant motivator and educator". Coupland had suffered from a chronic and severe skin condition, psoriasis, since the age of two, which had made him very self conscious and prevented him from showing parts of his body or entering into a relationship but Judge Wells said this could not excuse his actions. The court heard Coupland's brother had discovered files on his computer in February 2010, leading him to confess to his parents that he had been viewing nude images of children. It was agreed that he would seek professional help but he later stopped attending sessions with a psychiatrist and resumed viewing the images. This "demonstrated a willingness to persist over time", Judge Wells said, and "he deceived those closest to him and the wider community where he was well regarded". Most of all, Judge Wells said, he had done "lasting damage" to the children involved. "Each of those children is a victim and has been adversely affected by their exploitation and abuse," she said. Coupland's earliest release date is February 20, 2015. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/exkings-school-teacher-jailed-for-child-pornography-20120622-20tbp.html "I don't like to look at young boys, says teacher who pleaded guilty to possessing child abuse material" (7-6-2012) A former teacher at an exclusive Sydney school who viewed and shared tens of thousands of child porn images has denied he likes looking at young boys, a Sydney court has heard. Gregory John Coupland, who taught at The Kings Preparatory School at Parramatta for 11 years until his arrest in June 2011, told Downing Centre District Court today he had first "stumbled" on child pornography after he looked up a nudist resort website about five years ago. "It showed families having fun in the sun," he said. Coupland, 41, from Forestville in northern Sydney, has pleaded guilty to possessing child abuse material, using a carriage service to access child pornography and using a carriage service to publish child pornography. The court heard Coupland, who acted as a photographer at school sporting events, had about 35,000 images of children, mainly young boys, on his personal computer. But he told the court: "I don't like to look at young boys." Posing as a "much younger man", he shared about 500 of those images with others online, Judge Laura Wells was told. "The images I uploaded, I believed [the children] were over the age of 18," he said. Coupland said before his arrest he did not believe he was viewing child pornography but he now knew it was. "When [the arrest] originally happened, I saw nudity not as child porn," he said. "[I thought] pornography was the act of having sex, not nudity. That's how I classified it." The court heard Coupland's brother had discovered the files on his computer in February 2010, leading him to confess to his parents that he had been viewing "nude images of children". "At the family table it was agreed I would seek professional help," Coupland said. Between February and July 2010, Coupland said he did not access any images while he was receiving counselling, but he started viewing them again from August 2010. The court heard he has been receiving professional help since he was charged. "I'm getting better," he said. The sentence hearing is continuing. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/i-dont-like-to-look-at-young-boys-says-teacher-who-pleaded-guilty-to-possessing-child-abuse-material-20120607-1zyal.html#ixzz2KwN4rYPm http://origin.manly-daily.whereilive.com.au/news/story/school-teachers-guilty-plea/|/images/gregory_john_coupland_2.jpg

Ex council employee jailed for child porn addiction (4-12-2012) WARNING: This story contains content that could disturb some readers. EVEN after police found thousands of child porn images and videos on his computer, David John Cox couldn't stop himself. The former Rockhampton Regional Council project manager's addiction intensified. Cox had downloaded more than 60,000 child pornography photos on his computer. Some of those were adults having intercourse with babies, a court heard yesterday. The 38-year-old pleaded guilty in the Rockhampton District Court to two counts of using a carriage service to access child pornography and two counts of possessing child exploitation material. Judge Leanne Clare sentenced Cox to five years in prison after police found explicit material on four monitors and a computer tower at his Gracemere home. Cox had his "sophisticated" technology system linked to a child pornography network. Crown prosecutor Peter O'Connor said Cox had categorised all the images and videos stored on his computer into five levels based on how explicit they were. Category five, described by Mr O'Connor, as containing the most graphic and gruesome images, contained photos of bestiality and sexual acts between children. Police searched Mr Cox's Gracemere home in January 2011 and found the "elaborate" network system, which contained more than 7500 child exploitation images and 918 "category five" videos. He was charged and released on bail. Ten months after raiding Cox's home, police obtained another search warrant and seized Cox's computer after finding more child pornography material. Defence lawyer Tom Polley told the court his client developed an "interest" in child pornography after the material "ended up on his computer". He had been engaging in online child exploitation material for the past 10 years, the court heard. Mr Polley said however that Cox only downloaded the material for his own viewing and didn't share the material. Judge Clare said Cox was a respectable man in the community and had a good upbringing. "No doubt your arrests and the knowledge of what you have done has been a heavy burden," Judge Clare said. He will be released on parole on July 29, 2013. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/jail-for-kid-porn-addict/1646402/

"Geelong sex fiend recaptured after escape" (20-6-2013) A Geelong sex fiend and another man who escaped Ararat's notorious Village of the Damned have been arrested by police this afternoon. David Gregory Byrnes, 26, and Sean Andrew Carmody-Coyle, 27, escaped the Corella Place facility about 11.30pm last night and have been on the run since. Polie arrested the pair on the Western Highway at Buangor at 12.40pm today. The men are serious sex offenders who were wearing electronic monitoring bracelets, which are only effective within the facility. It is understood an alarm sounded when the men made their jump to freedom. Byrnes was 19 when he pleaded guilty in 2004 to sexually assaulting a five-year-old boy in the toilet of a Geelong shopping centre. The boy had gone to the mens toilet at the Belmont Plaza Shopping Centre when Byrnes struck. As the child left a cubicle, Byrnes forces him back inside and locked the door, before assaulting him. Byrnes ran after two men entered the toilet and heard the boy crying. He was sentenced in the County Court to a minimum two years imprisonment. Byrnes had admitted 16 prior convictions, including for an indecent act against a child and crimes of violence. The sentence was later increased, on appeal, to six years with a minimum of four. Corella Place houses high-risk offenders whose sentences have expired but they are deemed to be a danger to the community. Corella Place is next to the Ararat Prison but separate from the jail itself. It is located 5km east of the Ararat township. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2013/06/20/367558_news.html

"You have an appalling criminal history for molesting little children - on any view, you are a pedophile," Judge Koppenol told Crawford, who kept his head bowed and eyes closed throughout sentencing. "You prey upon little boys for your own sexual gratification. I see little or no prospect of rehabilitation. I consider you as a person with a high risk of reoffending." -below -"Paedophile argues in court that jail term is too 'excessive'" (27-2-2013) A self-confessed paedophile who molested a friend's son at a party believes his six-year jail sentence is too harsh. Bradley Paul Crawford's lengthy sexual offending history involves indecent treatment of children. Most recently, Crawford, 35, was sentenced to six years behind bars for molesting a nine-year-old at a social gathering after gaining the trust of the victim's mother in February 2012. The Ipswich man has launched action in the Court of Appeal arguing his sentence, which involved preventative detention, was manifestly excessive. Counsel for Crawford, Katarina Prskalo, said the objective seriousness of Crawford's most recent offending did not warrant a period of six years in jail. She said the offending was over a short period and did not involve penetration. "There was nothing particularly manipulative about the offending," Ms Prskalo told the Court of Appeal on Tuesday. Crawford was "open" with the victim's mother, admitted he was a paedophile, Ms Prskalo said. The most recent offending happened four years and two months after a similar offence. "There has not been an escalation of offending in my submission," Ms Prskalo said. But counsel for the Crown, Belinda Merrin, said the sentencing judge took into account personal deterrence, public denunciation and community protection. Ms Merrin said a psychologist in 2004 considered Crawford had a life-long re-offending risk. "I accept this episode of offending was not as serious as the others but I make the point he was immediately detected and the offending was reported immediately," she said. The Court of Appeal reserved its decision. .
COLIN JOHN CRAWFORD (QLD- Ipswich)|39 yrs old (2010)|Sentenced in July 2010, in the Ipswich District Court,to 18 months jail - to be released after 6 months on a suspended sentence for 2 yrs..|Paedophile/ Repeat Offender. Pleaded guilty to indecent treatment of a child aged under 12, and attempted indecent treatment of a child aged under 16. Long history of sexually abusing boys. News (26-7-2010)- "Boy abuse predator jailed"- A CONVICTED pedophile who was investigated in relation to the disappearance of Daniel Morcombe has admitted indecently touching a boy in Ipswich. Ipswich District Court heard Colin Crawford, 39, had a shocking history of sexually abusing boys and was ordered to be chemically castrated as part of his last probation order. But Crawfords depo-provera injections stopped when his probation order finished and his urges returned, a court was told. Crown Prosecutor Nicola Howard said Crawford was working at Dominos Ipswich in February last year when three brothers aged 10, 11 and 14 came in to buy a pizza. Crawford offered to drive the boys to the Queens Park animal enclosure, where he offered the 10-year-old and 14-year-old pizza in return for sexual favours. Ms Howard said Crawford cuddled and rubbed the 10-year-old first to reassure him because he knew he was going to ask a strange question. The boys refused his advances and Crawford offered them pizza not to tell anyone. They accused Crawford of being a pedophile but he said: If I were a pedophile I would take it from you, I wouldnt ask. The boys left and told their mother but later returned to the store to receive their free pizza. Crawford pleaded guilty to indecent treatment of a child aged under 12 and attempted indecent treatment of a child aged under 16. He was sentenced to 18 months jail but he will be released after six months on a suspended sentence for two years. Upon his release, Crawford will be on probation and will be required to attend psychiatric counselling and medical treatment as requested. Ms Howard said Crawford was also convicted of four previous offences involving boys over the past 15 years. When he was 22 years old, Crawford touched two boys aged nine and 11 and he was given two years probation, but he breached the order by following another boy into a toilet. In 2001 Crawford, who often invited boys to his home to play PlayStation, was convicted of offering a nine-year-old boy $15 and sexually assaulting him and was given 18 months jail. In 2005 Crawford admitted approaching an 11-year-old boy on a street and touching him before the child fought back and flagged down a passing motorist. He was given three years probation after serving 15 months in prison waiting to be sentenced. But when the probation order finished, a doctor told Crawford he no longer needed the injections and the urges slowly returned. Defence barrister Geoff Seaholme said Crawford should not spend any time behind bars for his latest crimes. But Judge Gregory Koppenol said courts needed to send a strong message to the community that similar behaviour would not be tolerated. http://www.qt.com.au/story/2010/07/26/boy-abuse-predator-Colin-John-Crawford-jailed/ http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/pedophile-abused-boy-after-castration-failed-20100726-10qy4.html

"Terror for victim as Gold Coast sex attacker Ryan Cross goes free" (19-5-2013) The victim of a sex attack on the Gold Coast's Millionaires Row is living in fear after the predator walked free with a suspended sentence. The woman, 26, was one of several attacked while walking or jogging on upmarket Hedges Ave at Mermaid Beach in December last year. She managed to fight off her attacker and police used DNA from under her fingernails to catch 21-year-old Ryan Cross. Cross appeared in Beenleigh Magistrates Court this month and pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault. He was sentenced to 12 months' jail, suspended immediately for two years. The penalty has angered the woman and her partner. "A 12-month suspended sentence is a joke," the victim's boyfriend said. "I don't understand how someone can have their DNA on a police database, plead guilty to sexual assault and still be out among the community. "She has suffered months of nightmares and trauma already from this attack, and now there is no justice whatsoever. We just want some semblance of justice, by people being aware of what a creep this guy is." The man said his girlfriend's name had been given to Cross as part of the DNA identification process. "With him still free and knowing her name, she's more worried than ever," he said. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/terror-for-victim-as-gold-coast-sex-attacker-ryan-cross-goes-free/story-e6freoof-1226645954779 http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/two-women-sexually-assaulted-on-hedges-ave-mermaid-beach-gold-coasts-millionaires-row/story-e6freoof-1226541833797

News (17-2-2012)- "Cop posed as child in cyber sting" A Bundaberg man made sexual advances to an eight-year-old boy online, sending him pornographic images and discussing a meeting - only to find he was in fact talking to a police officer. Prosecutor David Nardone yesterday told Bundaberg District Court that Adam Lee Murray Crosswell, 25, had only been out of jail for a week when he contacted a woman via her travel blog asking if she would put him in contact with her eight-year-old son. The woman immediately became concerned and contacted police, who then set up fake online communication accounts in her son's name. "A police officer posed as an eight-year-old child and responded to Mr Crosswell," Mr Nardone said. "That communication was in the form of emailing or MSN chats." Mr Nardone said Crosswell asked the child to masturbate, and sent him two images of naked children and a naked adult. "I see that in the statement of facts, he...asked the child what he thought about meeting, (which) seemed like an aspect of grooming with intent for abuse to occur," Judge Michael Rackemann said. Crosswell pleaded guilty to possessing child exploitation material, using electronic communication to procure a child under the age of 12, two counts of using electronic communication to expose a child under 12 and one count of burglary and stealing. The court heard the stealing was an offence in 2009, in which Crosswell took $7000 worth of cash and goods in Brisbane. Defence barrister Kim Bryson said her client was the victim of physical and sexual abuse from (the ages of 11-14) by staff and other children at BoysTown. She said the defendant suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and post traumatic stress disorder as a result of the abuse and a car crash he was involved in, in which a friend had died. Judge Rackemann sentenced Crosswell to 18 months jail, to be suspended after six months with an operational period of three years. After he is released from jail, Crosswell will also be on probation for three years. http://www.news-mail.com.au/news/cop-posed-as-child-in-cyber-grooming-sting/1275005/|/images/adam_crosswell_2.jpg

Paul Cudmore, 19, who has been on a guardianship order and living at Melbourne's Statewide Forensic Services Centre after serving a six-month sentence in 2002 for a sexual offence against a minor, fled during a supervised visit to a suburban shopping centre on Sunday. Described as a serious risk to the community, Cudmore was arrested in Wagga Wagga in southern NSW two days ago. The Melbourne Magistrates Court heard Cudmore would be returned this afternoon to the strictly controlled residential environment of the centre. However Chief Magistrate Ian Gray was told Cudmore had not been charged in relation to his disappearance last weekend. Instead, he was extradited from NSW on the basis that he still had two minor but outstanding charges to face from 2002. Cudmore's lawyer, Andrew McGregor, told the court his client wanted his guardianship order reviewed and the opportunity "to demonstrate he's not a threat to the community". The court also heard Cudmore was still in the first and strictest stage of a three-part justice plan that would conclude with his return to the community. Mr Gray convicted and fined Cudmore $500 for stealing two number plates in September 2002 and failing to appear at court one month later to answer the charge. http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/05/1075853983255.html?from=storyrhs|/images/paul_cudmore_1.jpg

"The court was told Cummins was an "entrenched paedophile" who estimated he had committed more than 1000 child sex crimes."below. "Paedophile in child sex plot set free" (20-9-2012) A paedophile involved in an evil and sophisticated conspiracy to travel to Thailand to commit child sex offences after being released from jail, including plans to turn an orphanage into a child brothel and grooming Thai mothers to get access to their children, walked free from jail last night. Robert Gordon Cummins, 46, was sentenced in the Supreme Court yesterday to two years and seven months jail after admitting he conspired with two other convicted paedophiles in prison, Mark Pendleton and Kenneth William Bishop, to commit child sex offences outside Australia. But Justice John McKechnie ordered Robert Cummins be freed from jail on a recognisance release order after serving 18 months - a term which has already been served because he was taken into custody on the charges in March last year. The court was told Cummins was an "entrenched paedophile" who estimated he had committed more than 1000 child sex crimes. He met and befriended Pendleton, who allegedly included him in the Thai plot, in 2005 in a sex offender treatment program in prison. Cummins was the first to be released on parole in 2008 and started putting plans into action, including contacting Thai mothers on internet chat rooms and sending them money and gifts, such as clothing for their children, some as young as 18 months. State prosecutor Bruno Fiannaca said Cummins confessed to planning to set up a sewing business in Thailand and employ impoverished mothers from remote villages in a bid to abuse their children. He said Cummins admitted he and his co-accused wanted to become benefactors to an orphanage and "effectively convert it into a child brothel". The court was told Cummins has agreed to testify against his co-accused, who will fight the Commonwealth charges at trial. Cummins' sentence was heavily discounted because of his early guilty plea and co-operation with authorities. Justice McKechnie said Cummins joined an "evil conspiracy that had the potential for the rape of many young Thai children" and the plot "went well beyond fantasy and hope." "Conspiring to leave Australia and go to a country where poverty can make easy pickings for sexual predators brings shame upon us all," he said. Police uncovered the plot in 2008 after tapping phone calls between Cummins and Pendleton and intercepting their mail. Declared a dangerous sex offender in 2008, Cummins is bound by a strict supervised release order. .|/images/robert-gordon-cummins-2.jpg

"Former Jewish school worker jailed for child sex abuse offences" (20-12-2013) A former worker from a Melbourne Jewish college has been sentenced to eight years in prison for a string of sexual offences. David Samuel Cyprys, 45, who worked in various roles at the Yeshiva College, admitted to interfering with nine children at the school in offences dating back to the 1980s. Though several of the offences were committed while Cyprys was a minor himself, his offending continued until his 20s. He was convicted in August of five counts of rape and pleaded guilty to additional charges including indecent assault and gross indecency. Cyprus will serve a minimum term of five-and-a-half years before he is eligible for parole. He will also be put in the sex offenders register. The Yeshiva college has been widely criticised for not acting earlier on complaints against Cyprys. Manny Waks, who campaigns against child sex abuse, said outside the court that he will take civil action against the college after being given court approval to publicly declare that he was one of Cyprys' victims. "I've lived for decades in silence, shame, guilt and I'm very pleased that the judge today accepted my application," Mr Watts said. "I don't want to hide behind anything any longer, this is who I am, this is what happened to me and David Cyprys is responsible for that." Cyprys is the second paedophile to be convicted of abusing students at Yeshivah. In July, Rabbi David Kramer was jailed for abusing four boys at Yeshivah in the early 1990s. Victoria Police criticised the school for helping Kramer escape to the US. .

The eight to 15-year-old victims were abused by Daines in several small western Queensland towns.

LINDSAY GORDON DALLEN (QLD)|42 yrs old (2008)|Sentenced on the 23-2-2005 in the Southport District Court to 14 yrs jail.|Lindsay Dallen was found guilty of 8 counts of rape - 2 counts deprivation of liberty - 1 count of assault with intent to rape. Victims were 2 female foreign students (aged 23 and 28 yrs old) who were hitchhiking home from Surfers Paradise and picked up by Dallen. He bashed and repeatedly raped the students,threatened to kill them. They escaped from the boot of his car when he stopped at a service station and accidently popped the boot from inside the car instead of the petrol cap.  News (3-10-2002)- "Aussie police hunt man after tourists' ordeal"- Gold Coast - Australian police launched a manhunt on Thursday after two young Czech women students were repeatedly raped and then held captive in the boot of a car during a six-hour ordeal. Police feared the rapist planned to kill the women, aged 22 and 26, who escaped from the car boot after the vehicle ran out of petrol. "What concerns us the most is the fact that after he had raped both the girls he locked them in the boot of the car and if it wasn't for the fact they escaped of their own volition we have grave concerns about what was going to happen next," said acting Detective Inspector Ian Thompson. "This is a particularly vicious and brutal crime." Police said they wanted to question 36-year-old local man Lindsay Dallen over the attacks after viewing security video tape from a petrol station. Thompson said the attacker offered his victims a lift when they were waiting at a bus stop in the east coast resort of Surfers Paradise about 2am on Wednesday morning (16h00 GMT on Tuesday). He said once they were in the car they were unable to get out because the sedan was travelling in an erratic manner. The driver took them to bushland where they were both sexually assaulted. He said the women were then forced into the car boot and driven south towards the Queensland border with New South Wales, but the car ran out of petrol and pulled into a service station at Palm Beach. The service station attendant said the man filled up a container with petrol and was walking back to the car when the women escaped from the boot. "As he was running back to the car the girls jumped out of the boot," said the attendant, who asked not to be identified. "He tried to chase them around the car. They were screaming and pointing and crying." The man fled in the car which was later found by police. The women, both studying English in Australia, were treated for injuries in hospital then interviewed by police through an interpreter after being discharged. Thompson said Dallen was still believed to be in the area. A series of attacks on foreigners recently has tarnished Australia's reputation as a tourist-friendly destination. Last month, a German woman and her daughter escaped unharmed after being abducted by a gunman in the remote Northern Territory. English backpacker Caroline Stuttle was robbed and thrown from a bridge to her death in the Queensland town of Bundaberg in April. The presumed murder of English backpacker Peter Falconio and the abduction of his girlfriend Joanne Lees in the outback last year remains unsolved, although police investigating the crime are keen to question a man now in custody charged with unrelated crimes. - Sapa-AFP http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/aussie-police-hunt-man-after-tourists-ordeal-1.95082

The NSW Supreme court jury also found Renzo Da-Pra guilty of the manslaughter of his father on the grounds of substantial impairment. His mental state at the time was the issue for the jury. Da-Pra, 48, had pleaded not guilty to murdering his father Gino Da-Pra, 77, whose body was found in a car boot. He also denied murdering Emma Wighton, whose throat was almost severed, and causing grievous bodily harm to her grandmother, Vivienne Wighton, 77, with intent to murder her on November 18, 2009. The Wightons lived next door to Da-Pra's parents at Wetherill Park, south west Sydney. Da-Pra told psychiatrists a bikie group wanted to kill him and his father and that if he killed his father, he could save his mother. After the jury returned its verdicts, a man in the public gallery yelled at Da-Pra: "Gutless low life, that's what you are." Da-Pra is expected to face a sentencing hearing later this month. http://www.news.com.au/national/man-found-guilty-of-murdering-12-year-old-girl/story-e6frfkvr-1226362495025 News (8-5-2012)- "Home invader Renzo Da-Pra slashed throats, court hears" AN elderly woman has told of her terror when a man barged into her Sydney home and battered her senseless - before slitting her young granddaughter's throat.

ANDREW DENIS DARE (TAS- Boat Harbour)|27 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in 2007, to 5 yrs' jail - 3 yrs non parole. Paroled 3 times because of parole breaches-Below-|Andrew Dare - convicted of 2 counts of aggravated sexual assault, 2 counts of attempted aggravated sexual assault and 1 count each of rape, indecent assault, aggravated assault, aggravated burglary and robbery. Broke into a woman's Sisters Beach home, tied her up using a phone cord, raped her and then forced her to bite off her fingernails to destroy DNA evidence. News (26-9-2011)- "Rapist paroled yet again"- A MAN who committed a brutal home invasion rape at Sisters Beach while alcohol-affected has now been paroled for the third time for the same crime despite twice breaching drug and alcohol conditions that sent him back to prison. Andrew Denis Dare received his third get-out-of-jail-early pass from the Parole Board last month after having had his parole revoked twice for breaches. Dare, 27, then of Boat Harbour, was in 2007 sentenced to five years' jail, with a minimum of three years to be served, after breaking into a woman's Sisters Beach home, tying her up using wire around her neck, raping her and forcing her to bite off her fingernails to destroy DNA evidence. He was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault, two counts of attempted aggravated sexual assault and one count each of rape, indecent assault, aggravated assault, aggravated burglary and robbery. Since then, according to Parole Board documents: Dare was granted parole in June 2007, under certain conditions including he not drink alcohol; The board was advised three months later he had alcohol in his system and "it was believed he had been driving"; He then admitted to his parole officer he had smoked cannabis; He then had his parole revoked a month later, being October, 2010; Dare was then "re-released"; He then "subsequently failed a urine test"; His parole was then revoked for the second time in April this year; Dare then told the board his drug use was a "one-off event" while he was living in the community; and He was paroled for the third time last month. If Dare had served his full sentence of five years he would not have been released from Risdon or Hayes Prison Farm until September next year. After the sentence in 2007 the victim wrote to The Advocate slamming her attacker's "lenient" sentence as a fiasco. The board was aware the crimes "had a devastating effect on the victim including dealing with an ongoing physical injury sustained during the attack". Burnie Police, the Police Association of Tasmania and Survivors Confronting Child Abuse and Rape also expressed frustration at the sentence, which the Director of Public Prosecutions did not appeal against. The Parole Board chairwoman was approached for comment at work on Friday. http://www.theadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/rapist-paroled-yet-again/2303133.aspx News (5-3-2007)- "RAPE SENTENCE FURORE Police want Kons to explain"- FRUSTRATED police will take their concerns about recent court rape sentencing in the North- West to Attorney-General Steve Kons. Police Association president Randolph Wierenga said yesterday he would air their outrage during an imminent meeting with Mr Kons. Most recently, police expressed their frustration outside the Burnie Supreme Court following the sentence given to Boat Harbour man Andrew Denis Dare, 24. He bound a woman with a phone cord before raping her in her own bed. Dare was sentenced to five years prison, with a minimum of three years for the attack at Sisters Beach. He pleaded guilty last month to nine charges including rape, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated burglary and robbery. This court decision followed two other separate rape case sentences, involving a pregnant woman and two elderly victims, deemed too lenient by many Coasters. Mr Wierenga said he could summarise the frustrations of North-West police officers by saying they felt the sentences, particularly that given to Dare, as being "at the low end of the scale" and "too lenient". "We are in the process of setting up a meeting with the Attorney-General on a number of issues and that will be one of them," Mr Wierenga said. The sentencing concerns "increased the need" to meet Mr Kons to discuss various issues, he said. These could include workers compensation and criminal injuries compensation matters. Meanwhile, Director of Public Prosecutions Tim Ellis said yesterday he had 21 days to decide whether to appeal the Dare sentence. Mr Ellis said the matter was "still open", but he would not be drawn on whether he was considering any appeal. The maximum sentence for rape is 21 years jail. Factors considered in rape sentencing can include any weapons used in the assault, whether it was conducted alone and any guilty plea entered. http://www.theadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/rape-sentence-furore-police-want-kons-to-explain/198492.aspx|/images/andrew_dare_2.jpg

BOWMAN CHARLES DAVIDSON (QLD- Caboolture)|38 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Bowman Davidson - Violently raped a 17 yr old girl in 1999, at Cherboug in Qld. Bowman Charles Davidson sentenced to two-years jail but given immediate parole for assault on police officer- (19-7-2012) A VIOLENT career criminal who assaulted a police officer by dangling him over a 3.6m high balcony was today jailed for two years, but released on immediate parole. The Brisbane District Court was told grandfather Bowman Charles Davidson's attack on the officer was triggered when police called at his Caboolture home, on Brisbane's northern outskirts, to talk to him about evading a train fare. The court was told Davidson, 38, has a "terrible criminal record for violence" that had resulted in him being jailed on 11 separate occasions out of a total 19 convictions. Prosecutor Christopher Cooke said Davidson has a previous conviction for assaulting police, but that young women were almost always his main targets - including a 17-year-old girl who he violently raped at Cherboug, 265km northwest of Brisbane, in early 1999. Davidson on Thursday pleaded guilty to eight offences including serious assault of a police officer, evading a train fare, contravening a direction, obstructing police and possessing a dangerous drug. Mr Cook said police had gone to Davidson's home on August 21 last year to question him about giving a false name to police when he was issued with an infringement notice for evading a train fare. He said police had helped Davidson, who was caring for young children, to bring them into the house before trying to question him. The court was told Davidson then became very aggressive and was seen throw something - which police later established was a bag containing three grams of cannabis, off the balcony. Mr Cook said Davidson then grabbed one of two officers in a "bear hug" and wrestled with him until forcing the officer over the railing of the balcony - located 3.65m from the ground. "(The policeman) believed he was be to thrown off the balcony," Mr Cook said. The court was told Davidson did not let go of the officer, who was eventually rescued with the help of his police partner. Barrister Steve Kissick, for Davidson, said: "It is not contended that (my client) was in fact trying to throw him over the balcony." Judge Tony Rafter, SC, replied: "(Davidson has) a terrible criminal record for violence." "This must have been terrifying for the police officer." Mr Kissick asked his client not be incarcerated too long because Davidson wanted to spend time with his 86-year-old grandmother - who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness - at her home in Woorabinda, near Rockhampton. Judge Rafter, in sentencing Davidson, noted the incident had left the police officer emotionally traumatised. "(The officer) is a family man and he became seriously concerned about the welfare of his family," he said. http://www.news.com.au/national/bowman-charles-davidson-sentenced-to-two-years-jail-but-given-immediate-parole-for-assault-on-police-officer/story-fndo4ckr-1226430059875

Davis sexually assaulted an 89 yr old woman in her Portland home. Long Jail term for sex attacker- (26-3-2011) A Portland man who sexually assaulted an elderly woman in her home has received a lengthy jail sentence after appearing in the Sydney District Court this week. Wayne Bernard Davis, 61, was convicted by a jury in the District Court in Bathurst last September and appeared in the Downing Centre this week for sentencing before Judge Bennett. He was sentenced to a total 12 years jail with a non parole period of nine years on charges of enter dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence (sexual assault) and recklessly inflict actual bodily harm with intent to commit sexual assault. The victim in the matter was 89 years old at the time of the offence. In early evidence police said the elderly woman was alone in her Portland home on the night of August 28, 2008, when she answered a knock at her door. She was confronted by a man wearing a balaclava and gloves who forced his way into the house and physically and sexually assaulted the victim. The woman was later taken to Nepean Hospital for treatment. Davis continued to deny his guilt right throughout the subsequent proceedings but a majority verdict was returned by the jury in September after four days of deliberation. The victim gave evidence in a closed Court during the trial. The jury deliberated for four days and was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. Judge Bennett thanked the jury and said it had not been an easy trial for them, with challenging technical evidence to hear and comprehend. He said the majority verdict which had been returned was the correct one. He said there had been cogent and compelling DNA evidence submitted by the prosecution. The sentences were backdated to the time Davis was taken into custody last year. http://www.lithgowmercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/long-jail-term-for-sex-attacker/2114602.aspx

Sex attacker goes free (12-3-2011) A Bendigo chef who was coming off an alcohol and drug binge when he indecently assaulted two women has been told his actions will stay with the victims for their entire lives. Bradley Dean, 25, was sentenced to four months jail to be served as an intensive corrections order and three months jail wholly suspended for two years after he attacked a 15-year-old girl and a 20-year-old woman at bus shelters in Kennington. Dean, of Long Gully, pleaded guilty in Bendigo Magistrates Court yesterday to an indecent act with a child under 16 and one indecent assault. Prosecutor Leading Senior Constable Dave Somerton told the court that both assaults took place on August 24 in St Aidans Road. He said that at 8.20am the 15-year-old female victim was in her school dress waiting at a bus shelter near her home. Dean has approached the victim and stood in front of her. He rubbed the outside of her school dress against her vagina. Dean has then ran across St Aidans Road.

He then grabbed the womans breasts. The woman has screamed and the offender ran off, Leading Senior Constable Somerton said. The woman ran home traumatised and told her parents. When Dean was inter-viewed by police, he initially gave strong denials and a detailed alibi. Leading Senior Constable Somerton said Dean agreed to be in an identification parade and a positive identification was made. The police interview resumed and the accused admitted he was involved and responsible. He said Dean had consumed beer, marijuana and amphetamines throughout the night prior to the assaults. Defence lawyer Russell Kelly said Dean had been on a 10-hour binge with work colleagues at a Collins Court house. Mr Kelly said the offences were completely out of character for his client, who had no prior convictions. Magistrate Ian Watkins said the former Golden Square Hotel chefs Behaviour had caused significant fear in his victims, resulting in them feeling unsafe and being unable to travel on public transport alone. It goes to the very heart of women in Bendigo moving around freely and safely, he said. These victims will remember your conduct for their entire life.

PETER CHARLES DEERING (SA)|59 yrs old (2012)|Has spent almost 30 years in detention. To be detained indefinitely (10-1-2012).|Found guilty of four counts of rape in 1986. Victim was a 39 yr old woman. News (10-1-2012)- "'Send rapist Peter Charles Deering to a nursing home', court told"- A rapist who has spent almost 30 years in detention due to his uncontrollable sexual instincts should be in a nursing home, a court has heard. Today, lawyers for Peter Charles Deering, 59, told the Supreme Court their client was an old, ill man who likely posed no risk to the community. Barrister David Stokes said decisions must be made about Deering's future, given changes at Glenside Hospital. "In the long term, Glenside will cease to have open rehabilitation beds," he said. "It will be inappropriate for Deering to be held in a secure facility for young, difficult and volatile people (but) no nursing home will take him. "It's an appalling situation." In December 1986, Deering was found guilty of four counts of rape against a woman, 39. The year before, he forced his way into her Kurralta Park flat. He grabbed her by the hair, banged her head on the floor, threatened her with a knife and demanded sex. In sentencing, then-Justice Graham Prior said medical reports showed Deering was incapable of controlling his sexual instincts. "A case of this kind would, on its own, call for a sentence of imprisonment in excess of 10 years," he said. Because of Deering's medical issues, however, Justice Prior ordered he serve nine years' jail and be detained "at Her Majesty's pleasure" after that term had expired. Deering who attended court today under supervision has since made several failed applications for release. Today Pauline Barnett, prosecuting, asked the court to continue his detention indefinitely. "Age and ill health seem to have overtaken him and the chemical therapies appear to operate successfully, showing some signs of controlling aberrant behaviour," she said. "But it remains an open question as to whether he is willing to control his sexual urges. "One doctor is still of the opinion Deering presents some concern or risk to the community, and feels the detention should therefore continue." Mr Stokes said Deering's nurses had "no concerns" about him. "Of course, one cannot make guarantees," he said. "But that same doctor concludes his report by saying he believes it would be appropriate 'to explore the possibility of a nursing home'." However, he said he would not oppose the prosecution application "this time". Justice Trish Kelly said the reports indicated Deering could "never be discharged" due to his "incapacity to live independently". "It's a Catch-22 situation," she said. "I'm not going to say it's all or nothing because, next thing, there will be complaints he's running around beaches and children's playgrounds. "It seems to me you are both correct, but the interests of justice and of the community require me to accede to the prosecution's application." She ordered Deering remain in detention. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/send-rapist-peter-charles-deering-to-a-nursing-home-court-told/story-e6frea83-1226240669251 Thanks for voting!

HENDRICUS DE GRAAF (NSW- Forster)|yrs old|Sentenced in the Wonthaggi Magistrates Court, to 6 months jail - to serve 3 months, with 3 months suspended for 2 yrs.|Self employed painter and (Former??)treasurer of the Foster Golf Club..Pleaded guilty to possessing hundreds of images of child pornography. Magistrate Eddie Batt told de Graaf. "The people who are making these images are destroying young lives." Mr Batt told de Graff that many of the people who came to his court were the victims of child sexual abuse and the effects were devastating. - below- The Great Southern Star- News 2009- FOSTER resident Hendricus de Graaf pleaded guilty to possessing hundreds of images of child pornography, when he faced the Wonthaggi Magistrates Court last Friday. De Graaf will serve three months in prison with a further three months suspended for a period of two years. He will be placed on the national sex offenders register for eight years. The self-employed painter and treasurer of the Foster Golf Club, was raided at his home by police on Wednesday, April 8, of this year. A computer was seized, and a number of portable hard drives were taken away for analysis. The father of two sat stony-faced as the charges were read against him. "Many people believe this is a victimless crime. That's not the way the community at large sees this," magistrate Eddie Batt told de Graaf. "The people who are making these images are destroying young lives." Mr Batt told de Graff that many of the people who came to his court were the victims of child sexual abuse and the effects were devastating. De Graff's lawyer told the court his client had done much work for the local community and he would return to the town to "face the music". Two character references were supplied to the court by members of the golf club. While The Star knew about the circumstances of the case, it was urged to keep quiet until the case went to trial. Wonthaggi Police's Senior Constable Paul Burns was part of the sting. "We had those hard drives analysed, which showed there were about 200 images of child pornography and about 20 video files," he said. Snr Const Burns could not talk about the scope of the police investigation, but only that de Graaf was caught in a net that has been cast far and wide. "It was part of a bigger operation, but it's not something we can comment on. Basically it's just information we've been given and we then, as far as our investigation goes, seize computers and have them analysed," he said. "We executed a warrant on the man's house, seized his computers and had it confirmed they had child pornography on them." Police believe they are closer to making many more arrests as they explore the potential of software that tracks and indentifies the online communications of offenders. Simply put, the technology shows who is downloading child pornography. Despite having had access to the software for only a short time, police have already identified thousands of computers in Victoria that have downloaded child pornography. The computer hits are placed against Google maps to help locate offenders. Head of the Sexual Crimes Squad, Detective Inspector Glen Davies, told The Star it could not estimate how many people were downloading images of child pornography in Victoria, but said: "There's a fair prevalence of people involved in accessing and downloading images of child exploitation. "It's not a new tool (the software), but it's been used in Queensland fairly extensively and the US. We've just started using it now in Victoria and we've got plans to target specific areas, and we'll be rolling that out in some planned operations fairly shortly," he said. "It's pretty definitive, evidentiarywise. It allows us to explore the issues further. We'll take a search warrant and seize the materials and interview the suspects. It's a really good lead in for us. "There's various ways we can look at who suspects are communicating with. This tool will specifically pinpoint people who have downloaded specific images. There's other methods we use to verify and put together a picture of who people are communicating with." Det. Insp. Davies had a clear message for those who traded in child pornography online: "We've got extra tools now that help us locate it and if you've got the stuff on your computer you could find us knocking on your door."

In the NSW Supreme Court today, Brendan David Dennison, 26, pleaded guilty to 19 charges, including the murder of an 18-year-old Chinese student and reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm on her 19-year-old Korean boyfriend. He has also pleaded guilty to 10 counts of raping the couple and two other women present at knife-point, and four counts of illegally detaining them.

The woman died in the fall, which left her boyfriend with serious spinal injuries. Dennison appeared briefly in court, where he pleaded guilty to the charges. He had originally been facing 27 charges. Dennison is due to be sentenced on March 9 next year.

By the time he was 17, the violent urges had increased to the stage where the hulking 119kg Denyer began stalking women in the Frankston area. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/serial-killer-paul-charles-denyer-had-a-terrible-urge-to-kill/story-fnat7jnn-1226616059910 "Serial killer Paul Denyer defies prison order to stop dressing as woman" (9-4-2013) Sadistic serial killer Paul Denyer is blatantly flouting prison rules by wearing women's underwear and make-up behind bars.

But can how you write really paint an accurate picture of your personality, and your past? Skeptics put the interpretation of handwriting, known as graphology, on par with palm reading and astrology. But its practitioners are adamant your writing says much more about you than the words themselves. So the Herald Sun put graphology to the test with a series of letters penned by serial killer Paul Denyer from behind bars. Denyer was just 21 when he brutally murdered three women in the Frankston area in 1993, telling police he hated women and had the urge to kill. Experts found he was a sadistic narcissist  and unlikely to change. He had been in jail for a decade when he decided to begin living as a woman, claiming he had killed females because he was angry he was not one. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/special-handwriting-analysis-provides-an-insight-into-the-mind-of-serial-killer-paul-denyer/story-e6freuy9-1226616241995 News (8-5-2012)- "Cross-dressing serial killer accused of jail rape"- A Victorian serial killer who has taken to dressing as a woman in prison has been accused of raping a fellow inmate. Police have been granted permission to interview Paul Denyer over an alleged rape at Port Phillip Prison last month. Denyer appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court via video link today as police applied to interview him. He was dressed as a woman and twirling his long brown hair but refused to face the camera as police outlined allegations of rape against him, the ABC reports. The serial killer, who unsuccessfully applied to the court in 2004 for a sex change operation, is accused of raping an inmate at the prison last month after he gave him a massage. Denyer is serving three consecutive life sentences for the murders of three young women at Frankston, Victoria, in 1993. Police have been granted four hours to speak to him over the alleged rape. http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/8464016/cross-dressing-serial-killer-accused-of-jail-rape "Paul Denyer: The Frankston Serial Killer" Over a seven week period in the summer of 1993, three young women, ages 17, 18 and 22, were violently stabbed and slashed to death one in broad daylight, in and around Frankston, about a 40-minute drive from Melbourne on Port Phillip Bay in south eastern Victoria. Another 41-year-old woman was violently assaulted and considered herself lucky to escape with her life. None of the victims knew each other and there was nothing to connect them in any way except that they all lived in the Frankston district. After the first two murders and an assault in which the victim escaped, it became clear to police that there was a serial killer on the loose. The killer chose his victims at random and murdered for no apparent reason. Their theory was tragically proved correct when another young woman was murdered a short time later. And when he was eventually caught, the serial killer turned out to be a local, Paul Charles Denyer, a 6-foot, very overweight, 21-year-old man who answered to the nickname of John Candy, after the (now deceased) funnyman of such movies as Uncle Buck, The Blues Brothers and Cool Runnings. But Paul Denyer, the John Candy look-a-like serial killer was no funny man. He was a pudgy, dysfunctional misfit, an oafish character and self-confessed misogynist who was always going to be a monster. As a child he slit the throats of his sister's toy bears and grew up obsessed with blood and gore movies such as The Stepfather, Fear and Halloween, which he watched over and over. Paul Denyer was a beast who slit the throat of the family kitten with his brother's pocketknife and hung the dead animal from a tree branch. After his arrest for murder it was discovered that it was Denyer who had disemboweled a friend's cat and slit the throats of its kittens. Killing human beings was only a matter of time.http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/paul_denyer/1.html|/images/paul_denyer.jpg

Placed on the sex offenders' register for life.|Noureldin Derwish - Rapist-found guilty by a County Court jury of 13 counts of rape, two charges of false imprisonment and three counts of making threats to kill. "Obese 150kg rapist Noureldin Derwish lured victims with fake tales of wealth, underworld ties and links to Osama bin Laden" (10-12-2013) A morbidly obese rapist who threatened to kill the families of his victims if they didn't have sex with him has been jailed for eight years. Noureldin Derwish, 27, posed as an underworld heavyweight, international drug lord, and a multi-millionaire businessman when he lured his two young victims into his evil world of lies and sick fantasies. He also told one of his victims he knew where Osama bin Laden was living because of his significant international underworld connections. Both of Derwish's two victims complained that they had been left crushed under his hulking 150kg frame as he repeatedly raped them. He was found guilty by a County Court jury of 13 counts of rape, two charges of false imprisonment and three counts of making threats to kill. The court heard today His first victim, then a 17-year-old schoolgirl, was handcuffed to a bed in a Fawkner hotel after being raped and held captive for up to seven hours. She was then raped another three or four times. The young girl had been waiting for her sister at Flinders St station in September 2010 when Derwish, who called himself Ali, approached her and offered her drugs in exchange for sexual favours. She refused and gave Derwish a false name but he later contacted her on her mobile and told her she had to meet him. He threatened that his Egyptian mafia connections would become involved if she didn't comply. The pair met at Glenroy Station, where Derwish told her to pretend it was his birthday and that she was his girlfriend. He took the victim to the Formule 1 Hotel in Fawkner, where he said he had a gun and told her he had people planted in the hotel he could call if she didn't do what he said. He then raped her. After telling her to take a shower, because it was customary to wash after sex in his culture, he raped her again. The victim, who had grown increasingly fearful of Derwish, agreed to meet him again some days later. He had threatened to find her family and kill them if she told police, and again reminded her of his links to the Egyptian mafia. Derwish met his second victim, who was 23, in June 2011. After she rejected a false job offer at one of his strip clubs, he offered her a job working for his fictitious company. While negotiating details of the fake job, the victim repeatedly turned down requests to sleep with Derwish, including an offer of $3 million. Derwish later told his victim that he had not wanted to sleep with her, but was testing her to see if she was a suitable candidate for the job at the company. After the victim grew impatient with waiting to start her new job, Derwish, who went by the name Fernando, started to become aggressive. He told her he was an international cocaine importer and threatened to kill her entire family while making her watch. He also told the victim that his cousin was looking for a sex slave and had his eyes on her sister. He forced the woman to have unprotected sex on a string of occasions and to make two sex videos. Derwish shook his head as Judge Gabriele Cannon described the vile offending. She said both victims had been left with sustained psychological injuries and were scarred by the trauma of the offences. Judge Cannon said that while Derwish was significantly mentally impaired, the planning behind his offending showed a significant level of understanding of its seriousness. She said Derwish, who is incontinent and had been binge eating while being held in custody because of anxiety, had suffered bullying behind bars. They were factors, as well as his mental impairment, and the fact he would likely remain in protective custody, Judge Cannon said she considered when deciding an appropriate sentence. He was sentenced to 12 years and three months' imprisonment and could be eligible for release after eight years. He will be placed on the sex offenders' register for life. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/obese-150kg-rapist-noureldin-derwish-lured-victims-with-fake-tales-of-wealth-underworld-ties-and-links-to-osama-bin-laden/story-fni0fee2-1226779684710

The proposed changes to the Forensic Procedures Act means police could take DNA from children linked to a crime, but who are not suspects. Police have been lobbying for the change since late last year to help in their investigation against convicted sex offender Gary John Devine's alleged sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl. The girl alleged she had a long-term sexual relationship with Devine and that he fathered her child, born last August. The amendment would allow police to take a DNA sample from the baby boy to establish paternity. Devine, 51, is serving a 10-year prison sentence for his role in prostituting the girl's 12-year-old sister. http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/25/3149091.htm "Man who pimped girl, 12, jailed eight years" http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/man-who-pimped-girl-12-jailed-10-years/story-e6freuyi-1225845161584 "Man admits prostituting 12-year-old girl, sharing proceeds with mother" http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/man-admits-prostituting-12-year-old-girl- sharing-proceeds-with-mother/story-e6freuyi-1225844142623|/images/gary_john_devine_1.jpg

"Sex offender released under supervision" (2-10-2013) A dangerous sex offender in Perth who has been on anti-libidinal medication for two years has been granted release under a strict 10-year supervision order. Between 1990 and 1993, James Flavell Dick committed sexual offences against a girl and a boy, and re-offended against the same victims in 1998. He served two periods of imprisonment for the offences while allegations related to other alleged victims were dismissed, discontinued or overturned on appeal. After breaching the conditions of his release in 2009, the WA Supreme Court jailed Dick indefinitely. At his review last year, the court heard Dick had been taking anti-libidinal medication for about a year and it had resulted in a significant reduction of his testosterone levels, but he was still not ready for release. In his fourth annual review this week, Dick was granted release with 44 strict conditions including electronic monitoring, a curfew, no alcohol possession or consumption, and no unauthorised contact with anyone under the age of 18. He was also ordered not to have any contact with his children or grandchildren without their consent, must comply with rehabilitation programs, and continue his anti-libidinal treatment. "I am satisfied that the respondent has the willingness and ability to comply," Justice Stephen Hall said. The judge noted that in the past year, Dick continued with the anti-libidinal medication without any significant side-effects and responded positively to individual psychological counselling. "This has resulted in increased self-awareness and self-management skills," he said. "His risk of re-offending is considered to have reduced significantly and the ability for him to be effectively managed in the community has improved." Justice Hall also noted that suitable accommodation had also become available for Dick in the community. http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/wa/19216226/wa-sex-offender-released-under-supervision/

When the victim resisted, Oliver punched her three times in the face, causing her nose to bleed.

ALDO DiNATALE  (VIC- Werribee)|  65 yrs old (2011) | Served 6 months jail in 2008.   |Pleaded guilty to indecent assault/s. Victims were a boy, aged 7-9 yrs, and a girl aged 10-11 yrs. News (25-10-2011)- "Werribee paedophile defaults"- CONVICTED paedophile and prominent Werribee businessman Aldo DiNatale has not met a court-imposed deadline to pay almost $180,000 compensation to his two victims. He now faces bankruptcy. DiNatale was served with a bankruptcy notice by lawyers Schembri & Co on June 23 requiring him to pay $176,477.80 or make arrangements to settle the debt within 21 days (by July 12). He did not do so and proceedings have begun in the Federal Magistrates Court to have him declared bankrupt. DiNatale pleaded guilty in 2008 to indecently assaulting Nick, now aged 46, from age seven to nine between 1971 and 1973. DiNatale also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting a female. Now 65, DiNatale was sentenced to two years jail on each count on May 29, 2008, with an effective sentence of eight months. Judge Wilmoth suspended 17 months of the jail term for two years, bringing the effective jail time down to 15 months. In May last year, Judge Wilmoth ordered DiNatale to pay each of his two victims $80,000 compensation for pain and suffering. A tax return submitted to the County Court in May last year when his victims first pursued their compensation claim shows his taxable income for the 2009-10 financial year was just $35,000. Judge Wilmoth noted: He is one of a number of directors of several corporate entities involved in property development but there is no other evidence available to me as to his financial circumstances. However, she also noted that he has been described in some of the depositional material as a man of means, as a successful businessman in the field of property development. DiNatale referred the Leader to his lawyers when contacted about his failure to pay compensation to his victims. http://wyndham-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/werribee-paedophile-defaults/|/images/aldo_dinatale_2.jpg

No time in prison for child porn (19-7-2012) An Ipswich man's obsession with adult pornography led him into the seedy underworld of online child rape and torture. Peter John Doherty, 57, was caught with 180 images of female infants and children being raped, tortured and forced into bestiality when police raided his home in July last year. Ipswich District Court was told Doherty had a "breakdown" during 2007. He took time off work, and spent his time at home browsing the internet. While downloading adult porn, which was his primary interest, Doherty stumbled across "unsafe sites" which led him to develop an interest in child porn. When police seized his computer, officers discovered 180 child porn images among a plethora of adult porn. Defence barrister Steve Kissick argued the images were on the "lighter end of the scale" and when caught, Doherty had purchased a new computer and was in the process of deleting all images from his old computer. Mr Kissick said Doherty had an excellent work history, and there was little chance of him offending again. The court heard Doherty was a valued member of the community and was already taking steps to rehabilitate himself. Doherty was sentenced to 15 months' prison, released immediately, and entered into a $2000 recognisance for three years. Judge Deborah Richards said child pornography was a "scourge worldwide" and difficult to detect, meaning police spent many hours investigating offenders. Judge Richards said she was confident Doherty would not offend again, as his primary interest was adult porn. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/no-time-in-prison-for-child-porn/1458531/
ANTHONY JAMES DONOVAN (QLD)|50 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in 1995 to 14 yrs jail.|Anthony Donovan raped a female taxi driver at knife point in 1994. News (6-6-2011)- "Released rapist sent back to jail as supervision order rescinded"- A SEX offender who raped a female taxi driver at knife point and later forced a fellow prisoner to perform oral sex on him is back in jail after having his strict community supervision order rescinded. Attorney-General Paul Lucas went to the Supreme Court in Brisbane seeking to cancel the supervised release order which was made under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders ) Act 2003, last August. Justice David Boddice agreed and Anthony James Donovan was returned to serving an indefinite sentence yesterday. He noted Donovan argued while he had breached his orders shortly after release he could be treated appropriately which would be adequate protection for the community. However, Justice Boddice said he was not satisfied the conditions of the release order would protect the community having regard to Donovan's behaviour when released. "The fact additional programs could be undertaken in the community does not negate the risk to the community while those programs are being completed," Justice Boddice said. He said Donovan was a high risk of reoffending and his supervision order of August 2010 should be rescinded. Justice Boddice ordered Donovan be detained in custody indefinitely for care and treatment. Donovan, 50, had spent most of his life in jail since 1983. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/released-rapist-sent-back-to-jail-as-supervision-order-rescinded/story-e6freoof-1226069861379

GEOFFREY DOOLAN (QLD - Townsville)|47 yrs old (2013)|Geoffrey Doolan has 14 sexual offence convictions, mainly involving approaching young people under 18 years of age in public while drunk and asking them for sex, over 20 years. "The absence of a more serious sexual offence, such as rape, is probably due to his extreme intoxication, giving the victims a reasonable chance of escape," Justice Applegarth said. Most recently, he indecently treated two brothers, aged 12 and 13, in the toilet of a hotel. A 14-year-old girl was sick and started retching after Doolan grabbed her and kissed her on the lips while she waited for a school bus in Mackay. He was sentenced to 12 months for that attack. Doolan had previously received three months in jail for kissing a woman, 36, and asking her for sex outside an ATM in Rockhampton. He also received six months in jail for grabbing a 22-year-old woman's breasts and squeezing them in 1996, 15 months before putting his hand up the skirt of a 13-year-old girl outside a cinema in 2000; 12 months for grabbing a woman, 23, and making a sexual suggestion in 2001 - all in Townsville.|Geoffrey Doolan - Paedophile/ Repeat Offender..Most recently, he indecently treated two brothers, aged 12 and 13, in the toilet of a hotel. "Accused paedophile detained indefinitely due to risk factor" (4-5-2013) A Supreme Court justice had labelled a North Queensland pedophile with a proclivity for groping and propositioning young people for sex in public as a "serious danger to the community". Justice Peter Applegarth released his reasons on Friday for detaining Geoffrey Doolan indefinitely, noting any return to alcohol "would create an imminent risk" and his prospects of abstaining were "very poor". He said the 47-year-old, who was supposed to be released from custody this weekend, was not suitable for a supervision order. "Once intoxicated, sexual offending would be likely to occur soon afterwards," he said. "A likely scenario is that he will become drunk and touch, grope or threaten females or males, either children or adults. "His behaviour would be sexually motivated and disinhibited by intoxication. "The expert opinion is that his conduct is unlikely to escalate to serious sexual violence or life-threatening violence." Justice Applegarth said there might be hope a supervision order would allow authorities to quickly detect any return to alcohol abuse before he committed a sexual offence. But he said the chronic alcoholism, lack of insight into his offending and its consequences for his victims, and his past persistent offending created a significant risk he would re-offend before detection. When Doolan, 47, is not in prison, he gets drunk daily. He has 14 sexual offence convictions, mainly involving approaching young people under 18 years of age in public while drunk and asking them for sex, over 20 years. "The absence of a more serious sexual offence, such as rape, is probably due to his extreme intoxication, giving the victims a reasonable chance of escape," Justice Applegarth said.

"'Depraved' man groomed children" (21-11-2011) Sexually explicit language used to lure children as young as 11 over the internet by a 46-year-old former bus driver was described as heinous by a judge on Friday. Phillip Mark Douglas pleaded guilty in the Rockhampton District Court to five counts of using a carriage service to groom someone under the age of 16, one count of transmitting child pornography and one count of sexual assault. Judge Gregory Koppenol, in handing down sentences for the crimes, described the offences as very serious. "The conversations were explicit," he said. "I regard your actions as depraved. I think you humiliated and embarrassed these young girls and, in some instances, continued your sexual conversations with them for your own sexual gratification. "Offences involving child pornography are heinous offences which are rightly condemned by the community." Crown Prosecutor Dearne Galbraith told the court Taskforce Argos, the Queensland-based police squad that deal with child pornography and child groomers, monitored Mr Douglas' computer usage between April 28, 2009 and May 11, 2009, during which time the taskforce contacted him using a pseudonym. She said after Douglas transmitted 11 category one images, police executed a search warrant and found, on Douglas' computer, chat conversations with five girls, one which had identified as living in the Netherlands. "We can't suggest it was definitely a child," Ms Galbraith said. "It certainly wasn't a Queensland covert officer." Three of the chatters claimed they were 11 years old, one claimed they were 12 and the other claimed she was 15. She said this case was different to other child grooming cases in that usually one child was groomed by an offender over a long period of time. "Most chats with the girls were two or three chats over a period of 20 months, and totalling some six and a half hours," Ms Galbraith said. Defence Barrister Jeff Clarke said his client was close to his sister and mother, but not his brothers, and that he suffered significant social isolation. "He's never had a significant relationship with a member of the opposite sex," he said. Douglas received three-year prison-term sentences, with parole eligibility after 12 months, for six of the offences and 12 months for the other offence. He will also be subject to a three-year good behaviour term and two years probation, once released from jail. Douglas will serve his sentences concurrently. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/man-lures-girls-on-internet/1179794/
ADRIAN PAUL DOWDLE (Adrian Dowdle) (VIC- Wangaratta)|31 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced to be updated.|Adrian Paul Dowdle- Using a carriage service to transmit an indecent communication to a person under 16, and 2 counts of failing to comply with the Sex Offenders Act.. There was a further breach of sex register conditions when Dowdle was seen with a boy, 14, in January - 2012. Facebook bid to lure young girl (26-1-2013) A Wangaratta man with intellectual impairment will be on the Victorian sex offender register for 15 years after contacting a girl, 14, on Facebook suggesting she visit him. Adrian Paul Dowdle was already on the register for attempted bestiality when he made repeated attempts to get the girl to go to Wangaratta with sexual inferences. He was found out when the communications between them were seen by someone and reported to the girls mother, who contacted police. Dowdle, 31, appeared in custody in the County Court at Wodonga yesterday for sentencing on a charge of using a carriage service to transmit an indecent communication to a person under 16 and two counts of failing to comply with the Sex Offenders Act. Judge Marilyn Harbison said specialist reports indicated Dowdle had limited capacity to understand the implications of restrictions put on him. She said a forensic psychiatrist had described Dowdle as being moderately disabled. Dowdle had been involved in the attempted bestiality of a dog some years ago. It was an act of idiocy, but it carries automatic registration as a sex offender, she said. The act was videod by your brother and circulated to his friends. Dowdle was severely ostracized, suffers social isolation and the video is still circulating. It is clear from the plea that you urgently need supervision, Judge Harbison said. Dowdle was convicted in November 2007 for attempted bestiality and put on the sex register. He was 29 when the Facebook communication was made with the girl in November 2010. There was a further breach of sex register conditions when Dowdle was seen with a boy, 14, in January last year. There is no suggestion there was any inappropriate contact or talk, Judge Harbison said. She said the prosecution had conceded that a community corrections order was appropriate along with a justice plan. Dowdle was convicted on the two charges of failing to comply with sex offender conditions, but no further action as taken. He was put on a three-year community corrections order on the other charge and ordered to attend sex offender programs as directed. http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1259877/facebook-bid-to-lure-young-girl/?cs=11

JASON ALEXANDER DOWNIE (SA)|20 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 17-4-2012, to Life in jail - 35 yrs non parole.|Triple Murderer/ Rapist. Pleaded guilty to murdering Andrew, Rose and Chantelle Rowe at their home in Kapunda, in November 2010. He broke into the Rowe home, killed Chantelle's father Andrew, then her mother Rose and then raped Chantelle, 16, and stabbed her to death. He stabbed Chantelle more than 33 times, Andrew at least 29 times and Rose more than 50 times. News (17-4-2012)- "Kapunda killer Jason Alexander Downie sentenced to 35 years jail for murder of Andrew, Rose and Chantelle Rowe"- Justice John Sulan this morning jailed Jason Alexander Downie for life, with a 35-year non-parole period, for the November 2010 murders in Kapunda, north of Adelaide. More than 100 friends and family of the Rowes listened, wept and shouted abuse at Downie as Justice Sulan said words could not adequately describe the murders and their impact, AdelaideNow reports. They were caught off-guard, however, when his sentencing remarks went into further graphic detail about the murders. "Andrew Rowe was either awake or somehow became aware of an intruder ... when you (Downie) made a noise, he was alerted to your presence," Justice Sulan said. He said Downie grabbed a knife from the family's kitchen, confronted Mr Rowe and stabbed him 10 to 15 times, then once more in the back as he turned away. Rose Rowe, he said, was the next to die. "You killed (her) simply because she witnessed your attack on her husband," he said. After stabbing Mrs Rowe 50 times, Downie followed Chantelle into her bedroom - she was hiding under her bed. "You stabbed her two or three times, pulled her out from under the bed ... she must have been terrified by what she had seen," he said. Thinking she was dead, Downie removed her clothes and, when she regained consciousness, he ran to the kitchen to get another knife. Justice Sulan said Downie then resumed stabbing Chantelle and, when she "became weak", raped her. His recounting of those events sparked outrage in the courtroom, with Chantelle's family members yelling "you will die" and "they are going to have you" at Downie. Two women ran from the court in tears, while a third had to use an asthma puffer. After calling for quiet - and threatening to remove people from court - Justice Sulan resumed sentencing. He said he rejected Downie's claims he had gone to the Rowe house to confront Chantelle's boyfriend, of whom he was jealous. "I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was your intention to make sexual advances toward Chantelle Rowe and to have sexual intercourse with her," he said. "I am satisfied you held an attraction toward her (but) any relationship (between you) other than that of a friend was a figment of your desire and imagination, rather than fact. "I am satisfied Chantelle Rowe did not encourage you, nor did she at any time become engaged in a relationship with you." He said Downie's personal history did not exhibit "any of the criminological characteristics" of typical defendants. "The murders of three innocent victims must carry with it a severe sentence," he said. "I do not accept that your conduct was of someone who was not thinking rationally. "The cold-blooded, merciless attack on Chantelle, who had hidden under the bed in fear, was a chilling act." Justice Sulan said Downie's non-parole period would have been 42 years, if not for his guilty pleas and prospects of rehabilitation. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/kapunda-killer-jason-alexander-downie-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-murder-of-rowe-family/story-fn7x8me2-1226329817862|/images/jason_downie_2.jpg

News (18-1-2007)- "Search for molester at Sarina"- POLICE were last night searching for serial child molester Raymond Phillip Downs at Sarina. They were acting on information suggesting Downs was travelling south from Bakers Creek to Sarina. If he was in the area without informing the relevant authorities, it would be a breach of his parole conditions, a police spokesman said last night. Downs has family in Mackay and there were widespread rumours he had returned to live in Marian after he was released from Wolston Correctional Centre in February 2005. The suggestion he had returned then attracted concern and anger throughout the community. He is believed to have been living in Brisbane recently. His criminal history includes a string of sex offences against pre-pubescent girls dating back to 1974. Last night's police search began just after 6pm and continued well into the evening. Taxi drivers were also on alert for anyone matching Downs's description.  http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2007/01/18/apn-search-for-molester-at/ News (1-3-2005)- "Town on edge"- RUMOURS that serial child molester Raymond Phillip Downs is living at Marian, 27km west of Mackay, have the entire town on edge. Residents said if they found out Downs, 48, was in fact living in their midst, they would do whatever it took to make him leave. The trouble is, no-one can confirm exactly where he is. Downs was released from Wolston Correction Centre in Brisbane last week and it was confirmed he flew into Mackay last Friday. Marian police Sergeant Dan Graham said while police were privy to his whereabouts so he could be moni- tored, they were not at liberty to divulge any information to the media or the general public. Sgt Graham said he could not comment about the matter. And that has residents fuming. They believe they have a right to know whether there is a child molester in their community. Most residents were too frightened to speak on the record ? they were afraid they or their children could be targeted.  http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2005/03/01/apn-town-on/
RONALD JAMES DOWNS (QLD)|50 yrs old (2012) |To be updated. Due for release May 13 (2008).|Paedophile. Repeat Offender. News (8-5-2008)- "Govt loses bid to keep pedophile behind bars"- A serial pedophile has been approved for release into the community after Queensland's attorney-general yesterday lost a bid to keep him in jail. Ronald James Downs, 46, has been in jail since November 14, 2005, after pleading guilty to unlawful carnal knowledge of a child under 12. Prior to that he had served two other jail sentences for sexual offences against children. The first was in October 1980 and involved attempted intercourse with a three-year-old boy, for which he received six months' in jail. Downs was jailed again in November 1999 for two years' for six counts of indecently dealing with a girl who was aged four and six at the time of the offences. In a hearing in the Supreme Court in Brisbane late last month, Attorney-General Kerry Shine applied to have Downs kept under a continuing detention order, arguing he represented a serious danger to the community. But this argument was today rejected by Justice Martin Daubney, who ordered Downs - who was identified by a psychiatrist as being a high risk for repeat offending - be released under a 37-point 15-year community-based supervision order. Justice Daubney said, in his written judgment, that he had made the decision after carefully weighing the "paramount consideration of the need to ensure adequate protection of the community against (Downs's) entitlement to liberty". The supervision order requires Downs to abide by strict reporting conditions and prohibits him from consuming alcohol or illegal drugs. Downs will also be required to undertake counselling, and he is banned from being within 100m of schools during school travelling hours. He also is banned from visiting public parks without prior written permission, and must submit to electronic monitoring. Downs will be released on May 13. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/govt-loses-bid-to-keep-pedophile-behind-bars/2008/05/07/1210131059571.html News (15-11-2005)- "Judge jails child molester again for reoffending"- A PSYCHIATRIST had warned that a Mackay child molester was likely to reoffend and he did by having sex with a 12-year-old intellectually disabled girl. "The psychiatrist had that view in 1999 - and he was correct," Judge Julie Dick, SC, said in the District Court yesterday. Ronald James Downs, 44, disability pensioner, pleaded guilty to unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 16 at the Gold Coast in 2002. "What I'd like to do is to make some sort of order to keep you from children but I cannot (by law) do that," Judge Dick said. "Some people would say to lock you up and throw away the key, but I can't do that either." Crown prosecutor Nigel Rees said Downs had sex with the intellectually disabled girl while he was living on the Gold Coast with the girl's mother. Downs knew she was 12, Mr Rees said. His case was referred to the Mental Health Tribunal but he was found to be fit to stand trial. The court was told Downs attended a special school when he was young and could not read or write. He was convicted in 1999 of indecent treatment of a child and was jailed for two years on that occasion. Judge Dick said all she could do was to impose a jail sentence that would be a personal deterrent to Downs. She jailed him for two and a half years with no recommendation for early release. http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2005/11/15/apn-judge-jails-child-molester-again-for/

In July, a jury found Philip Doyle, 69, guilty of offences against five boys aged under 16 between 1980 and 2003 and he was sentenced to seven years' jail. The court heard the offences occurred in a projection room, in cinema toilets, in the candy bar store room and when Doyle drove some of his victims home or took them to his unit. During his sentencing, District Court Judge Greg Woods said Doyle used his position of authority to groom and assault his victims. "'He was a charming man, able to influence boys and was able to get on well with their parents," he said. Doyle, from Sans Souci in Sydney's south, was given the sentence with a non-parole period of four-and-a-half years, meaning he could be eligible for parole in 2017. He was acquitted of 21 charges involving two other boys in another trial. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Lloyd Babb SC, has directed that there be an appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence. The matter is back in court later this month. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-04/cinema-paedophile-sentence/4242132

FRANCIS ROBERT DRAKE (aka- Unc) (VIC- Maryborough)|yrs old|To be updated.|Francis Drake- Deceased/ Convicted paedophile. Suspects of interest in the Floyd case (5-2-2012) Police offered a $5000 reward on January 30, 1976, for information about Terry Floyds disappearance. The figure of the reward remained the same for more than 34 years. Police launched a new appeal for information in December 2010, lifting the reward to $100,000 for information that would solve the mystery case. Detectives spoke with more than 200 people before a Coronial inquest in 2001. Coroner Francis Hender found on November 29, 2001, that Terry had died from unknown causes at an unknown place and an unknown time. Two men have been central in the police investigation. The first was Francis Robert Drake, a trainer with the Maryborough Rovers and also known as the Unc. Drake, a convicted paedophile who detailed other incidents with young boys in a police interview, was initially thought to have abducted, abused and killed Terry. Investigators believe Terry told people the Unc was going to pick him up at 4.30pm and drive him back to Maryborough. Further investigations later found Drake was at his sisters place when Terry is believed to have disappeared. If it wasnt for Terry being 10 minutes late to the pick-up point, none of this would have happened, Daryl Floyd said. A second convicted paedophile, Raymond Kenneth Jones, is another person police believe might have played a role in Terrys disappearance. Jones, who now lives near Mildura, served time for indecently assaulting a boy in a Ballarat toilet block. Investigation records show renowned forensic psychiatrist Alan Bartholomew identified Jones had issues with young boys and potential murderer characteristics in 1975. Dr Bartholomew twice interviewed Jones in prison after he was charged for the Ballarat incident. His report, which went to the County Court a month after Terrys disappearance, stated the fact must remain that the prisoner is potentially dangerous and likely to remain so for some time. Jones was on bail, staying at Maryborough and drove a 1969 fawn-coloured Holden panel van at the time of Terrys disappearance. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/suspects-of-interest-in-the-floyd-case/2443996.aspx

DIETER DRESEN (German National)|yrs old|To be updated.|Rape- Indecent Assault and conduct endangering life. Dresen was deported back to Germany in August 2011. News (18-9-2011)- A Federal government blitz on foreign-born criminals has led to the deportation of 270 offenders - among them sex predators and cold-blooded murderers. Leading the crusade is Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, who reveals he has personally revoked the visas of 17 convicted criminals to ensure the "community remains protected". "These are very serious crimes committed by non-citizens," Mr Bowen told The Sunday Telegraph. "This is a significant discretionary power and it is one that I take very seriously to protect the Australian community from any potential harm - as the community would expect." Of the 270 convicted crooks who have been given their marching orders in the past few years, most have been long-time residents. Now, their visas have been stamped "never to return". Under the Migration Act, the Immigration Minister has discretionary powers to intervene and refuse or cancel a visa on character grounds. "Once a visa is cancelled the person becomes an unlawful non-citizen and must be removed from Australia as soon as reasonably possible," said the minister. The majority of offenders have been transported to Britain, prompting angry backlashes from the UK government saying it costs more than $100,000 to monitor and house each deportee. "In law, they don't belong here. They are tied to Britain by birth, but whether they are a citizen of the country is a different argument." In April, Clifford Tucker, a British citizen who has lived in Australia for more than 40 years, lost his legal fight not to be deported on character grounds. His lawyers had argued it was a breach of his human rights because he had grown up in Australia. Away from the UK, New Zealand is the destination of many of the "unwanted list" including sex killer Gerald Adamson, who was deported last month. He was convicted of manslaughter and the sexual assault of 21-year-old Lisa King, who died at an exclusive party in 2001. The case sparked front-page headlines after it was revealed that the party, at the home of Canterbury Leagues general manager John Ballesty, was also attended by the former Prime Minister John Howard's son Tim. Mr Howard's son, who did not know the victim, later provided a statement to police. Others include self-confessed "spiritual healer" Dieter Dresen, who was transported to Germany last month after convictions for rape, indecent assault and conduct endangering life. His treatments included lying naked on women to "absorb negative energy" and drugging clients with herbal potions. Rapist Lesley Neil Cunliffe, who tortured and imprisoned his victim in a Geelong dungeon that police described as straight out of Silence Of The Lambs, has also been declared an unlawful non-citizen. Cunliffe's visa was cancelled in June and he is currently in detention awaiting deportation after launching a legal bid against the ruling. Mr Bowen told The Sunday Telegraph he had cancelled 17 visas in the past year, had refused two and warned one individual. New Zealander Rangi Muir was sent home in June after he was convicted of two counts of rape involving his 12-year-old stepdaughter. Karl Koch, who was jailed in 2009 for serious violent offences against a previous partner, will "go from prison to plane for removal" after his visa was cancelled last month, according to the department. He is due for release from prison in 2012. Mark Walding Turner will also be deported to New Zealand when he completes a 10-year jail sentence next year. The laws remain controversial, with the UN Human Rights Committee complaining they breach international obligations, particularly when those people have strong family ties in Australia. Criminals with children who live in Australia have a better chance of staying because the minister must consider the best interests of children involved and must also consider the impact of any deportation on children. Opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison said the Coalition strongly backed the tough laws. "People on visas are here as our guests and if you break the rules you should be sent back," he said. "For people who abuse the welcome mat, they should face the consequences." Many criminals have turned to the courts to appeal against these decisions. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/our-least-wanted-criminals-are-being-deported-by-the-federal-government/story-e6freuy9-1226139953591|/images/dieter_dresen_2.jpg
DALE JOHN DREW (SA)|57 yrs old |Sentenced in 1995 to 6.5 yrs non parole. |Victim was a 21 yr old woman tied up by drew and sexually assaulted repeatedly over 3 days
MICHAEL DREW (NSW) |57 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in June 2013, in the Sydney's Downing Centre to 13 yrs jail - 6.5 yrs non parole.|Michael Drew - Child molester and Catholic school teacher/ netball coach - Sacked from St Agnes' Catholic Primary School in Matraville in 1982..One count of committing an act of indecency on a girl aged under 16, six counts of sexual intercourse with a person under 16 and 12 counts of assault and commit an act of indecency on a female aged under 16. The judge said Drew was using fellow students to take notes to other teachers to excuse the girls from class so he could molest them. "By then he was at the height of his powers," JW said "He was on a rampage, sexually assaulting us in front of the class, pulling kids out of other classes. "No one stopped them." -below. News (22-6-2013) - "Authorities took 'no action' against abuse of 'vulnerable young girls' - judge" - The victims of a serial child molester, a Catholic school teacher, say the church and school authorities knew of the abuse - and did nothing to stop it. A Sydney lawyer has called for charges to be laid against the Catholic Church and some of the former principals of a Catholic primary school after one of its teachers was this week sentenced for molesting girls as young as eight. Documents obtained by news.com.au show the school's principal at the time of the offences knew the details of the sexual assaults and actively decided to cover them up rather than go to police. Jason Parkinson, the solicitor representing the victims, says charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice may be able to be laid against school authorities at the time of the offences and against church officials who knew of the cases. Mr Parkinson's call comes after the sentencing judge criticised the school and church authorities for allowing girls at the school to be sexually assaulted by the teacher who "took away their lives". He took away their innocence and trust. He took away the lives they had, and the lives they could have had," Judge Donna Woodburne said in sentencing Michael Drew to 13 years prison. Drew, now 57, was sacked from St Agnes' Catholic Primary School in Matraville in 1982, but his crimes against girls dated back to as early as 1979. His dismissal papers stated: "It has been confirmed that you have been touching private parts of the body of girls at school. Because of the seriousness of these acts, after consultation with the Director of Education Brother (WXS), I have no other alternative as your employer but to summarily dismiss you for misconduct. "While at this point of time we don't intend pressing charges against you we must warn you that we have witnesses that include the children involved and their parents." Mr Parkinson told news.com.au there was a "real case" for others to be charged. "If the children of today and tomorrow are to be protected, then (everyone) who covered up the child abuse must be brought before a court." On Friday, Drew was sentenced in Sydney's Downing Centre to a minimum of six years and six months for one count of committing an act of indecency on a girl aged under 16, six counts of sexual intercourse with a person under 16 and 12 counts of assault and commit an act of indecency on a female aged under 16. Outside the court, the victims of the former teacher and netball coach wept and demanded action from the church and Prime Minister Julia Gillard. In an exclusive interview, they told how the teacher's "rampage" of blatant sexual abuse had ruined their lives and said they were outraged the Church had decided to cover it up. "We are calling on Julia Gillard and the Catholic Church to do something about the people who did nothing to stop this abuse," said one victim, referred to as JW to protect her identity. She attempted suicide at St Agnes because of Drew's sexual assaults on her and when this was reported to the school's principal, the head nun told her it was "a sin" to take one's own life. "We call on the Catholic Church to stop excusing itself and do something real to make this change," she said. "It's all very well for Cardinal (George) Pell to get up and say they didn't know about it. "In our case the school knew, the Catholic Education office knew and they decided not to go to police." In court, Judge Woodburne said Drew had embarked on a "systematic course of abuse on vulnerable young girls" over four years. She said the offences had been "brought to the attention of authorities who took no action at all", and that an earlier court hearing of Drew's abuse of one of the girls noted the "inaction of the school which can only serve to increase the suffering of the victims". Judge Woodburne related the stories of six of Drew's victims when he began a "sustained course of criminality" against students at St Agnes. She outlined the details of the 19 instances of sexual assault and intercourse with his students. Drew customarily called one of the girls to the front of the class and ordered them to stand next to him while he put his hand inside their uniform and sexually assaulted them. When a girl refused to come to the front of the class, he punished her by making her stay back during the lunch hour alone with him while he assaulted her. He also took children to his home, a Catholic Church property near the school, and assaulted them there and showed them pornography, or took them to the sports shed to assault them. The judge said Drew was using fellow students to take notes to other teachers to excuse the girls from class so he could molest them. "By then he was at the height of his powers," JW said "He was on a rampage, sexually assaulting us in front of the class, pulling kids out of other classes. "No one stopped them." Judge Woodhouse told the stories of JW and her sister, TW, and how their lives had been ruined by Drew's assaults which had escalated when their mother was put in hospital following a car accident. She said JW had been a "happy young girl" before she started at St Agnes with her younger brother and sister, TW, who was five years the girl's junior. The judge said Drew had "exploited the naiveties and youth" of the girls by befriending them, walking them home and, after their mother was admitted to hospital, taking advantage of their freedom to lure them in with "treats" and assault them. "JW went from a happy young girl to a frightened and isolated young child (who thought) the only way to stop what was happening was to take her own life. JW raided the school's medicine cabinet for pills and when, by recess, she needed help, she was "taken to the principal's office, yelled at and told it was a sin to take her own life". "When she responded with what the accused had done to her and said that was a sin, the principal told her to say nothing." Judge Woodburne said after the younger sister, TW, witnessed Drew's sexual assault of others in class, "she blamed herself for not telling an adult". TW was then herself assaulted. "From then on she had a lot of sick days because she was fearful of the offender," Judge Woodburne said. "She found it difficult to cope with schoolwork ... she became anorexic due to anxiety and not able to fulfil her dream of becoming a nurse." TW suffered post traumatic stress disorder, took to marijuana and cigarettes, alcohol, left school early and ended up in an abusive relationship. The judge said she was now "a poorly educated single mother of five with little prospect of changing her socio-economic standards". The judge said JW had also suffered. Outside the court, JW and her mother, FW, told the story of how the two girls had "gone off the rails" without either of their parents knowing the truth. "He nearly destroyed my life," JW, now 45, said. "It's only really now I've started to come out of the pain and the darkness. "I wonder how different my life would have been if not for his abuse. It's been 30 years of pain and misery. "After trying to commit suicide, I didn't feel safe at school. I went through years of alcohol and drug abuse. "I got into an abusive relationship and got pregnant at 17. I lost my relationship with my mother. "I was promiscuous. I was drowning my pain in drinking and ecstasy, cocaine and speed." JW's sister was going down a similar path and their mother could not understand what had gone wrong. "I just didn't know," FW said, weeping outside the court. "I felt like I had failed as a mother." Three years ago, JW's brother ran into another of Drew's victims, which led to a strange reunion and a decision to finally take him to court for what he had done. JW and her sister told their mother and it was like a "bombshell". "You don't know you've been living a lie," FW said. Now the mother and daughter and the other victims say they are happy with the sentence, but they want justice for the school and church authorities who covered up the crimes. "We'll never get our lives back," JW said, "but something has to happen to the people who allowed this to happen." Justice Woodburne told the court the "damage and the long-term psychological consequences and emotional harm" of the offences on the victims were substantial. "The childhoods of the victims were stolen from them and the course of their lives were forever changed because they had the misfortune to begin the class of Mr Drew or in his netball team," she said. http://mobile.news.com.au/national-news/authorities-took-8216no-action8217-against-abuse-of-8216vulnerable-young-girls8217-8212-judge/story-fncynjr2-1226667974562
AIDEN HARVEY DRIVER (SA)|20 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 17-6-2011 in the SA Supreme Court to 16 yrs jail - 10-yrs non-parole. In November 2011 the Court of Criminal Appeal reduced his sentence to 11 yrs - 5.5 yrs non-parole.|Linear Park Rapist- Raped one woman in her home and attacked two more on the banks of the River Torrens in SA. Pleaded guilty to numerous charges including rape, indecent assault and home invasion. News (12-11-2011)- "Linear Park rapist's sentence cut"- THE Linear Park sex offender's jail term has been cut by five years due to his youth and "cognitive difficulties". In September, the Court of Criminal Appeal flagged its intent to reduce Aiden Driver's 16-year jail term on the grounds that it was "manifestly excessive". Yesterday it reduced his sentence to 11 years, with a 5 -year non-parole period. Driver, 20, pleaded guilty to offences including indecent assault, rape and home invasion. His offending began at West Hindmarsh in May 2009, when he was aged 18. After breaking into a home, he placed his arm over the throat of its female occupant. She later told police she believed she "was going to die". Driver raped the woman three times before fleeing the scene. In July 2009, Driver attacked a woman who was walking her dogs at Linear Park, Felixstow. Three hours later, Driver attacked a woman at Vale Park. The woman managed to alert passersby, which eventually led to Driver's arrest. That victim told the court Driver had stolen her sense of freedom. Sentencing Driver in September, Justice Michael David said Driver "needed to be brought under control". "One of the characteristics of your offending is that you have no understanding of the state of mind, position or fear of these women," he said. "In other words, you do not have any empathy for them." Yesterday, in a unanimous decision, Justices Tom Gray, John Sulan and Malcolm Blue reduced Driver's sentence. In their co-written judgment, they noted his limited cognitive capacity and poor communication skills. Justice David, they said, gave those problems "insufficient weight" when arriving at his penalty. They considered 11 years an appropriate sentence. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/linear-park-rapists-sentence-cut/story-e6frea83-1226192854913 http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/linear-park-rapist-aiden-diver-jailed-for-16-years/story-fn6ck4a4-1226076709446 http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/river-torrens-linear-park-rapist-aiden-harvey-driver-finally-unmasked/story-e6frea83-1226066436884|/images/aiden_driver_1.jpg

He tried to kidnap a 15 yr old girl,at Prospect in November 2010. Fortunately the girl escaped after punching him repeatedly in the face. News (20-11-2012)- "Family man jailed for 'sinister' abduction attempt of schoolgirl, 15" A FAMILY man's attempted kidnapping of a teenage girl is the sort of sinister, frightening crime that robs children of their freedom to go outside, a judge said. The District Court this morning jailed Adrian Shane Drummond for five years and three months, with a non-parole period of two years and three months. In sentencing, Judge Rauf Soulio said the father-of-three's prior good character and lack of criminal history did not outweigh his actions. "Your offending was sinister and frightening," he said. "It is the type of offending which creates fear in the community (and) makes it difficult for children to have freedom of movement within the community." Drummond, 38, was found guilty by a jury of one count of attempted kidnapping. In November 2010 he tried to kidnap a girl, 15, at Prospect. She freed herself by punching him repeatedly in the face. Drummond was arrested two hours after the incident. Today, Judge Soulio said Drummond had never offered an explanation for his conduct, nor expressed any contrition. He said Drummond had driven around the block twice more after the attempted abduction, slowing down each time, as he passed the same girl. "In the months after the event she described having nightmares and has lost all trust and faith in strangers," he said. "She has undergone counselling, yet believes she will forever be afraid to walk any street alone." - read more- http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/man-jailed-for-sinister-abduction-attempt/story-e6frea6u-1226520266723 http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/sa-man-jailed-for-schoolgirl-kidnap-bid/story-fnat79vb-1226520491669|/images/adrian_shane_drummond_2.jpg

News (29-7-2011)- "Community disowns rapist  MEMBERS OF THE CORRELLA CREEK COMMUNITY"- WE refer to the article Convicted rapist sent back to jail (TDT 22/7/11). As residents of Corella Creek, we take offence that the convicted rapist was described as a Corella Creek man. The person in question is not, and has not been, a resident of Corella Creek. Corella Creek is a community that prides itself on its reputation as a positive environment for families and children. Residents ensure that the community maintains high standards in health, education and the general wellbeing of all its community members. The community has around 95 per cent school attendance, is crime-free and does not tolerate the use of alcohol, drugs, violence or gambling within the community. This is a standard that we community members have been building up over a long period of time. We believe that your erroneous association of the convicted rapist with Corrella Creek denigrates the reputation of our community has has the potential to undermine the work we have done over the years to develop a caring environment which promotes social responsibility in all its residents. Accordingly, we request that you correct the article and apologise to the Corella Creek community for the hurt caused by your article. EDITORS NOTE: According to Supreme Court documents, Keith Duncan has lived with his uncle at Corella Creek for the past five years and from time to time travels to Tennant Creek which is where the offence occurred. Sentencing Remarks for Mr Duncan also state he is a Wambaia man who was born on Brunette Downs, worked at Brunette Downs, Anthony Lagoon and Walmulla stations and moved to Borroloola where he lived for several years until he moved to Corella Creek following the death of his wife. http://tennantcreek.yourguide.com.au/news/opinion/letters/general/community-disowns-rapist/2242074.aspx News (22-7-2011)- "Convicted rapist sent back to jail"- A CONVICTED rapist who lured a girl into a bathroom and masturbated in front of her has been sent to prison. In October last year Keith Duncan followed two 12-year-old girls from a unit where he had been drinking to another house in Tennant Creek. There were no adults at the house when Duncan went into the bathroom and undressed. He called one of the girls into the bathroom and masturbated in her full view. After the girl fled, the man went to sleep on the bathroom floor where he was later found by one of the tenants upon his return home. The 55-year-old Corella Creek man who is a regular visitor to Tennant Creek told police he was too drunk to recall the incident. Sentencing the man in the Alice Springs Supreme Court last Friday, Justice Judith Kelly said she rated Duncans rehabilitation prospects as poor, given the nature of his previous convictions and disobedience of court orders. Especially given the fact that I am told by your counsel that you have a tendency to drink to excess when you go into town, she said. And all of your serious offending, that is the assaults, the rape and the present offence were committed while you were under the influence of alcohol. Justice Kelly acknowledged Duncan had not been before the courts since 2004 and said that increased his prospects for rehabilitation. You say - and these are your words - that you were Silly in the head on grog, Justice Kelly told Duncan. You know that the community you live in does not approve of what you did and you are sorry and ashamed. You really need to think that if you do something like this that makes you ashamed and that harms somebody when you are silly in the head from grog that maybe you should stay away from grog. Justice Kelly said she was unable to suspend part of Duncans sentence because he could not attend a residential alcohol rehabilitation program because BRADAAG and CAAAPU didnt accept people who have been convicted of a sexual offence. Duncan did not want to wait for another rehabilitation service, DASA, to complete an assessment. He was sentenced for one year and eight months with a non-parole period of 14 months, backdated to October 2010 to take into account time Duncan has already spent in custody. http://tennantcreek.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/convicted-rapist-sent-back-to-jail/2234863.aspx

Teacher turned wine merchant, Brett Armand Dutton, was a teacher and boarding house master at the Scots PGC College in 1978 when he sexually assaulted a 15 year old student. The 60 year old was sentenced for the offences in 2009. But unbeknown to the Director of Public Prosecutions at the time, police were investigating further complaints from a student he was involved with in the early 70s. Dutton fronted Brisbane District Court on Thursday where he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting and indecently treating a grade nine student at Anglican Church Grammar School in Brisbane. The court heard Dutton had taken extended leave from the Queensland Police Service in the 1970s to study at university. Crown prosecutor Ben Power said Dutton took on a role as assistant boarding master at the prestigious boys' college. It emerged 30 years later, when the victim came forward to police, Dutton had masturbated and performed oral sex on a student on school grounds sometime between the end of 1972 and 1974. The court heard Dutton finished his university studies and resigned from the police service. The Sydney resident then worked as a teacher at Scots PGC College in Warwick. Mr Power said Dutton sexually assaulted a 15 year old student in his dorm room. He also kissed the student and touched his genitals on the outside of his clothing while he slept on an excursion to Brisbane. Defence barrister Stephen Zillman said the police knew about the outstanding charges when Dutton was sentenced in 2009 but did not take action. He argued it could have all been dealt with if police had done something about it. "It's by reason of this reaction my client is faced with this terrible position of having to reappear today when unnecessary," Mr Zillman said. The Crown confirmed it was not aware of the pending investigation in 2009. The student victim of Dutton's offending in Brisbane wrote in a victim impact statement he felt no one would believe him and he would be branded a "poofter", Mr Power said. "He could never have told his father," Mr Power said. "His father died in 1997 not ever knowing what happened to his son." Mr Zilmman said his client was young at the time of offending - in his early 20s - and had not offended since. Judge Julie Ryrie said even though the offending was at the lower end of the scale it was still serious. "You did not just leave him alone after counts (offences) one and two, you persisted for a third occasion," she said. Judge Ryrie sentenced Dutton to an 18-month jail term for the sexual assault offences and 12 month jail term for the indecent act charge. Both sentences were suspended. .

"Parents admit causing death of daughter, 14, by criminal neglect" (6-5-2013) The parents of a young girl whose body was found in her Hackham West home in 2009 have admitted causing her death by criminal neglect. Richard Edward, 49, and Debra Edward, 52, faced the Supreme Court today charged with manslaughter. It had previously been alleged they killed their daughter Dawn, 14, whose death was the subject of a long-running police investigation. Although Dawn's body was found in 2009, the Edwards' were not charged until January last year. No details have ever been given, in open court, about the circumstances surrounding Dawn's death. Today, prosecutor Carmen Matteo substituted the manslaughter charges for one count each of criminal neglect causing death. Richard and Debra Edwards pleaded guilty to those charges. Ms Matteo said the couple had failed to take reasonable steps to care for Dawn despite an "appreciable risk" to her health. "It is alleged they committed an unlawful act, (namely) omitting to seek or obtain medical attention (for Dawn)," she said. "The only sensible way to describe that unlawful act is as an act which endangered life. "The charges are laid on the basis of a series of omissions in respect of the obtaining of medical attention." She asked the court for time to speak with the couple's other children. "Some are in the care of the Minister, others are adults," she said. "I require time to see if they wish to place, before the court, victim impact statements." Lawyers for the couple said they too needed time - for the completion of psychological reports.

Man, 55, jailed for sex with chatroom girl- (2-8-2012) A MIDDLE-AGED Victorian man who had sex with a vulnerable 15-year-old girl he met on a chat site has been jailed for more than five years. Michael Elliott, formerly of Geelong, twice drove to NSW to meet the girl and on the second visit in January 2010 brought her home with him. Elliott, 55, had sex with the girl on a number of occasions while she stayed with him for several weeks in a house he shared with his parents, the Victorian County Court heard on Monday. Elliott claimed the girl was 19, the court heard. Police contacted Elliott on the telephone several times and he denied the girl was with him. He told the girl he would harm himself, or her, if she left. Judge Sue Pullen said there were a number of concerning aspects to the case, including that Elliott was not deterred by police involvement. "Children are vulnerable and especially vulnerable to abuse of trust," she said. Judge Pullen said Elliott, who has admitted knowing the age of consent is 16 years, actively took the girl away from her family. She noted Elliott's offending had been described to the court as having "all the hallmarks of a Lolita obsession". Elliott gave the girl cigarettes and alcohol while she was with him, the court heard. He had met her on a telephone-based games website. Elliott was challenged by the girl's father on one of the visits he made to the girl's hometown, the court heard. On the second visit he met her late at night and drove her hundreds of kilometres back to Victoria. Judge Pullen said psychological reports indicated Elliott had a mild intellectual disability, was naive and had limited social skills. Before going into custody he had only lived away from home once, she said. Elliott, who pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and one count of an indecent act with a child under 16, was jailed for five years and two months. He must serve three years in prison before being eligible for parole and will be a registered sex offender for life. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/man-55-jailed-for-sex-with-chatroom-girl/story-e6frf7kf-1226421624624
ANDREW CLIVE ELLIS (QLD)|28 yrs old (2011)|Sentence to be updated - possible release date is now January 12-2012.|Sexual assault - sexual assault with a circumstance of aggravation - wilful exposure. . News (8-12-2011)- A Sex offender who attacked teenage girls in public will remain behind bars pending a decision on an application to stay an order releasing him back into the community. The Court of Appeal reserved judgment on an application by the Attorney General, Paul Lucas, to stay a Supreme Court judge's order releasing Andrew Clive Ellis on a supervised release order under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. The stay was sought because it was unlikely a full appeal against the release order could be heard before the Court of Appeal sits again in February. Mr Lucas wants Ellis to under go a high intensity sexual offenders rehabilitation course before being released. Ellis, 28, was 22 when he committed a series of offences in Brisbane's south in August 2005. In 2006, he was jailed for sexual assault, sexual assault with a circumstance of aggravation, and wilful exposure. The court heard at about 7am one morning a 17 year old girl was walking to the bus stop, when she noticed Ellis following her. He crossed the road, and from that side of the street, exposed himself to her and asked her to perform a sex act. The girl walked away, but Ellis ran up behind her, stood beside her, offered to walk her to school, and again asked for her to perform a sex act. As the girl walked off Ellis followed her and touched her on the buttocks. Police were called but almost immediately after committing those offences, the respondent approached a second girl aged 13 year who was on her way to school. The court heard Ellis pushed her to the ground and pulled down her tracksuit pants. He touched her in the area of her breasts, on the outside of her clothing. The girl yelled out and Ellis fled. He was caught after he admitted he was the subject of newspaper articles about the attacks. Ellis's discharge from jail date was October this year but because of sentences imposed for jail offences his release date is now January 12. But if Mr Lucas is successful on a full appeal he will remain behind bars until he completes the necessary courses. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/sex-fiend-who-attacked-girls-on-their-way-to-school-in-brisbane-will-stay-in-jail/story-e6freoof-1226217030898|/images/andrew_clive_ellis_6.jpg
CRAIG ANTHONY ELLIS (QLD- Brisbane)|32 yrs old (2011)|To be sentenced 7-11-2011.|Pleaded guilty to burglary and two counts of indecent treatment of a child under 12-years-old. Victim was a 3 yr old girl. News (5-9-2011)- A MAN who broke into a family home on Brisbane's northside and sexually assaulted a sleeping three-year-old girl is facing further charges for allegedly threatening to kill the child's mother during his sentence hearing. Craig Anthony Ellis was again removed from his sentence hearing in the District Court in Brisbane on Monday after repeatedly hurling abuse at prosecutor Vicki Loury. It was the second time Judge Michael Rackemann has had Ellis taken from the courtroom after he was thrown out of the first day of his hearing last month. As he was being led away on that occasion Ellis abused the girl's mother who was sitting in the public gallery and allegedly threatened to kill her. Judge Rackemann further adjourned the hearing today to get a pre-sentence report compiled on Ellis because of Ellis's repeated outbursts in court. The sentence will now be completed on November 7. However, Judge Rackemann said he wanted to raise a matter arising out of Ellis's behaviour on the first day of the hearing. He said the statements made by Ellis to the child's mother appeared to him to be a direct threat and he would refer a transcript of what was said to the Director of Public Prosecutions for possible criminal charges. Ellis has repeatedly tried to change the guilty plea he entered after three days of a District Court trial last September. He has also sacked several sets of lawyers and maintained it was illegal to sentence him. At the start of the trial, Ellis,32, pleaded not guilty to burglary and rape charges but changed his plea to guilty to burglary and two counts of indecent treatment of a child under 12-years-old, on January 21, 2009. Ellis has repeatedly disrupted his two sentence hearings by claiming to be innocent, abusing Ms Loury and Judge Rackemann and claiming he was in effect framed. As Ms Loury began to read the facts of the case to the court today Ellis repeatedly interjected saying: "No, I didn't." Judge Rackemann warned Ellis several times to allow Ms Loury "to do her job" before having him removed from the courtroom. Ms Loury detailed how at about 2am Ellis broke into the family's Aspley home on Brisbane's northside and went to the little girl's bedroom. He removed items of her clothing before taking photographs of her. Ms Loury said the child woke up and cried out with her parents arriving to find a naked Ellis trying to leave. The girl's father tackled Ellis and held him until police arrived. Ms Loury said during the struggle Ellis had removed the memory card from his camera and hidden it under a carpet where police later located it. She said Ellis told police he was out looking for bats when he heard a noise at the house and went to investigate. Ms Loury said the incident had turned into a nightmare for the family who had waited two years and seven months for Ellis to be sentenced. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/child-sex-offender-craig-anthony-ellis-disrupts-sentence-hearing-for-second-time/story-e6freoof-1226129623630

MALCOLM CHARLES ELLSON (SA)|59 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 16-12-2011, in the SA District Court, to 13 yrs jail - 9 yrs non parole.|News (16-12-2011)- FORMER private tutor and convicted paedophile Malcolm Charles Ellson has been jailed for at least nine years for abusing children to satisfy his sexual interest in pre-pubescent boys. Ellson, 59, appeared in the District Court today where he was sentenced for multiple child sex offences against four victims aged between nine and 11 years. Parents and supporters of the victims exclaimed "yes" and cried when Judge Simon Stretton sentenced Ellson to 13 years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of nine years. Ellson had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of persistent sexual exploitation of a child, three counts of having sexual intercourse with a person under 14 years and one of procuring an act of gross indecency. Judge Stretton chose not to declare Ellson a serious repeat offender, but instead favoured a "substantial penalty" and the chance for him to be supervised once released back in to the community. Ellson was a volunteer at a regional school, and a one-on-one tutor for students involved in a Learning Assistance Program, when he committed the offences between April 2010 and January this year. Judge Stretton said Ellson's actions were "devious" and traumatic for the victims. "It is completely reprehensible ... for you to satisfy your own emotional and sexual needs by making them engage in sexual behaviour with you while telling them it was something that was normal for children to do," he said. "I can only imagine the potential long-term harm and loss of dignity you may well have caused these children." Judge Stretton said Ellson had entered several rehabilitation programs and was motivated to make a positive change. "You are trying to address your devious sexual interest in pre-pubescent boys," he said. "You told a psychologist, if necessary, you would agree to chemical castration." Outside of court, Ellson's brother Peter said his family did not condone Malcolm's actions and felt great sympathy for the victims and their supporters. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/paedophile-tutor-malcolm-charles-ellson-jailed-for-nine-years/story-e6frea83-1226224224892|/images/malcolm_charles_ellson_2.jpg

PHILLIP ANTHONY ENDEAN (Phillip Endean) (QLD - Townsville)|45 yrs old (2011)|To be updated..Phillip Endean was extradited from Townsville in Queensland, to NSW in 2011.|Phillip Anthony Endean - Rapist- 2 rapes committed in 1987 and 1988 at NSW railway stations. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/dozens-of-rape-suspects-charged-years-after-alleged-crimes-using-crime-scene-dna/story-e6freuy9-1226200603801 http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-01-06/man-charged-over-cold-case-sex-assaults/1896348 http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/impact-statement-from-endeans-victim/story-e6frfkp9-1226200609563 "Bowen man faces NSW rape charges" (5-1-2011) A man accused of raping two women at New South Wales train stations in the late 1980s will be extradited from Townsville to Bankstown today after he was tracked down in Bowen. Phillip Anthony Endean, 45, will be escorted under heavy guard this afternoon to the Townsville Airport and flown to New South Wales to face two charges of rape and an offence of robbery tomorrow. The local fisherman, who started a new life in Bowen, marrying and having children after moving interstate several years ago, has allegedly been linked to the crimes through DNA evidence. Townsville CIB Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Gary Campbell said Endean, who is known to Queensland police, has been wanted by NSW police for more than two decades. Bankstown detectives claim he is responsible for attacks on two women at Sydney train stations less than a year apart. In 1987 a woman was raped at the Yagoona station and then in 1988 an other woman was raped then robbed at the Central Railway station. "The attacks were both on strangers so women who were unknown to the defendant," Sen-Sgt Campbell said. The Townsville CIB said it took Endean into custody this week after a tip-off from the officers down south who have been investigating the cold-case. "They tracked the defendant down, told us where he was and what he looked like," Sen-Sgt Campbell said. "Bowen and Townsville police acted on the information and made the arrest on Monday." Two police officers from Bankstown flew in after being informed that the suspect had been apprehended and applied for Endean to be extradited back to New South Wales. Detective Sergeant Paul Stamoulis and plain clothes Constable Kiera Piggott presented two warrants for the defendant's arrest which were tendered to the Townsville Magistrates Court. Police prosecutor Colleen Wainwright told Magistrate Kay Ryan that Queensland police did not oppose the extradition. Defence lawyer Ron Hinds said his client would not challenge the order and did not make a bail application.

JAMIE STEVEN ENGLAND (Jamie England) (SA - Adelaide)|43 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced April 2013, in the South Australian District Court, to 12 months jail - 6 months non parole.|Jamie Steven England - England a masseur, indecently assaulted a 20 year old woman in November 2010, at The Energy and Healing Centre in Prospect. "Prospect masseur jailed for molesting young woman" (10-4-2013) A masseur at an Adelaide healing centre has been jailed for at least six months for indecently assaulting a woman undergoing a full-body massage. Jamie Steven England, 43, was found guilty in the South Australian District Court of molesting the then 20-year-old woman in November 2010 at The Energy and Healing Centre in Prospect. Judge Dean Clayton jailed him for 12 months, fixing a non-parole period of six months. In sentencing remarks published on Wednesday, the judge said England was providing a professional service to a young woman who was nervous and inexperienced. "You took advantage of her," he said, saying the conduct had been a gross breach of trust. England had breached terms of the centre's policies which said there should be no massaging of the breasts by male therapists and that personal information was not to be passed on to clients. "There was a further term, that any breach of the policies would lead to instant dismissal," he said. "The inference is, that you broke the rules for your own sexual gratification." http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/sa-masseur-jailed-for-indecent-assault/story-e6frea83-1226617311205

News - "Bus driver jailed for child sex crimes"- A 46-year-old Melbourne bus driver who admitted to sexually abusing two young girls has been sentenced to nine years and three months in jail. Bruce Ennis of Reservoir pleaded guilty to 32 charges including sexual penetration of a child, indecent assault and making child pornography. The County Court heard Ennis met his victims, aged seven and 13, by befriending passengers who caught his bus in Melbourne's northern suburbs. He took photographs and filmed the girls during his crimes. A police search of his home later uncovered a stash of more than 13,000 child pornography images and 277 videos. In sentencing him, Judge Michael Tinney said Ennis was remorseless for his abhorrent crimes and posed a "moderately high" risk of reoffending. "I have no doubt at all you knew ... that you were involved in very serious criminal activity and nonetheless your offending continued," he said. Judge Tinney said Ennis's lack of empathy for his victims was troubling and he did not have good rehabilitation prospects. Ennis will serve a minimum of six years and nine months and will be a registered sex offender for life - AAP. http://au.news.yahoo.com/latest/a/-/latest/9507135/bus-driver-jailed-for-child-sex-crimes/

TREVOR ESSEX (NSW- Mortdale)|32 yrs old (2011)|To be updated.|See below article/s. Mortdale man guilty of sexual assault of girl, 3 (31-3-2011) A judge today found a Mortdale forklift driver guilty of using a hose nozzle to sexually assault a naked three-year-old girl. Judge Robert Sorby took 90 minutes to deliver his verdict after the accused man chose to have a trial without a jury, leaving the Downing Centre District Court judge to decide his fate. The guilty man is Trevor Essex, 32, who had charge of the girl when he hosed her down in a Penshurst backyard two years ago. As he sat in the dock today Mr Essex, dressed in a white shirt with a tie, variously looked straight ahead or with his head bowed. The childs mother had given evidence during the trial, saying she did not see the hosing incident but had seen Mr Essex hosing down the girl on earlier occasions. The girl had soiled her pants and it was Mr Essexs habit to take her outside and hose her down, allegedly to prevent the faeces going into the washing machine. In handing down his verdict Judge Sorby said that Mr Essex had lied about how the girl received injuries which required surgery. Mr Essex had said that he was playing with the girl and her younger sister in the backyard as part of usual family activities. Mr Essex is not the father of the girls but they were in his charge when the offence occurred. The defence case was that the older girl fell on a lawn mower or had accidently fallen. Earlier Mr Essex pleaded guilty to aggravated neglect of both children with the court being told he had withheld food and drink from the children as punishment. He also pleaded guilty to trying to pervert the course of justice. The case will return to the court on June 10 when submissions on sentencing will be received. http://www.theleader.com.au/news/local/news/general/mortdale-man-guilty-of-sexual-assault-of-girl-3/2120323.aspx Child sex allegation (16-3-2010) A MORTDALE man, 31, will face Central Local Court on April 5 to answer four charges, including one of sexual intercourse with a child, after the case was adjourned on Thursday.

All relate to incidents that allegedly took place in February last year. He is also accused of neglecting a child in his care in November 2008 and faces three charges of contravening restrictions in an apprehended violence order in February 2009. http://www.theleader.com.au/news/local/news/general/child-sex-allegation/1777894.aspx
ALAN GEORGE ETHERIDGE (VIC- Linton)|58 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced Feb 2011, in the Ballarat Magistrates Court, to a $3000 fine.|Alan George Etheridge/ founding member of a nudist club - caught in possession of more than 500 child pornography images and videos. Pleaded guilty at the Ballarat Magistrates Court to 1 count of possessing child pornography. Linton man guilty of possessing child porn- (3-2-2011) A PROFOUNDLY deaf Linton man yesterday escaped a jail term despite admitting to possessing more than 500 child pornography images and videos. With the help of an Auslan translator, Alan George Etheridge, 57, pleaded guilty at the Ballarat Magistrates Court to one count of possessing child porn. He was fined $3000 with conviction, but was not placed on the registered sex offenders list because the prosecution did not request him to be. The court heard on March 11 last year, police conducted a search of Etheridge's home where they seized his computer and 200 A4 print outs of pornographic images. Analysis of the computer revealed a further 500 images and videos of an "anamatronic" nature, also described as cartoon-like. Police Prosecutor Sergeant Bob Anderson said when the material was discovered Etheridge said to the police: "They're only cartoons, they're alright aren't they?". The images, described by Magistrate Peter Couzens as graphic and highly disturbing, were of an incestuous nature. Defence lawyer Michael Wardell said his client was a founding member of a local nudist club, but stressed there was no suggestion his membership was designed for any kind of sexual gratification. He also said there was no link between the material and his involvement in the club and pointed out the images did not feature any real children or people. Mr Wardell said the images were put onto Etheridge's computer via a USB memory stick by an acquaintance who was attempting to speed up the processing of the computer. Though he did not introduce the material to the computer, Etheridge did admit to accessing it. In his defence, Mr Wardell said his client had experienced a difficult few years following the death of his father and the break down of his marriage shortly after. He also suffered a back injury at work and over time developed deep depression. "He had quite a unique bond with his father," he said. "You could say they were best friends ... He felt this loss enormously." It was during this time, Etheridge became aware of a collective of naturalists in the Linton area and formed a club to create friendship and social interaction. His involvement with the club ceased following his arrest and Mr Wardell said he plans to leave the close-knit community of Linton where he now feels ostracised. Mr Couzens said he was very disturbed by a document included in the material that promoted sexual activity between family members. He also said he found it difficult to believe the explanation Etheridge gave as to how the material ended up on his computer. "Although anamatronic, the images are nonetheless graphic and highly disturbing for they depict both visually and through captions sexual acts between adults and children, children and children and are of an incestuous context," Mr Couzens said. http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/linton-man-guilty-of-possessing-child-porn/2065344.aspx

The sheriff escorted both from the court room. Solicitor Joe Fahey, representing Childs, entered a plea of not guilty for his client. He said there were aspects of the police account of the victims escape that were open to question. Mr Pogson refused bail to Childs and he was remanded in custody to appear before Grafton Local Court on April 12. Everson appeared next and she was bailed to appear on the same date. Police allege that the couple met the Casino woman at a licensed premises in Casino. The three people went to a caravan park in South Grafton before the man and woman offered to drive the 23-year-old back to her home in Casino later in the evening.

The Casino woman was allegedly indecently assaulted before she was able to escape the man and woman by jumping into the nearby Clarence River. The South Grafton man and woman fled the camping ground. The 23-year-old sought help at a nearby home where police and emergency services were contacted. A crime scene was established and police conducted a number of inquiries into the incident. About 12.40pm on Sunday Grafton police arrested the South Grafton man and woman in a car in Grafton. They were taken to Grafton Police Station where they were both charged. http://www.coffscoastadvocate.com.au/story/2010/02/02/court-in-uproar-as-man-and-partner-charged-with-se/

"Flasher jailed for showing kids pornography" (30-8-2013) A man who showed two children a porn movie, exposed himself to them and asked to see their genitals was sentenced to nine months jail recently. However, the sentence was suspended after three months. Paul Farrugia, 29, pleaded not guilty when he appeared before the Alice Springs Supreme Court for the offences which occurred in Tennant Creek last August. The Alice Springs man who was visiting Tennant Creek saw two children at Bill Allen Lookout who were with a Power and Water worker who was called out to do some maintenance work on the pump. The young children were amusing themselves by riding their scooters down the road to the bottom of the hill. Farrugia parked his car about halfway up the hill, got out and showed the children a pornographic movie on his mobile phone. He then exposed his genitals to them and invited them to show him their genitals, which they refused to do. Farrugia allegedly kissed one of the children on the cheek, saying You are a beautiful girl before fleeing however he was found not guilty of this count in court. The children immediately told the maintenance worker who reported the matter to police who arrested Farrugia later that day. He denied the allegations, spinning a yarn about needing to urinate and asking for directions in explanation for his actions. Sentencing Farrugia, Justice Dean Mildren said he accepted the offence was spontaneous in the sense he did not go to the lookout to offend. Nevertheless you did have time to think about what you were going to do, he said. You saw the children and you made a conscious decision to offend in this way, not realising that the maintenance worker was nearby. Justice Mildren said while the offending was brief and towards the lower end of seriousness, there had to be a sentence of imprisonment to show Farrugia and the community in general that the type of offence against children would not be tolerated. Farrugia, who has been in custody since 5 August will be released by early November. No conditions were fixed. http://www.tennantcreektimes.com.au/story/1741931/flasher-jailed-for-showing-kids-pornography/?cs=1513

Comparisons have often been drawn between the now 59-year-old and Leonardo DiCaprios character on the hit movie Catch Me If You Can, based on the true-life story of American fraudster Frank Abagnale Jr. Abagnale was eventually recruited by the FBI in the fight against fraud, particularly forgery, but Faulkner has reached no such heights. His life is not nearly so glamorous  he was arrested in 2006 living in a Housing Commission flat in Mascot  and has a seedy underside, with Faulkner having been listed as a registered child sex offender who seeks not just financial but sexual gain. He came to public attention in the late 1960s in Queensland, where, aged 19, he faked being a doctor at Royal Brisbane Hospital, examining two pregnant women before being busted. Through his lengthy criminal career, which has seen him in and out of custody in NSW and Queensland, he adopted a range of characters enabling him to engender trust from others through his lies. These characters have included an American CIA agent, Mike Nesmith from The Monkees, a magazine photographer, and senior officers in the US Air Force and Marine Corps. However his favourite ruse appears to be a pilot and he faked being one for Virgin Blue, Lauda Air, and Canadian Airlines, among others. In this guise, he wears a full pilots uniform and wings, obtained from disposal stores. Posing as a pilot, he had billed hotels stays to Virgin Blue. His stories to individual victims are generally based on the fact he can use his pretend occupation to gain people goods for a cheap price  whether they be airline tickets, a car, motorcycle or other valuable goods. He usually first approaches people in public at random and engages them in conversation, which turns to what he can do for them. The sums conned from his victims are usually relatively small  as little as $50  but his frauds are numerous. In 2006, when a Sydney court sentenced him to 16 months jail on charges of fraud and failing to report as a child sex offender, the court was told his criminal history in NSW took 30 pages. The court was told Faulkner was institutionalised and that his periods of offences were preceded by periods of depression. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/a-man-of-many-stories-all-lies/story-e6freuy9-1111117011044|/images/barry_faulkner_2.jpg

Feeney pleaded guilty to possessing and distributing child exploitation material between February 2011 and February 2012. News (22-3-2013) - "Mackay man jailed for having 36,000 child porn images" - A Mackay man has been jailed after being caught with more than 36,000 child pornography images and videos. Phillip Roland Feeney, 50, told officers he had the images "because he just liked them". Police found that 120 images and videos were considered a category five, meaning they showed children being used in graphic and degrading sexual acts. Feeney, who worked as a traffic controller, explored his interest in child pornography over six years through peer-to-peer file sharing over the internet. At times others were able to access the child exploitation material contained on his computer, but it is not known exactly what images were accessed, crown prosecutor Chris Winlaw told the District Court in Mackay. Judge John Baulch said child exploitation material was "vile and disgusting" and "the exploitation and corruption of children who are incapable of protecting themselves". "These children are real people, not pictures," Judge John Baulch said. Feeney pleaded guilty to possessing and distributing child exploitation material between February 2011 and February 2012. Defence barrister Bronwyn Hartigan, instructed by Morton Lawyers, said Feeney's candidness with police was significantly in his favour. "(Feeney) comes before the court knowing he has a problem and wanting to address it," Ms Hartigan said. Judge Baulch said the "sheer volume" calls for imprisonment and that Feeney must serve actual time. He was jailed for 30 months to be released after eight months and placed on three years probation. The balance will be suspended for four years. Feeney must attend any offender specific counselling and complete a sexual offender's rehabilitation course. http://www.coffscoastadvocate.com.au/news/man-pleads-guilty-possessing-child-porn/1802359/

Arrested in March 2011, when he was teaching at Santa Maria College, a Catholic girls school in Northcote. "Secret life: high school teacher's huge child-porn cache" (20-12-2012) A highly regarded school teacher of 30 years has been jailed for possessing child pornography to which he had become addicted. A Melbourne magistrate today said that Adrian Michael Fennessy, 53, had never had an adult relationship and had a separate life from his role as a teacher. The magistrate Peter Reardon described as staggering the amount of pornography that Fennessy possessed, but noted that 2 per cent was in the worst category. Melbourne Magistrates Court heard that Fennessy had downloaded more than 16,000 images, traded pornography on the internet and used different email accounts to access chat rooms. Prosecutor Luisa Dipietrantonio said that through the chat rooms Fennessy had developed the alias Mary  a 16-year-old  through which he lived out fantasies of being her. Ms Dipietrantonio said that after Fennessy was arrested in March 2011, when he was teaching at Santa Maria College, a Catholic girls school in Northcote, he admitted his reason for possessing pornography was to get off basically. Defence barrister Phil Skehan today said that such offenders were often lonely, shy and insular people who were otherwise of good character. In his sentencing remarks, Mr Reardon noted that a number of character references spoke highly of Fennessy as a teacher and a person. Mr Reardon said that on his arrest, Fennessy had rung the principal because he was concerned for the school itself. He had also undertaken therapy organised by the archdiocese of Melbourne. You were a good teacher, Mr Reardon told him, but you led a separate life. He had reduced the sentence he would have otherwise imposed because of his previous good character, lack of prior convictions, co-operation with police and that he was remorseful. Fennessy was jailed for 12 months with a minimum term of four months with the balance suspended for two years. http://www.brimbankweekly.com.au/story/1197967/secret-life-high-school-teachers-huge-child-porn-cache/?cs=12

The majority of the children pictured were five to seven year olds but included toddlers. - Finch was a school crossing guard until October 2004 and did not need a blue card for his role. Also worked in his childrens classroom as a teachers aide..-read more below- No blue card needed for role (9-3-2005) A school crossing guard who continued working for three months after police busted him with almost 9000 child pornography images on his computer last year did not need a blue card for his role. And with no criminal record until police charged Peter Grant Finch three months after a raid on his Beachmere home in July, his employer Queensland Transport had no knowledge. A Queensland Transport spokesman said yesterday the department suspended the 42-year-old on the day police charged him, October 11 last year. Mr Finch, who was ordered to serve a 12-month intensive correction order in the community by a district court judge on Monday, had downloaded 8814 child abuse images of three to 15-year-olds from the internet. A Queensland Police spokesperson said investigations often took a long time after material was seized. All evidence needs to be examined by a forensic examiner before a person can be charged. Since January 17 this year, all lollipop men and women must hold a blue card with existing employees retrospectively screened. Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian, Elizabeth Fraser, said the changes applied to paid or volunteer roles. Mr Finch would have been eligible for a blue card until October.But Ms Fraser said police regularly informed the Commission of any changes in a blue card holder's criminal history and holders could be jailed for not notifying of any change. She said a blue card would be suspended immediately for possession of child porn. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/scd-no-blue-card-needed-for-role/324210/ Crossing guards catalogue of shame (8-3-2005) A school crossing supervisor with almost 9000 child abuse images on his computer walked free from Maroochydore Courthouse yesterday after being ordered to serve his 12-month correctional order in the community. Maroochydore District Court Judge John Robertson told Peter Finch, 42, that he was a pathetic figure who was contributing to the child pornography industry by downloading the 8814 depraved images of kids. He said he could not believe the father-of-three, with a Year 12 education, failed to realise the significance of his actions. This appears to be one of the largest, if not the largest, (number of images) found in downloaded files, he said. Its obvious somewhere in the world exploitation of children is taking place. They (the images) involve actual children being exploited by the worst kind of criminal. But with Mr Finchs eldest son in his care, a guilty plea and no criminal history Judge Robertson sentenced the disability pensioner to a 12-month intensive correction order. Police seized compact discs, floppy discs, a hard drive and a computer tower from Mr Finchs Beachmere home during police raids on hundreds of Sunshine Coast homes on July 9 last year. Police identified 543 folders on Mr Finchs hard drive separated in two folders in My Documents titled B and G. Folder B contained 176 sub-folders full of images of boys performing oral sex on adult males and adult males having anal intercourse with male children. Folder G had 358 sub-folders full of images of girls performing oral sex on adult males and adult males having anal and vaginal sexual intercourse with female children. The girl folder also depicted female children aged between three and 15 years of age displaying their private parts. Prosecutor Sharon Webb said Mr Finchs computer also contained images of children in school uniform using a school crossing and children in a neighbourhood setting in a swimming pool from a camera peeking through the bushes. She said Mr Finch, who was a school crossing guard until October last year and worked in his childrens classroom as a teachers aide, had systematically organised the images which he downloaded between October 9, 2002 and June 1, 2004. Ms Webb said the majority of the children pictured were five to seven year olds but included toddlers. Defence barrister John Parker, instructed by Ryan and Bosscher, said Mr Finch was experiencing depression and problems with his ex-wife, initially believing she was sending the unsolicited pop-up screens to set him up. Mr Parker said Mr Finch, who had an industrial accident in the mid-90s which led to permanent knee and back damage, downloaded some images out of curiosity but became increasingly more curious over time. He said Mr Finch now realised the wrong that lay behind his actions. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/scd-crossing-guards-catalogue-of-shame/324215/

CRAIG FISHER (QLD)|31 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 22-8-2011, to 9 yrs jail - eligible for parole in February, 2015.|Pleaded guilty to raping a 42 yr old woman in 2009. News (23-8-2011)- "Violent rapist jailed" A man who uses violence to achieve his desires was jailed yesterday for nine years for rape and robbery. Craig Fisher, 30, pleaded guilty to violently raping a 42-year-old woman he met at the Glasshouse Mountains railway station in February, 2009. The woman, who was repeatedly punched and dragged by her hair to nearby shops, was raped orally and vaginally. Fisher also bashed a 66-year-old man, who was watching Hogans Heroes at a Murgon hotel, to steal his wallet in December, 2009. Crown prosecutor David Nardone said Fisher had been released from jail on parole just 10 days before the rape. He said Fisher committed the robbery shortly after his release later the same year. It appears that nothing deters him, Mr Nardone said. Violence appears to be a way of life for Mr Fisher and the community deserves protection from him. Barrister Steve Courtney said his client had been drinking heavily and had run out of cigarettes. He said his client went looking for dumpers  smoked cigarettes butts that can be recycled  when he came across his rape victim. Mr Courtney said the incident unfolded after the victim refused to give him a Tally-Ho paper. He said his client targeted the robbery victim after the man, who knew Fishers family and tried to be friendly, called him a coon. The court heard Fisher pleaded guilty at the eleventh hour after he accepted a conglomerate of images from the railway station Judge John Robertson said those images seriously undermine your protestations of innocence. Judge Robertson described prolonged violence where Fisher humiliated and frightened his victim into succumbing to his desires. Judge Robertson said Fishers behaviour was that of a man who did not hesitate to use violence against others to get what he wanted. He said the assault had a profound effect on the woman, who suffered significant facial injuries. She was virtually a stranger to you, as was the victim of the robbery, Judge Robertson said. Fisher has already served 182 declarable days in custody. He can apply for parole from February, 2015. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2011/08/23/violent-rapist-jailed-attacks-strangers-coast/

Fisk has been convicted in NSW and Victoria for offences against at least seven victims from 1970 to 1989. Fisk was a former associate of convicted pedophile Robert "Dolly" Dunn and Philip Bell and was a subject of significant publicity when he gave evidence before the NSW royal commission into police corruption in the 1990s. "NSW sex offender to stay under state watch" (28-3-2013) A notorious NSW sex offender will remain under the state's watch for another three years after a judge found he continues to pose an unacceptable risk. The state of NSW sought a court order to keep Colin John Fisk under extended supervision that would force him to comply to a raft of restrictions over his employment, his accommodation, his personal appearance, his movements and who he associates with. The 64-year-old has been subject to such an order since being released from prison in May 2009 after serving 12 years for a large number of sexual offences against boys from 1971 to 1988. At the NSW Supreme Court on Thursday, Justice Robert Beech-Jones placed a further order on Fisk, saying that his attitudes coupled with his history of offending meant there continued to be a moderate to high risk that he would reoffend. Justice Beech-Jones pointed to a "concerning" instance in May last year when Fisk had contact with a 16-year-old boy at a train station and offered him cigarettes. According to the boy, Fisk suggested he post a video of himself on YouTube and commented on other lewd videos available on the web. Talking to a forensic psychiatrist about the encounter, Fisk confided that he felt "in tune" with the boy and wanted to help with his "cultural development". Justice Beech-Jones said the incident highlighted how Fisk continued to harbour "romantic self-delusions" and that he readily engaged in sexualised banter with people he meets. The court heard that while Fisk now understood that society did not condone his attraction to underage males he had a "long standing tendency to see himself as a martyr and victim of the system". He had also expressed the view that his previous victims "benefited from his life guidance". Fisk was a former associate of convicted pedophile Robert "Dolly" Dunn and was a subject of significant publicity when he gave evidence before the NSW royal commission into police corruption in the 1990s. Justice Beech-Jones said that while Fisk had not reoffended since leaving prison, he might come to believe he could do so without detection if he was not supervised. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/nsw-sex-offender-to-stay-under-state-watch/story-e6freono-1226608600407 http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-08-11/judge-fears-paedophile-fisk-will-reoffend/1386910 http://www.theherald.com.au/story/445107/newcastle-supreme-court-orders-further-supervision-for-colin-john-fisk/ http://www.smh.com.au/national/fiskx2019s-plea-for-freedom-20090731-e4f3.html|/images/colin_fisk_2.jpg

ALLYN WILSON FITZGERALD (WA- Perth)|40 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Allyn Fitzgerald, pleaded guilty in the Perth Magistrates Court 10-1-2012 to 41 counts of using a surveillance device to record without knowledge. Admitted to secretly filming more than 40 women showering in Perth hostels over a 12 month period. News (10-1-2012)- A man has been refused bail after admitting to secretly filming more than 40 women showering in Perth hostels, after being caught in the act yesterday. Allyn Wilson Fitzgerald, 40, pleaded guilty in Perth Magistrates Court today to 41 counts of using a surveillance device to record without knowledge. The court was told Fitzgerald recorded film clips on his iPhone of the women while hiding in nearby cubicles. The offences happened over a 12-month period at various backpackers around Perth. In court this afternoon, his duty lawyer made an application for bail on his behalf, but conceded Fitzgerald's behaviour was "abhorrent". The lawyer told the court the underlying cause for the behaviour was the post-traumatic stress disorder and depression Fitzgerald suffered after serving as a submariner in the Australian Navy for 12 years. He was arrested in November last year after one of the women caught him in the act, but was released on bail. Fitzgerald failed to appear in court last Friday for his set appearance. Detectives arrested him overnight after he was caught filming more women at another Perth hostel yesterday. A police prosecutor opposed bail, saying the community had to come first. "The number one point is the protection of the community," he said. "It is very horrific for these 41 females." Magistrate Joe Randazzo said the prospect of Fitzgerald returning to backpackers accomodation was alarming and he was concerned he may fail to appear at his next court date if granted bail. He refused bail, saying there was a likelihood that Fitzgerald would committ further offences unless he was kept in custody. "[It is] wrongdoing of such a serious nature as to make a grant of bail inappropriate," Magistrate Randazzo said. Fitzgerald has been remanded in custody and will reappear in court in March for his sentencing. A pre-sentence report and psychiatric report was ordered for the sentencing. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/shower-pervert-refused-bail/story-e6frg143-1226241129963

News (7-4-2011)- "Businessmans porn files" A MARGATE business owner kept a backup copy of old work files despite knowing it contained child pornography, the Supreme Court has heard. Grant Andrew Damien Flavel, 36, formerly of Snug, today pleaded guilty to a count of possessing child exploitation material. Crown Prosecutor Jane Ansell told the court police went to Flavells home on June 16 last year and found a hard disk drive in a gun safe. While officers continued their search Flavel attempted to hide the drive, which was found on a nearby roof an hour later. The disk was found to contain 350 still images and 250 videos showing infants and young children engaged a range of degrading sexual acts. Defence layer Craig Rainbird told the court Flavel formerly owned marine businesses in the Kingston and Margate areas and the disk had been used to back up files from a number of computers on his company network. In 2003, Flavel discovered a virus-ridden computer at one of his businesses contained child pornography and disposed of it, but the files had already inadvertently been included in the backups, Mr Rainbird said. While his client was aware the files existed, he did not download them and had not accessed them, although admitted failing to delete them, he said. Flavels business ventures  and his marriage  had subsequently collapsed and he had been declared bankrupt and now lived and worked interstate, the court heard. Justice David Porter, who said he regarded the offence as serious, will sentence Flavel tomorrow. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/04/07/220591_scalesofjustice.html
STEPHEN JOHN FLEMING  (SA - Salisbury North)|47 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 31-3-2011 in Adelaide District Court to 14 yrs jail - 8.5 yrs non parole. Sentence reduced on appeal in July 2011 to 10yrs jail/ 7yrs non parole. |"Repeat child sex offender term cut" (29-7-2011) A "perverted" repeat paedophile has had his sentence slashed. Yesterday the Court of Criminal Appeal found Stephen John Fleming's sentence for child sex offences was excessive. It ordered his 14-year sentence be reduced to 10 years, with a new non-parole period of seven years - 18 months less than originally imposed. Fleming had previously been sentenced to 30 months for child offences between 1998 and 1999. Earlier this year a District Court jury found Fleming guilty of persistent sexual exploitation of a child between 2004 and 2007. That child was aged between six and nine at the time. Justices Margaret Nyland and Michael David said the 14-year term was excessive. "It is outside the range of appropriate sentencing for offending of this type, serious as it is," Justice David said.  http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/repeat-child-sex-offender-term-cut/story-e6frea6u-1226103818309  "'Pervert' molested girl after release" (1-4-2011) After being released from jail for child sex offences, a man molested another young child for two years. Now Stephen John Fleming, 47, of Salisbury North, has returned to jail to begin the 14-year term imposed yesterday in the District Court. A jury found him guilty of persistent sexual exploitation of a child between 2004 and 2007. In sentencing yesterday, Judge Geoffrey Muecke said Fleming's victim, aged between 6 and 9 at the time, believed the justice system had failed her by his release. Fleming was previously sentenced to 30 months for child sex offences he committed between 1998 and 1999. "She believes you should have never been let out of prison in the first place," Judge Muecke said. "She believes ... you are a cold, sick, perverted man."

News (10-10-2007)- "Corby witness loses sentence appeal" A Victorian prisoner who gave evidence at convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby's trial in Bali has lost an appeal against his own sentence. John Patrick Ford was sentenced in May 2006 to eight years' jail after a Victorian County Court jury found him guilty of 11 charges, including rape and stalking. The 43-year-old, an inmate of Ararat Prison, west of Melbourne, appealed the sentence in the Victorian Court of Appeal. At Ford's trial, the court heard that he subjected a former girlfriend to repeated assaults and threats between March 2003 and February 2004. He raped and stalked her and threatened to kill her after she tried to sever contact with him. In the appeal, Ford's lawyers argued that trial judge Margaret Rizkalla had erred in directing the jury on a count of aggravated burglary, relating to an incident on Valentine's Day 2004 in which Ford had broken into his victim's house and waited for her armed with a knife. They also argued that the jury was inconsistent in verdicts they handed down on the various charges and had not taken into account emails between Ford and his former girlfriend. Justices Frank Vincent, David Ashley and Robert Redlich dismissed the appeal. "The respective positions were clearly put before the jury and in the context of appropriate instructions concerning the burden and standard of proof," Justice Vincent said. "Her Honour's reference to the applicant's (Ford's) admission that he brought the knife into the house, albeit, he claimed, from the shed, was made against that background," he said. "None of the grounds of the application having been made out, I would dismiss this application." Ford told an Indonesian court in 2005 that Corby was an unwitting "victim of domestic drug trafficking run by petty criminals and cowards". http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=262230 News (26-5-2006)- "Corby witness jailed over rape" The Victorian prisoner who testified at the original Bali trial of Schapelle Corby has been jailed for at least five years for rape and stalking. A County Court jury last December found John Patrick Ford guilty of a string of charges including raping a woman he knew. The court heard the offences occurred between March 2003 and February 2004 and involved one victim. The jury heard that on one occasion Ford, now 42, placed a knife to the victim's throat and threatened to "bleed (her) like a pig". He also broke into the victim's house armed with a knife and put a blood-soaked teddy bear on her bed. In January 2004, Ford rang the victim and threatened to kill himself if she did not come to his home. When the woman arrived he raped her, the jury was told. Ford was found guilty of 11 charges, including one count of rape, three counts of intentionally causing injury and two counts of threatening to inflict serious injury. Ford, who has already spent more than 800 days in remand, was found guilty of one count of false imprisonment and one of threat to kill and of stalking. He was also found guilty of one count each of aggravated burglary and burglary. Judge Rizkalla said she satisfied Ford was capable of rehabilitation as long he didn't make contact with the victim again. He stood emotionless as Judge Rizkalla sentenced him to eight years' jail with a minimum jail term of five years' jail. Trial delayed- The court heard Ford's trial was delayed due to the media coverage Corby's case had attracted. Judge Rizkalla said as a result of giving evidence in Corby's trial Ford would also suffer an onerous prison term. Ford told a Bali court that the marijuana found in Corby's bodyboard bag was placed there without her knowledge by criminals involved in a drug-trafficking ring operating at Australian airports. At an earlier hearing Ford's lawyer, Tom Danos, said he believed two violent attacks on Ford were a result of testifying in Bali. Mr Danos read a letter from Corby to Ford dated March 29, 2003: "Dear Mr John Ford," it said. "Firstly thank you. No words can express my gratitude, relief and thankfulness of the way I feel towards you. You have and are putting your own safety and welfare in danger. Coming forward to tell what you know, to do all you possibly can do to help me out of this living hell I have unwillingly found myself in." "Pray today the judges will hear everything you have to say and pray today, the outcome of this trial - your testimony - will set me free, to come home, where I belong. Today you may save my life. My deepest respect, thank you, Schapelle". http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/corby-witness-jailed-over-rape/2006/05/26/1148524868143.html|/images/john_ford_2.jpg

"Justice for Bailey" (8-5-2013) His grandmothers describe Bailey Constable as a happy little boy who reached out to them for help when his mother started dating Nathan William Forrest - his tormenter and eventual killer. But Karen Chapman and Sandra Campbell say the system let Bailey down, with DOCS ignoring their repeated calls for help and medical evidence of the boy's abuse. After Bailey's death, he was dealt a final blow when a judge handed Forrest a penalty of only eight years with a non-parole period of six years. Now, his grandmothers are fighting for justice. Bailey's family has also set up an online petition and Facebook page to demand an appeal.-A Current Affair http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8655199 https://www.facebook.com/HelpUsGiveBaileyAVoice http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/the-appeal-of-nathan-william-forrests-6-year-gaol-sentence.html "NSW child killer jailed for six years" (19-4-2013) The family of a little boy bashed to death by his mother's partner has reacted in disbelief as his killer was jailed for at least six years. Shouts of "no" and "six years!" rang out in the Supreme Court in Sydney as Nathan Forrest was sentenced for bashing to death four-year-old Bailey Constable while bathing him in his rural NSW home on April 1, 2011. Bailey's maternal grandmother, Karen Chapman, collapsed in her husband's arms after the maximum eight-year sentence was handed down. Weeks before his death on April 1, 2011, Bailey told Ms Chapman that Forrest was hurting him. She alerted the Department of Community Services (DoCs) after Bailey told her, "He hurts me, nanny" and "(He) holds me down in the bath" but no official action was taken. Bailey's mother, Jessica Constable, wept throughout the sentencing hearing. Bailey's paternal grandparents said DoCs had failed Bailey miserably by forcing the Chapmans to return him to his mother's home. "They returned him to his death on the authorities's say-so," Sandra Campbell told reporters outside court. "He should have been removed. He was not safe." Ms Chapman was taken to hospital by ambulance after the sentence was handed down. The family has been torn apart by Bailey's death, with Ms Chapman previously telling the court she would never forgive her daughter - her only child. "She did not protect her child," Ms Campbell said of Ms Constable. "She took him back into a house where she knew he was getting beaten up by that bastard." Ms Constable told reporters she was unhappy with the sentence. "It was not adequate at all for a four-year-old child's life being taken," she said. Justice Elizabeth Fullerton found Bailey died from multiple injuries inflicted by Forrest, who was coming down from the drug ice at the time. Bailey had wet the bed and Forrest insisted on being "the father figure" and bathing him. Ms Constable told the court she heard four loud bangs from the bathroom and Forrest saying, "Stop it Bailey, stop it". She said she was afraid of Forrest, who had been violent in the past. Both Forrest and Ms Constable initially lied about Bailey's injuries to hospital staff and police, and the court heard Bailey had suffered head injuries in the week before his death. "On the night Bailey was fatally assaulted, he was particularly vulnerable and defenceless given his ill health and the fact he was recovering from head injuries," Justice Fullerton said. Taking into account time already served, Forrest will be eligible for parole in May 2017. http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/nsw-child-killer-jailed-for-six-years-20130419-2i4it.html http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/how-innocent-bailey-contable-was-betrayed-by-docs/story-e6frg6n6-1226630303589 http://www.lukesarmy.com/tags/nathan-william-forrest http://www.dailyliberal.com.au/story/871036/no-bail-for-accused-child-murderer-case-adjourned/|/images/nathan-william-forrest-2.jpg

STEPHEN JOHN FOSTER (SA- Ethelton)|63 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 1-11-2011, in the Adelaide District Court, to 3 yrs jail - 18 months non parole.|Stephen Foster - pleaded guilty to aggravated dissemination and possession of child pornography. News (1-11-2011)- An Adelaide man caught hoarding child pornography by US authorities has been jailed for three years. The District Court this morning ordered Stephen John Foster serve at least 18 months of that sentence before being eligible for parole. Foster, 63, of Ethelton, pleaded guilty to aggravated dissemination and possession of child pornography. His perverted collection of 19,100 images and 1060 videos was uncovered by the New Mexico branch of the Federal Bureau of Investigations during an online sting operation. Foster unwittingly shared some of his haul with an FBI special agent in October 2010, leading to his arrest by SA Police in January this year. In sentencing today, Judge Dean Clayton said most of Foster's images and videos fell into the first two categories of child pornography, deemed to be the "less serious". Others, however, were of the highest category which includes acts of bondage and bestiality. "This is not a victimless crime," Judge Clayton said. "The production, possession and dissemination of child pornography leads to the abuse of many children around the world." He said Foster's illicit hobby developed while he served as the primary carer for his aged parents. "Your siblings hold you in high regard, saying you sacrificed a lot in selflessly taking on that role," he said. "But performing that role isolated you from normal social contact and you became reclusive, developing an interest in pornography five to six years ago." Prior to sentencing, Foster's lawyer read a letter of apology to the court. "(This is) a time in my life I'm ashamed of, and I'm sorry I didn't have the sense to do (things) differently," it said. "I would like to put this sorry time behind me... and would like a chance to finally get my life back on track." Judge Clayton, however, said neither that contrition nor Foster's previous good character warranted suspension of his sentence. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/recluse-63-jailed-over-thousands-of-child-porn-images-after-fbi-sting/story-e6frea83-1226182362680|/images/stephen_foster_2.jpg

See co-offender - Nicholas James Murdoch. "Babysitters from hell guilty of child pornography charges in Brisbane District Court" (8-5-2014) Babysitters from hell who photographed themselves in sexual poses with a toddler have been jailed after police found the images stored on computers alongside child porn movies, photos and animation. Engaged couple Nicholas James Murdoch, 27, and Loren Marita Fothergill, 28, pleaded guilty in Brisbane District Court today to 10 counts of indecent treatment of a child, making child exploitation material and for possessing child exploitation material. Crown prosecutor Phil McCarthy said Australian Federal Police investigating the pair over a large quantity of child pornography material found photos that revealed the indecent treatment of a little girl, aged between two and three, and the creation of exploitative images between April 2011 and March 2013. Mr McCarthy said the images showed Fothergill holding the childs genitalia open with her fingers and showed Murdochs erect penis being held by the child. The girl was positioned in the photos so that her genitalia was exposed for the camera. He said the couple tried to downplay the images when police contacted them, saying they were within the realm of ``a childs curiosity. Judge Brian Harrison said the couples offending amounted to ``blatant abuse. .

Victims were 3 boys aged 9-15 yrs old. News (15-3-2011)- Reading out his comments, crown prosecutor Kara Shead said: "Our community has the right to know about the accused so parents can protect their children". Ms Shead also said the public interest in securing the prosecution of offenders who commit such crimes was great, adding that one of the victims came forward only after reading Fox's name in the newspaper - . http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/sydney-developer-admits-paedophile-crimes/story-fn3dxity-1226022022225 News (24-11-2011)- A wealthy property developer who sexually abused three boys he gained access to through a child paedophile ring has been jailed for at least 4 years. Mitchell Bruce Fox, 68, of Northbridge, was part of a child sex ring operating in Sydney in the late 1970s and '80s, which had links to the notorious paedophile Robert "Dolly" Dunn. The Sydney District Court this morning heard Fox, a former partner in a Pink Panther printing business, sexually abused the boys, aged between nine and 15, over a five-year period at his homes in Bellevue Hill and Collaroy and on a boat on Sydney Harbour. Judge Michael King said Fox was introduced to the boys by other members of the ring, including John Thomas Shiel and Phillip Edwards, who had "groomed" the boys to participate in sexual activity with adult men. Judge King said Fox pleaded guilty to seven charges in March this year after his lawyer, in "a desperate last roll of the dice", failed in a bid to have each victim give evidence in a separate trial. Fox often paid Sheil $50 for access to the boys, who had been trained to do sexual acts with men. Judge King rejected a submission from the defence that the victims had consented and did not physically resist, saying the youths had a "warped" view of the world as a result of being groomed by the ring. One victim told police that, by the time he was "pimped" to Fox, "it was normal to me". "For the offender's deviant sexual gratification, these boys were a mere sexual commodity for which he was willing to pay," Judge King said. Fox, who was born in the US and has two daughters, aged 27 and 24, to his first wife, and a 15-year-old son to his second wife, has been in protective custody since April. One of his daughters sobbed loudly as Judge King sentenced Fox to a non-parole period of 4 years, with a maximum sentence of nine years. Fox will be eligible for parole on October 28, 2015. This month, Shiel was sentenced to a minimum 11 years' jail after he pleaded guilty to 54 charges committed between 1978 and 2007, including indecent assault, being an accessory to indecent assault, and 23 charges of buggery. Karen Lindley, from the organisation Bravehearts, said Fox was jailed according to sentencing principals in force at the time of the offences, rather than penalties set under legislation today. "In historical cases we like to see a longer sentence but it's still a fairly big sentence and it goes some way towards the victims feeling that there was justice here today." Ms Lindley said the sentence should encourage other victims of historical sexual abuse to come forward. "The community is saying very strongly that [when it comes to] historical cases, if you offend, you will be bought to trial. "It takes a lot of courage to come forward but, if you have been offended against, people are there to stand behind you and help you get justice." http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/developer-insydney-child-sex-ring-jailed-20111124-1nw3e.html "Property tycoon faces paedophile ring accusations" (23-6-2010) http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/property-tycoon-faces-paedophile-ring-accusations-20100622-yvs1.html

Child porn user jailed (21-3-2012) A man found with more than 33,000 child pornography photos on his computer has been sentenced to four years in prison. Ipswich District Court heard a major international police investigation led officers to the home of Paul Graeme Frazer-Poynting, 45, on July 18, 2009. Police seized his Apple iMac computer and forensic investigators found Frazer-Poynting had about 2500 child abuse images and movies. While on bail waiting to be sentenced, police received information via the cyber crimes centre that Frazer-Poynting was still downloading child porn. Federal Police raided his home again on August 23 last year and found 30,609 images on a new computer. Commonwealth prosecutor Aimee Aisthorpe said the photos showed thousands of infants and children being sexually assaulted and abused. Ms Aisthorpe said 44 images depicted sadism and bestiality, and called for a penalty to deter like-minded individuals. Judge Deborah Richards said a concerning feature of Frazer-Poynting's behaviour was while awaiting sentence for the first offences he downloaded many more, and much worse images. Judge Deborah Richards said Frazer-Poynting's actions were "vile". "It is very important a message is sent that this won't be tolerated by the court and community," Judge Richards said. A non-parole period of 18 months was set, and 199 days of pre-sentence custody was taken into account. Defence barrister Steve Kissick said Frazer-Poynting had an excellent work history as a Brisbane-based chef and caterer, and still had the support of his wife and son. Mr Kissick said some of the images were duplicates and some were thumbnail-size making them "unusable". The court heard while waiting to be sentenced originally, Frazer-Poynting misled the court by saying he was rehabilitated despite continuing to download child porn. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/child-porn-user-jailed-ipswich/1312236/
LESLIE FRED FREE (WA)|yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 5 yrs jail..To be updated.|Leslie Fred Free- Sex offender. News (22-9-2010)- "Static test hinders sex fiend arrest"- Reliance on a North American personality test is hampering applications by the Director of Public Prosecutions to keep allegedly dangerous sex offenders in jail as WAs Supreme Court judges lead a national backlash against the psychometric tool. The Static-99 test developed by US and Canadian researchers purports to predict a sex criminals chances of reoffending. The DPP frequently uses Static-99 to determine if former offenders whose jail terms have expired remain a high risk to society, and should therefore stay in jail. However, in a string of Supreme Court judgements since 2007 judges have expressed grave doubts about the test. Last Friday, Justice John McKechnie suggested the main reason the DPP applied to keep sex offender Leslie Fred Free behind bars after his five-year jail term expired was his high-risk score in the test. http://www.oneperth.com.au/2010/09/22/sex-fiend-test-neuters-dpp/

News (26-3-2012)- "Worst criminals able to reoffend" Some of Tasmania's worst criminals are reoffending after the court refuses to declare them dangerous criminals a classification that gives judges the power to jail them indefinitely. There are seven declared dangerous criminals in Tasmania, being mostly child abusers and serial rapists. Crown prosecutors recently applied to add violent Hobart home invader Gavin Raymond McIntosh to the list. Beyond Abuse spokesman Steve Fisher said it appeared either the Director of Public Prosecutions was not making enough dangerous prisoner applications to the court or the court was rejecting too many. The Supreme Court in 2003 refused a prosecution application to declare child sex abuser Anthony John Minney, of Launceston, a dangerous criminal, yet he was jailed last September for 14 months after pleading guilty to loitering near children. Minney has a long history of sexually assaulting children and last year asked police to send him to prison. In 2003 Justice Ewan Crawford said Minney's child sex abuse case was ``not sufficiently exceptional'' to justify making a dangerous criminal order. "Seven people (declared dangerous) across the whole of Tasmania does not seem to indicate they are using the tool at their disposal enough, '' Mr Fisher said. "The dangerous criminal register was brought in to serve a purpose and that's to do exactly that to keep them off the street.'' Late last year convicted serial rapist Kevin Richard Bell failed in his bid to have his dangerous criminal order overturned. Bell was sentenced to 12 years' jail in 1991 for six rapes, one indecent assault and four counts of defilement of a young girl. Six months after being paroled in 1998, he committed sex offences against children aged three and 16. Rocherlea man Brendan James Freeman was declared a dangerous criminal in 2004 and sentenced to seven years' jail after admitting to raping and bashing a woman in Launceston. Jamie Gregory McCrossen was placed on the dangerous criminal registry in 1991 after he pleaded guilty to attempting to commit the crime of threatening to murder. Colin John Sparkes (1997) was also placed on the list after being convicted of burglary with intent to rape. Other criminals the DPP has applied to have placed on the dangerous criminal register include Ian John Brumby (2002) who had committed assault, robbery and rape, and serial rapist Paul Vincent Phillips (1998). http://www.theadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/worst-criminals-able-to-reoffend/2500119.aspx

Roy Friend, 58, was arrested late last year for allegedly engaging with the 15-year-old boy at Ipswich. He's accused of speaking intimately with the boy and giving him his phone number.

The court was told Fullbrook crept into the girl's bedroom about 2am (AEST) on January 1 and assaulted her by rubbing between her buttocks and under her singlet. Prosecutor Chris Minnery said Fullbrook then asked the girl if she could keep a secret before leaving the room. Mr Minnery told the court the girl's mother went into the room soon after to find the child shaking and crying. Fullbrook, an aviation student at Griffith University on the Gold Coast, was ordered out of the house and later sent a message of apology to the girl's father. He told police he had not had much luck with women, and that his loneliness at the time caused him to lose control.

The spokesman said Corrective Services alleged Fuller was in breach of his conditions by being in the park and having contact with a child under 16. He said Fuller had been subject to close supervision since his release. That included more than 100 office visits, 82 home visits, fortnightly contact with a psychologist and the recent completion of the Sexual Offending Maintenance Program  his last attendance being on June 29 this year.

RENEE JEAN MALYSCHKO (NSW)|28 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|News (6-12-2007)- A woman involved in home-made porn films with two 14-year-old Adelaide girls has been found guilty of criminal offences. Rebecca Jane Clarke, of Goulburn in NSW, was found by a South Australian District Court judge to have incited the teenaged girls to perform sex acts. The 23-year-old also was found guilty of producing child pornography by Judge Michael Boylan. Clarke had pleaded not guilty to charges of inciting a child to commit an indecent act and producing child pornography, telling her trial she believed the girls were 17-years-old. Clarke was one of three people charged over the filming of six home-made pornographic films between July 2005 and February last year. Her co-accused - Daniel Troy Osis, 25, and Renee Jean Malyschko, 23 - were tried separately and pleaded guilty in June this year to having unlawful sexual intercourse with the two 14-year-old girls. Osis and Malyschko also pleaded guilty to two counts each of inciting a child to commit an indecent act and producing child pornography, while Osis was convicted of two further counts of possessing child pornography. Both have yet to be sentenced. Judge Boylan found Clarke guilty on Thursday despite saying she "honestly and, indeed, reasonably believed the two girls were 17". "I'm of the view that does not matter given the gravity of the offence," Judge Boylan said. Sentencing submissions for Clarke will be held in January next year. http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=333008

The Broome District Court heard how the young woman was drinking at the towns Murphy's Bar before separating from her friends and becoming lost on the way home about 2am. She phoned her boyfriend in Italy to voice concern after taking a wrong turn into Anne Street before her fateful encounter with Agnes Violet Oliver, then 18, and her friends Earvin Jared Dimer and Darren Peter Upkett, also then 18.

RACHEL PFITZNER (NSW)|31 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 9-12-2009, in the Supreme Court to 25.5 yrs jail - 19 yrs and 2 months non parole.|Rachel Pfitzner - Child Killer - Pleaded guilty to murdering her 2 yr old son Dean Shillingsworth in October 2007.. Dean's body was later found in a suitcase floating on a duck pond at Ambarvale. "Mother gets 25 years' jail for murder" (10-12-2009) There was no shortage of people in Dean Shillingsworth's life who would have given him all the love he needed - but his mother, Rachel Pfitzner, never could. Something she saw in her two-year-old boy helped fuel a rage within. After weeks of mistreating him, she finally murdered Dean in October 2007. His body was found in a suitcase floating on a duck pond at Ambarvale. ''I tried to love him,'' Pfitzner told police. But, she added, ''I didn't see Dean as a child.'' Pfitzner, 28, pleaded guilty to his murder. She nodded as she was sentenced in the Supreme Court yesterday to at least 19 years and two months in jail. Earlier she had wiped away tears as Justice Robert Hulme recounted her different versions of the killing. Pfitzner told police she shook Dean and threw him to the ground. But in a secretly recorded conversation, she told her mother she choked him, swinging him around by his hooded jumper when ''the rage came up''. Justice Hulme said that while Dean was asphyxiated, it was impossible to establish how. Finding reasons for the murder was almost as difficult. Pfitzner's troubled relationship with Dean's father, Paul Shillingsworth, played a part. He had allegedly threatened her and she told police that when she looked at Dean, ''all I could see was Paul''. "I just kept seeing his father and couldn't stop myself,'' she said. Dean was supposed to be in the care of Mr Shillingsworth's mother, Ann Coffey. Pfitzner failed to return the boy after an access visit in July 2007 and initially was ''on a real high'' to have him back. But things soon deteriorated. Pfitzner severely punished Dean for what she saw as his deliberate disobedience. When he sought her affection, she thought he was clingy. She resented his presence and could not bear to have him touch her. It was clear in the weeks before the murder that Pfitzner was struggling to cope. Her mother had promised to take Dean in, and Mrs Coffey was taking legal action to regain custody of the boy. Still, Pfitzner would not give him up. On October 3, she told a social worker she could not stand Dean and ''just wanted him gone as soon as possible''. Eight days later - the day a court ordered he be returned to Mrs Coffey - she killed him. Justice Hulme said Pfitzner, who has a severe personality disorder, ''gave in to her anger'' but did not intend to kill Dean. ''I am satisfied that she came to loathe Dean because he reminded her of his father, towards whom she held ambivalent feelings. ''Dean was entitled to love, protection and nurture but instead she took away his very life''. He jailed Pfitzner for a maximum of 25 years. The woman Dean called ''Mum'', his grandmother Mrs Coffey, was too distraught to comment outside court. As for Pfitzner, she is convinced she has her son's absolution. ''Dean forgives me,'' she recently told a psychologist. ''He's safe now and with God.'' http://www.smh.com.au/national/mother-gets-25-years-jail-for-murder-20091209-kk39.html http://www.dailyadvertiser.com.au/story/869688/the-sydney-toddler-that-docs-failed/ http://www.lukesarmy.com/content/loving-memory-dean-shillingsworth-who-died-aged-two-due-docs-nsw-negligence

"WA 'loner' jailed for child porn offences" (14-2-2013) AN "emotionally unstable'' and "sexually confused'' man who stored and shared thousands of images and hundreds of videos of child pornography has been sentenced to more than four years in jail. Travis Terance Gale, 26, pleaded guilty to a string of offences including possessing and producing child exploitation material, and using a carriage service to make child pornography available. The Perth District Court heard on Thursday that Gale collected hardcore child pornography over several years, including more than 4500 images and more than 450 videos. He also sent 21 images to an undercover FBI agent in the United States. Judge Philip McCann rejected the suggestion Gale was not aroused by the images but accepted there was a degree of addiction and helplessness on his part. "There was quite a high number of videos compared to most cases that come before the court,'' he noted. "Videos are more serious than still photographs, although not for the victims, I stress, because they are more powerful representations of the depravity involved and they are more apt to both arouse and corrupt the viewer and create a market or motive for others to abuse children. "Videos also more powerfully and vividly publish the child's degradation and humiliation.'' The judge said that while no one had counted the number of victims, there were believed to have been hundreds. The court heard Gale also secretly filmed a juvenile acquaintance while he was naked in his bedroom, which Judge McCann described as a breach of trust. "The victim and his parents are very upset, ashamed and humiliated by what occurred,'' he said. "The victim now has significant trust and emotional problems and is extremely unsettled by this offending.'' Judge McCann said Gale was a loner with limited life skills and experience. He accepted Gale was remorseful and did not have prior convictions but said the offending was chronic and not a one-off error of judgment. He said Gale was immature, emotionally unstable and confused about sexual matters. "I find that you're a high risk of reoffending unless a number of protective factors are put in place and sex offender treatment is successfully completed,'' Judge McCann said. Combining the federal and state offences, Gale was sentenced to four years and five months imprisonment, backdated to October last year when he was taken into custody. He must serve a minimum of two years and four months before being eligible for parole. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/wa-loner-jailed-for-child-porn-offences/story-e6frg13u-1226578231302

FIONA GARTH  (TAS - Claremont)|37 yrs old (2010) |To be updated.|Pleaded guilty to assaulting a 4 yr old boy who died in her care. "Babysitter pleads guilty to assaulting 4yo" (24-6-2010) Garth has admitted striking Liam Osborne. A Tasmanian woman has pleaded guilty to assaulting a four-year-old boy who died in her care. Fiona Maree Garth assaulted Liam Osborne while she was babysitting him and his twin brother at her Claremont home last June. The 37 year old was originally charged with his murder but last month that charge was dropped. Today she has pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court in Hobart to an indictment that states she held the child under water, grabbed him by the arms and struck him on his body. But Garth's lawyer Bruce McTaggart says his client plans to dispute the facts of the indictment and is only admitting striking Liam Osborne. Garth was bailed to reappear in court next month. The Prosecution still will not say why the murder charge was dropped. .|/images/fiona-garth-2.jpg

Kyle Rohan Garth, 20, of Pinjarra, pleaded guilty to the murder of Jessie Cate In the Stirling Gardens Magistrates Court today, PerthNow reported. Garth, who had previously dated Jessie's older sister, appeared by video link from WA's Hakea prison, where he admitted killing the teenager after picking her up on a wet, stormy day from her job at the Falcon Woolworths store on December 12 last year. The popular teenager was reported missing by her mother when she did not return home after work that evening. Garth was arrested by Major Crime squad detectives at 7.45pm the following night. Police found Jessie's body about 36 hours later in a shallow bush grave near Tim's Thicket, a popular fishing and four-wheel-drive spot at Bouvard, about 10km south of Mandurah. Garth, who has been in custody since his arrest, will be sentenced on September 5 after the court obtains pre-sentence and psychiatric reports. Jessie's mother Judy Cate and friends and family were in the court's public gallery to see Garth plead guilty. Many started crying when he admitted the crime. Outside court Mrs Cate told reporters that being spared the emotional turmoil of going through a harrowing trial was a big relief, but the family remained devastated by their loss and nothing would bring Jessie back. Mrs Cate called for convicted murderers to be sentenced to life without parole, saying her family had been given "a life sentence.'' "I just want tougher sentencing for future families, that they don't have to go through what we're going through,'' Mrs Cate said. "We've already got a life sentence so it's only fair that prisoners should get a life sentence as well. Life for life. "We just need to move on and get on with living without Jess.'' http://www.news.com.au/national/guilty-plea-jessie-cates-mum-calles-for-life-sentence/story-e6frfkvr-1226374757223#ixzz1wLx5T2xO http://www.smh.com.au/wa-news/pinjarra-man-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-teenager-jessie-cate-20120530-1ziiy.html http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/fears-for-missing-dawesville-teen/story-e6frg143-1226222543572

News (8-6-2010)- "Pedophile lived next to child care" A convicted pedophile, who was caught living next to a child care centre, had videos of children crying on his mobile phone, a court was told. Police allegedly discovered Christopher Noel Gay was living next door to an Ipswich child care centre last week. Gay was convicted in 2002 of seven charges of indecent treatment of a child aged under 12 and one charge of indecent assault relating to offences committed in 1993 and 1994. He was sentenced to two years jail wholly suspended for four years and was declared a registered child sex offender for 15 years. People placed on the Child Protection Offender Registry must report to police annually and tell the authorities about any change in residential address, job or car registration. But police allege Gay failed to report after being released from prison, failed to keep his annual reporting obligations and did not inform police that he started living next to the child care centre. Gay was arrested on Friday and pleaded guilty to traffic offences. But the 45-year-old was released from custody after being granted bail in Ipswich Magistrates Court before detectives could provide a formal objection. Police arrested Gay again on Saturday and yesterday successfully applied to revoke his bail. Prosecutor Sergeant Kevin Carmont told the court Gay provided the address next to the child care centre when he was given bail on Friday. It causes a great deal of alarm to the community at large and the prosecution, Sgt Carmont said. Sgt Carmont said Gays phone contained photos and video footage of crying children, which while not of a sexual or criminal nature, was worrying. Defence lawyer Amanda Robinson said her client, who is unemployed, did not realise the home was next to a child care centre. But Magistrate Donna MacCallum pointed out Gay allegedly told police he had lived at the home from time to time. Ms Robinson said Gay believed he only had to report annually for eight years and could live with his sister in Inala  but the address is within one kilometre of a primary school. Ms MacCallum refused bail and Gay was remanded in custody. Gay is expected to next face court on three charges of failing to comply with reporting conditions on July 2. http://www.qt.com.au/story/2010/06/08/sex-offender-moves-next-to-child-care/

News (28-3-2012)- "Federal Court approves sex fiend's visa"- A Gillard government bid to cancel the visa of an African paedophile who impregnated a 12-year-old has been rejected by the Federal Court. Immigration Minister Chris Bowen tried to have Thomas Scott Gbojueh's humanitarian visa cancelled on character grounds. But Gbojueh appealed to the Federal Court and Mr Bowen's decision was overturned on Friday. The Government said it was disappointed by the ruling and was seeking legal advice on its options for appeal. In 2009, Gbojueh was convicted and jailed after pleading guilty to twice having sex with his lover's daughter. The girl was 12 at the time of the offences. The Immigration Department tried to cancel the Liberian refugee's visa, but the Administrative Appeals Tribunal last year rejected the department's decision. The tribunal said Gbojueh feared persecution in Liberia and, while he had been convicted of a serious crime, he was deemed a low risk of reoffending. After that decision, Mr Bowen stepped in to set it aside in a bid to cancel Gbojueh's visa. That was rejected by the Federal Court on Friday. A spokesman for Mr Bowen said the Government was now considering its options to appeal. "The decision is disappointing and we are urgently looking at legal options," he said. Opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison urged Mr Bowen to use his powers to take further action. Mr Morrison said the Coalition would support the minister in taking "any action under these powers" to ensure a convicted paedophile was not released in Australia. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/true-crime-scene/court-approves-sex-fiends-visa/story-fnat7dhc-1226311904009 News (4-5-2011)- "African pedophile wins reprieve on persecution fears"- THE Gillard government's attempts to deport a pedophile African refugee who impregnated a 12-year-old girl in Australia have suffered a setback, after the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled he could not be returned to Liberia because he fears persecution. Immigration Minister Chris Bowen was last night seeking legal advice after the tribunal overruled his department's decision to cancel the visa of Liberian refugee Thomas Scott Gbojueh despite admitting he "plainly" failed the government's character test. In 2009, Gbojueh, 43, was sentenced to 27 months' jail after pleading guilty to twice having sex with his lover's daughter, with the first offence taking place less than four months after he arrived in Australia from West Africa.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/african-pedophile-wins-reprieve-on-persecution-fears/story-fn59niix-1226049421427

News (25-10-2007)- "Tutor confesses to child porn" A former casual tutor of the University of Melbourne has been convicted in Broadmeadows Magistrates' Court of possessing more than 7000 images of child pornography. Andrew Gemmell, 58, of Moonee Ponds pleaded guilty to charges of possessing child pornography and transmission of child pornography. The court heard detectives from the Sexual Crimes Squad raided Gemmell's home in February 2006 and found a laptop computer downloading a child pornography file. In a prosecution summary tendered to the court by Acting Sergeant Kerrie Bullman, police found the 7750 child pornography images, some of the which depicted boys under 14 performing sex acts. Police also found Gemmell had saved more than 100 child pornography movie files and and had shared about 1800 pornographic images with other internet users. Clinical psychologist Bernard Healy said in evidence he conducted a series of tests on Gemmell which showed he had a "quite superior intelligence' but suffered from social anxiety. Mr Healy told defence barrister Nick Papas that Gemmell did not "qualify as a pedophile" as in seeking out children. "I don't see him as being a risk of further offending," he Mr Healy said. In his sentencing, Mr Kumar told Gemmell: "I say to you now, they are somebody's children (from) a third-world country and they've been exploited, exploited badly." He sentenced Gemmell on both charges to nine months jail to be served in the community on an intensive correction order. Gemmell has also been placed on the sex offenders registry for a period of eight years. The University of Melbourne's media spokeswoman told The Age that Gemmell had been a casual tutor at the university who resigned earlier this year. http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/tutor-confesses-to-child-porn/2007/10/25/1192941230790.html|/images/andrew_rodney_gemmell_2.jpg

That order means James Georgetown has to serve at least 80 per cent of his sentence before he is eligible for parole.|James Richard Vincent Georgetown - Rapist - 8 offences, including 4 counts of rape and assault occasioning bodily harm.. Victim was a 15 yr old girl. "Jail for teen's rapist" (5-9-2013) Townsville primary school has been labelled a "predator" worse than the Riverway Rapist, and jailed for 12 years. James Richard Vincent Georgetown, now 21, lured his then-15-year-old victim to the grounds of Rasmussen State School in the late hours of August 16, 2011, after asking her to help him look for "Nicky boy". While the pair were talking on a classroom verandah Georgetown attacked her, biting her jaw and raping her four times in different, "vulgar" ways. Judge Clive Wall QC said while sentencing Georgetown yesterday that his actions were worse than those of Trevor James Benjamin, who was dubbed the Riverway Rapist after attacking a jogger in 2010. Benjamin king-hit the 19-year-old woman before raping her near Vickers Bridge. "The injuries (inflicted by) Benjamin were more serious than the injuries here, (but) this is in overall terms worse," Judge Wall QC said. Georgetown was found guilty of eight offences, including four counts of rape and assault occasioning bodily harm, after a five-day trial in July. Judge Wall QC sentenced him in Townsville District Court yesterday to 12 years' jail, a term that automatically attracts a Serious Violent Offender order. That order means Georgetown has to serve at least 80 per cent of his sentence before he is eligible for parole. "You were behaving almost as a predator, looking for women that night and finally ended up with a child," Judge Wall QC said. "You took advantage of the fact she trusted you." During the trial, jurors heard that Georgetown had been looking for someone to sleep with earlier that night. He had asked to be set up with a girl and later sent another child a text message saying "I want you bad". The 15-year-old girl wrote in a victim impact statement, read out to the court, that she felt angry and scared since the assault. "I only really felt safe when I was with my mum so I stayed with my mum all the time," she said. Crown prosecutor Michael Cowen said the offences were vicious and vulgar, and called for a jail term between 10 and 14 years. "This is not a case where the defendant had any genuine amorous intentions towards the child," he said. "He basically wanted sex with anyone that night." Defence barrister Darin Honchin said the Riverway attack of Benjamin was worse than his client's. He said Georgetown lacked "parental role models" but conceded that didn't excuse the offence. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2013/09/05/388522_news.html

News (15-6-2011)- "Man jailed for trying to lure girls" A Victorian man who sent naked pictures of himself online to police  who were posing as teenage girls on the internet  has been jailed. Leigh Gerber, 36, asked the police, who he thought were 13- and 14-year-old girls, to meet up with him after chatting with them online between September 2009 and April 2010, the Victorian County Court heard today. During the sexually-charged conversations Gerber, who pretended to be a 25-year-old single man, sent the undercover police naked pictures of himself. He also encouraged the fictitious teenagers to send him naked pictures of themselves, the court heard. Gerber was arrested last April at Geelong railway station, where he believed he had arranged to meet two of the girls but was instead arrested by police. While on bail he again chatted online with police posing as teenage girls, but was not charged, the court heard. Judge Paul Lacava jailed Gerber for two-and-a-half years and ordered he serve six months of the sentence, with the remainder suspended for two years. He said Gerbers offending was premeditated and deliberate and took place even though he knew the age of the girls. Judge Lacava said the internet chatting was both sexually suggestive and salacious. Gerber, of the Geelong suburb of Leopold, pleaded guilty to three counts of using a carriage service to procure a child under 16. He will be a registered sex offender for life. http://www.news.com.au/national/man-sent-nude-pics-to-police-posing-as-teens/story-e6frfkvr-1226038697241 http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/grooming-charges-20100409-rysy.html|/images/leigh_gerber_2.jpg

The woman then attacked him, forcing him to fall out of a window and on to her car parked below.. 2 previous convictions for attacks on women. News (26-9-2012)- "Wheelchair-bound rapist Philip Arthur Gilchrist granted supervised release from jail" A wheelchair-bound sex predator who is a "serious danger to the community" and whose "future risk of sexual reoffence is high" has been granted supervised release from jail. Convicted serial rapist Philip Arthur Gilchrist, 51, was last week granted release from jail and allowed to live in the community by a Brisbane Supreme Court judge the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. Gilchrist has a long history of sexual offending but his final attack made headlines in 1997 for two reasons. Firstly, his victim successfully sought permission from the then Attorney-General Matt Foley to speak publicly to the media as part of her healing process. Secondly, it was revealed Gilchrist had been injured when his victim attacked him with a dumb bell forcing him to fall several floors from an open window. In November 1997, Gilchrist was sentenced to 13 years jail for the attack on the woman in her near-city unit. Gilchrist had randomly selected the woman's home and scaled a drainpipe to enter her third-level unit through the bathroom window. He held a knife to her throat before raping her. The woman then turned the tables on Gilchrist, attacking him and forcing him to fall out of a window and on to her car parked below. Gilchrist had two previous convictions for attacks on women - one for raping a woman in a toilet block and raping another woman after scaling a pipe and breaking into her unit. Justice Martin Daubney, in a written decision handed down on Friday, said expert medical evidence to the court demonstrated Gilchrist remained a serious danger to the community. However, he said the same experts also concluded Gilchrist could be managed appropriately if he was released under a "strict supervision order." The court was told one medical expert also questioned Gilchrist's need for a wheelchair, saying the alleged "atrophy of the legs" had been used in jail to "shirk work." "I ... record, lest there be any doubt, that the evidence before me is acceptable, cogent evidence which persuades me to a high degree of probability ... to justify me making a decision that (Gilchrist) represents a serious danger to the community," Justice Daubney said. "Doctors (who testified also) ultimately concluded, in the evidence before me that (Gilchrist) could be managed appropriately under a strict supervision order." Gilchrist will be forced to obey 34 conditions as part of the order, including that he submit to a curfew and electronic monitoring. http://www.news.com.au/national/wheelchair-bound-rapist-philip-arthur-gilchrist-granted-supervised-release-from-jail/story-fndo4ckr-1226481688808

"Pedophile priest Michael Glennon dies" (1-1-2014) Notorious pedophile Catholic priest Michael Charles Glennon has died in prison. Corrections Victoria spokesman Mario Xuereb confirmed on Wednesday that Glennon, 69, died overnight of natural causes at the Hopkins Correctional Centre in Ararat. Glennon was serving a 14-and-a-half year sentence with a 10-year minimum for child sex offences. In 2003, a court heard that he faced 30 charges for molestation against four victims between 1983 and 1991. Most of the offences were committed at youth camps held at Karaglen, a rural property at Lancefield, north of Melbourne, which Glennon helped operate. The former priest was convicted of sexually abusing 15 children between 1974 and 1991, mostly at Karaglen. Broken Rites, victim support group researcher, Dr Bernard Barrett said the Glennon case is of Australia-wide significance. "Until Glennon was first jailed in 1978, abusive priests seemed to be immune from prosecution," Mr Barrett said. He said Glennon's 1978 jailing prompted his victims and other victims of clergy abuse to come forward. "The children in Glennon's court cases were not his only victims, they were merely those who eventually spoke to the police," Mr Barrett said. "The world will never know exactly how many children Father Glennon abused. Even Glennon himself would have lost count of the real number." Taking to Twitter, broadcaster Derryn Hinch tweeted: "Good News to start 2014. Just heard evil paedophile priest Michael Glennon is dead. Died where he belonged: in jail. Victims rejoice."

Police raided his home seizing 17 computer disks and two hard drives.. The disks and computers contained in excess of 23,000 images and 250 video files of child pornography..Most images depicted girls as young as 5 yrs old. Man gets jail term for porn images (22-7-2006) Described by his defence as socially isolated and lacking maturity Daniel Brian Gomersall amassed more than 23,000 images of child pornography over two years. Yesterday he paid for the crime with a three-month prison sentence after pleading guilty in Rockhampton District Court to copying and possessing child abuse images and videos. Prosecutor Justin Whalley said police raided the former IT contractor's North Rockhampton home in September 2004 seizing 17 computer disks and two hard drives. The disks and computers contained in excess of 23,000 images and 250 video files of child pornography. Most images depicted girls as young as five exposing themselves and posing naked or partially clothed. However some of the more sinister files include young girls involved in sexual acts with other children or adult males. Mr Whalley said when questioned by police Gomersall admitted he "preferred downloading pictures of girls that didn't show any signs of development.'' Gomersall also told them he copied the files on to CDs so he would have back-ups if his computer failed. He said he gained access to the images by joining pornographic websites and paying for images with a credit card. But defence barrister Jeff Clarke appealed for Gommersall's sentence to be suspended arguing he hadn't tried to distribute the images and wasn't involved in a file sharing ring. And he emphasised that there was no suggestion his client had been involved in child abuse himself. Mr Clarke said since his arrest Gomersall had been attending regular counselling sessions with a Brisbane psychiatrist at his own expense. He said while his client had not been diagnosed with any specific mental condition his psychiatric assessments had noted he was lacking the maturity of men his age and was socially issolated. Judge Grant Britton rejected Mr Clarke's submission to suspend Gomersall's sentence ruling a term of imprisonment was required to reflect the serious nature of the offence. Once released, Judge Britton ordered he be placed on probation and continue counselling. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/apn-man-gets-jail-term-for-porn/65158/

Had more than 24,000 child porn images on his computer. News (8-8-2009)- "Jail for 24,000 kid sex images" An Ipswich man caught with more than 24,000 child porn images on his computer will spend one year behind bars. Ipswich District Court heard Neil James Gorman, 38, visited pornographic websites between April 2006 and April last year, downloading 24,874 child exploitation images and 19 videos onto his computer. The images depict children from infants to about 16-year-olds in sexual poses, performing sexual acts with other children and between adults and children. Some of the images were in the worst category, showing adults having sex with children. Australian Federal Police searched Gormans house in Brassall on May 15 last year after receiving information from Interpol. Commonwealth Prosecutor Deborah Mayall said the images depicted thousands of children and downloading the material created a market for people to make it. This is not a victimless crime, she said. Ms Mayall said there was no indication Gorman would have stopped downloading child porn if he had not been caught. The key considerations in this case are that the accused accessed child pornography over a long period of time from a large number of websites, she said. Gorman pleaded guilty to possessing child exploitation material and using a carriage service to access child pornography. Defence barrister Geoff Seaholme said Gorman had been receiving a disability support pension after injuring his back at work and eventually gave up working due to pain. He said he started accessing adult porn and one thing led to another, he said. Mr Seaholme said of 7100 images analysed, only 20 images were in the worst category. The bulk of the 24,000 images fell into category one, posing, rather than any explicit acts, he said. Gorman was sentenced to eight months in prison for possessing child porn and two years for using a carriage service to access child pornography material, to be served concurrently. He will be released after one year on a $500 security, with a good behaviour order for five years. http://www.qt.com.au/story/2009/08/08/jail-24000-kid-sex-images/

Victim was a 12 yr old girl. News (6-5-2011)- Bendigo Advertiser- Jarrod Nadort pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16. His friend, Dale Goss, 25, of Golden Square, pleaded guilty to one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16. At the pre-sentence hearing for all matters, prosecutor Patrick Southey called for a sentence of seven to 10 years with a non-parole period of five to seven years for Nadort, and two to three years jail with a non-parole period of 12 to 18 months for Goss. Judge Rachelle Lewitan said Nadorts offending was very serious, considering the violent nature of the rape and the fact that the victim was affected by alcohol. Nadort will be eligible for parole after seven years. Goss was sentenced to two years jail with a non-parole period of 16 months. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/rapist-gets-10-years/2154635.aspx News (3-6-2010)- "Girl, 12, rape charges"- Two Bendigo men have been charged with the rape of a 12-year-old girl. The men, both in their 20s, are alleged to have consumed drugs and alcohol and had sex with the girl in full view of their friends despite her pleading with them to stop. Long Gully man Dale Goss, 25, and Jarrod Nadort, 23, of Lockwood were arrested on Tuesday after the girl made a report to police. They appeared in the Bendigo Magistrates Court yesterday afternoon for a bail application. It was opposed by police on the grounds that the charges were of such a serious nature that the men were considered a flight risk. Prosecutor, Leading Senior Constable Dave Somerton said police also believed the men would interfere with prosecution witnesses and endanger the safety of the victim if allowed back into the community. Despite their concerns Magistrate Jennifer Tregent granted bail. Detective Senior Constable David Newman from the sexual crimes squad said Goss and Nadort picked up a group of people, including the girl, from KFC in Bendigo on Saturday night. He said the group then drove to Nadort's bungalow at his parents' house where they consumed alcohol and the two men smoked cannabis. While in the Bungalow, the court was told, Nadort began touching the girl and had sex with her on a bed. "She was telling him to stop, she was trying to push him away," Detective Senior Constable Newman said. Nadort is alleged to have had sex with the girl a second time that night. He is alleged to have followed the girl out to a rear shed, pushed her onto a mattress and tried to remove her clothes. When she struggled he allegedly slapped her across the face and then had sex with her. Goss is alleged to have had sex with the girl on a couch inside the bungalow. Detective Senior Constable Newman said the girl awoke to find Goss standing over her naked. He then removed her clothes and lifted her on top of him while he sat on the couch and they had sex, the court heard. Two other people who were present at the time have made statements to police alleging they witnessed Nadort and Goss have sex with the girl. Both men deny the allegations. Nadort is charged with two counts of rape, two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16, one count of common law assault and one count of indecent assault. Goss is charged with one count of rape, one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and one count of common law assault. They will return to court in September. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/girl-12-rape-charges/1848098.aspx|/images/dale_goss_2.jpg

News (10-11-2010)- "Addict admits to downloading porn" A self-confessed child-porn addict admitted to having continued to download offensive images during a rehabilitation session for known sex offenders. Ipswich District Court heard Darren James Gough, 35, was reported to police in September 2009 after telling a counsellor that he was still in possession of child exploitation material, despite being on a suspended sentence and parole for a similar offence. Police later conducted a search of Goughs home computer where they found 141 confirmed child exploitation images and 19 videos. Downloaded between August 3, 2008 and August 28, 2009, the material included actual images and footage of children as well as computer-generated images, and had been saved on to compact discs. Crown prosecutor Clayton Wallis said some of the computer-generated material depicted children aged as young as four, while the worst of the real-life material was of a highly distressing nature. These images are of a very depraved category, Mr Wallis said. Defence barrister Steve Kissick said his client underestimated the gravity of his offending until he attended rehabilitation. He was in the grip of an addiction, Mr Kissick said. Upon his sentence for prior offences in May 2009 he stopped downloading real images and started on computer-generated images. He fully appreciates now that computer-generated images are also considered child-exploitation material. Gough pleaded guilty to three counts of using the internet to access child pornography and one count of possessing the material. In sentencing, Judge Sarah Bradley said she noted that Gough had taken significant steps to address his problems. Gough was sentenced to a total of six months behind bars  with a parole release date set at May 8 next year. He will be on probation for the next three years. http://www.qt.com.au/story/2010/11/10/child-porn-addict-rehab-crime-court-ipswich/

"Rapist told woman her children would die" (5-11-2013) A Perth man has been jailed for 11 years after breaking into a woman's home, threatening to murder her sleeping children and then brutally raping her - before forcing her to drive to an ATM and withdraw cash. Cameron John Graham, 22, will have to serve at least nine years after the offence that Judge Christopher Stevenson said almost defied description. It was just three weeks after Graham had been released from a previous prison stint, and after a three day drug bender, when he broke into the Beeliar home and found the woman with her six-year-old son and four-year-old daughter. After confronting the woman in her bedroom, Graham told her the children, who were sleeping downstairs, would die if she did not comply. He forced the 36-year-old to undress before repeatedly raping her in a walk-in wardrobe. Graham then ordered the distraught woman to drive him to a nearby cash machine, where she withdrew $400. As they returned to her house, Graham callously asked if he could "come back and do it again". Judge Stevenson said Graham had subjected the woman to an ordeal no person should have to endure, being forced to choose between personal degradation or her children's safety. "You behaved with increasing bravado and a diminishing concern or respect for her family," Justice Stevenson said. "The offending is of such gravity it is difficult to find words as a human being to describe the nature and depravity of it." Perth District Court was told the woman and her family had since moved overseas to try escape the trauma of the attack. In a victim impact statement, the woman said Graham had seemed to "delight" in the power he wielded over her. For a string of offences including robbery, aggravated burglary and aggravated rape, Graham was jailed for a total of 11 years, with a parole period of nine years. .|/images/cameron-john-graham-2.jpg

"Jailed for filming children at Christmas pageant" (29-4-2011) A freelance artist has been jailed for taking explicit footage of children at the Christmas pageant. The District Court yesterday ordered that Edward Vaughan Green, 54, of Devon Park, spend at least six months behind bars for his crimes. He had earlier pleaded guilty to three aggravated counts of possessing child pornography. Those offences also included secretly filming his then-partner's daughter in her bed and in the shower, and other children at the beach. In sentencing yesterday, District Court Judge Wayne Chivell said Green's "strategic" crime preyed on the innocence of children. "You took advantage of their innocence and the fact that they were concentrating on the pageant," he said. "Clearly this filming had been done surreptitiously.'' Green's obsession was discovered by police who pulled him over for a minor traffic offence in 2009. It was then that they found a camera containing some of the footage wrapped in brown paper on the front seat of his car. Judge Chivell jailed Green for 18 months with a non-parole period of six months in view of his attempts at rehabilitation. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/jail-for-filming-children-at-christmas-pageant/story-e6frea83-1226046528866

See Co-Offender - Norman Kernan "Men jailed for gunpoint rapes of women tourists" (27-9-2013) Two 18-year-old men have each been sentenced to 15 years in prison for the gunpoint rapes of two women tourists at Alice Springs. In the Northern Territory Supreme Court, Justice Dean Mildren chose to sentence the offenders, Ginger Green and Norman Kernan, under the Youth Justices Act rather than the Sentencing Act. Both were juveniles aged 17 when they repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted a Finnish woman and a German woman visiting Alice Springs. The court heard how the women had been camping in their four-wheel drive vehicle in May 2012 when the offenders smashed the windows and raped them at gunpoint. In a court sitting at Alice Springs this afternoon, the pair were convicted on eight counts of sexual intercourse without consent, and one count of armed robbery. Justice Mildren said these were outrageous offences, with devastating consequences for the victims. Suppression orders preventing the men's identity from being revealed were revoked yesterday. Justice Mildren set non-parole periods of nine years for both men. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-27/alice-springs-gunpoint-rape-of-tourists-men-sentenced-to-jail-n/4985712 http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-25/alice-springs-women-tourists-sex-assault-plea-hearing/4980062

News (28-6-2007)- "Jailed paedophile ring 'abusing young prisoners'"- A group of convicted Aboriginal paedophiles are abusing young indigenous prisoners in an Alice Springs jail, according to prison sources. Insiders have gone public with the information amid fears the Federal Government's crackdown on child sex abuse in the Northern Territory could flood prisons with more dangerous sex offenders. There are reportedly 44 paedophiles at the Alice Springs jail, who are accommodated with 350 other inmates. In one incident earlier this year, Harrison Green, 47, and another man allegedly lured a 19-year-old facing burglary charges into a cell and forced him to have sex. Territory Police say Green, who is already serving an indefinite sentence for horrific sex crimes against children as young as eight, will be charged on summons for having sexual intercourse without consent inside the prison. "It's disgusting. A hard core group of convicted sex offenders has been preying on young vulnerable inmates for years," a prison source told the Sydney Morning Herald. The source added that inmates in their teens facing non-sexual offences were often put in dormitories with sex offenders. The president of the Northern Territory Prison Officers Association, Rick Drake, confirmed there was a serious problem with sex offenders mixing with other prisoners. Drake, who used to work at the Alice Springs prison, said the abuse has been happening there since at least 2000. Segregating sexual predators from other prisoners could be a solution, Drake said, but there were not enough segregated facilities in Alice Springs to make it possible. http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/275674/jailed-paedophile-ring-abusing-young-prisoners
NATHAN DANIEL GREEN (Nathan Green) (QLD - Rockhampton, 2011)|28 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in November- 2011, in the Rockhampton District Court to 2 yrs and 9 months jail - 9 months non parole.. will be on good behaviour and probation upon release.|Nathan Daniel Green- Pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing child exploitive material and one count of using a carriage service to obtain child pornography.. Green was found with over 180,000 child pornography images Man had 180,000 child porn files (21-11-2011) A man found with over 180,000 child pornography, real and animated, images and videos was on the verge of causing distress to himself or others when picked up by police. The Rockhampton District Court heard this in statements made by a psychologist in a report about the offender who had accessed the material over a 20-month period. Nathan Daniel Green pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing child exploitive material and one count of using a carriage service to obtain child pornography. The 27-year-old, who was 22-24 years old at the time of the offences, accessed and paid to view 10 child pornography websites between January 31, 2007, and October 11, 2008. He also admitted to police that he'd used a mobile phone device to view images. Crown Prosecutor Dearne Galbraith said police identified the defendant when he used his details to subscribe to two child pornography websites. "The amount of material in this matter is extremely large," she said. Ms Galbraith said Mr Green's actions were not spontaneous or impulsive and he had retained 99% of the materials he had accessed on the websites. She said the majority of the images were of children under the age of 12. "He did admit (during a police interview) to becoming sexually aroused by child porn," Ms Galbraith said. Defence Barrister Tom Polley said Mr Green had undergone a psychology assessment conducted one year ago, and sought counselling afterwards, with the psychologist's report stating Mr Green, at the time of apprehension, was well on the way to paraphilia, namely paedophilia. This is defined as intense recurrent sexual urges towards, and fantasies about, prepubescent children and on which feelings the individual has either acted or which caused distress or interpersonal difficulty. Mr Polley said the report also noted Mr Green had not yet entered that stage and was no threat to society. He asked Judge Grant Britton to only give Mr Green a head sentence of two or two and a half years, considering Mr Green had not reoffended in the past three years. Mr Green was sentenced to two years, nine months, to be released after nine months, for using a carriage service. He was also sentenced to two years for one count of possessing child pornography, suspended after nine months, and nine months for the second possession charge. All sentences will be served concurrently and he will be on good behaviour and probation after jail. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/young-man-had-180000-child-porn-images-and-videos/1179776/

"Rapist Steven John Greenwood jailed for brutal Kew rape 30 years later after secret DNA test of cigarette butt" (24-2-2014) A nurse who violently raped a woman in her Kew home 30 years ago, and was only caught after police seized a discarded cigarette butt, has been jailed for at least six years. Steven John Greenwood, 59, showed no emotion as the decades old crime was detailed to the court. The nurse and former probation officer broke in to his victim's home in December 1984, bound and gagged her and threatened her with a knife before repeatedly raping her. Greenwood was always a suspect in the crime and was questioned in 1984 and again in 2003. Greenwood was charged in 2012 after a court case task force tracked to his Shepparton home and detectives secretly seized a discarded cigarette butt and sent it for DNA testing, which showed he was 48 billion times more likely than other men in the community to have committed the rape. Today County court judge Gabriele Cannon said the victim was devastated by the attack and required treatment for depression. "You subjected her to a most terrifying ordeal of a prolonged nature," Judge Cannon said. Greenwood was jailed for eight years and ordered to serve at least six. Greenwood has become a born-again Christian and attend mass twice a week in prison. .

Has prior history of sex offences 1969, 1974, 1978. Described as a "sexually predatory psychopath".  News (27-7-2011)- "Child killer Greer to remain locked up"- Child killer Arthur Greer has again been rejected for release on parole, a decade after completing his minimum seven-year jail term for the murder of 14-year-old Sharon Mason in 1983. Attorney-General Christian Porter rejected Greer's application after receiving a report from the Prisoners Review Board. In March, pro bono barrister Jonathan Davies submitted that Greer's longstanding refusal to admit guilt should be seen in light of fresh evidence and he should be granted parole to possibly launch an appeal based on that evidence. Law students working on an "Innocence Project" program at Edith Cowan University discovered aerial survey photographs, analysis of maps and information relating to the manufacture date of pipes submerged in the backyard of a Mosman Park fashion shop owned by Greer at the time of the schoolgirl's disappearance. Greer, 73, was arrested in 1992 after workers found the body. He was convicted of murder in 1994 and jailed for life with a minimum of seven years. Prosecutors argued Greer had buried the body by lifting the floor of his backyard shed and digging a deep hole. According to the parole submission, "fresh evidence as to the position of the shed, not previously known to Mr Greer or those representing him at the time of his trials, has emerged to show it was not in a position to hide the burial". http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/9920558/child-killer-greer-to-remain-locked-up/|/images/arthur_greer.jpg

Pedophile faces life on next offence, judge warns- (9-8-2012) A Brisbane judge has warned a convicted pedophile he faces the very real risk of receiving a mandatory life sentence the next time he commits a child sex offence, no matter how minor. Father-of-four Paul Kenneth Greer, 31, was jailed for twelve months, to be released on parole after two months in custody, on Thursday after pleading guilty in the Brisbane District Court to possessing child pornography over a six week period last year. The court was told in 2005 Greer, then aged 25, was convicted of a number of sex offences relating to a 15-year-old girl he took in as a boarder and then sexually assaulted. Prosecutor Mathew Thompson said Greer's "relationship'' with that child was exposed when the teenager went to police and revealed the illegal sexual affair and that fact she was pregnant. He said Greer was convicted, without a conviction being recorded, by a Beenleigh magistrate on charges of unlawful carnal knowledge, attempted unlawful carnal knowledge and indecent treatment of a child under 16. The court was told in June last year Greer was taken into custody on unrelated matters and that police found 127 images of child exploitation material on his iPhone. Judge David Reid, in sentencing Greer, pointed out to the accused man he had now racked up his second strike and that his next similar offence would result in him serving a minimum 20 years behind bars. "(Greer's) criminal history is very worrying ... (and this) is a serious offence,'' Judge Reid said. "It's particularly serious and he (Greer) should understand that ... (with a third strike offence) I'm talking about 20 years jail.'' Judge Reid was referring to tough new laws passed through Parliament last month. The laws require any person convicted of their third child sex offence receive a mandatory life sentence with a minimum non-parole period of 20 years. A two-strikes policy will only apply to serious sex offenders who have previously been convicted of a sex crime that's punishable by life imprisonment, such as rape. Barrister Jim Veivers, for Greer, told Judge Reid: "That's not enough to scare him (Fien) your honour, nothing will.'' Greer is scheduled to be released on parole on October 8. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/pedophile-faces-life-on-next-offence-judge-warns/story-e6freoof-1226446762143

"Serial rapist Rocky bound after 13 years in jail" (14-5-2013) A dangerous Rockhampton rapist, released after more than 13 years in jail for sexually attacking three strangers in a six-month rampage, was caught masturbating in a shopping centre car park in January. A 20-year-old woman saw Peter Scott Griffin masturbating on January 3 at Stockland in North Rockhampton, resulting in his readmission to jail for another three months' for committing an indecent act in a public place and contravening his supervision order. Now the 45-year-old is to be released again, first to Wacol at Ipswich for treatment under a Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act order, but he then plans to return to Rockhampton. Psychiatrist Scott Harden told Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday that Griffin, who had a hatred of women, felt sexual impulses when he was under stress. He said Griffin recognised he was at high risk of reoffending in January so he had masturbated to relieve the sexual tension he felt. Dr Harden said Griffin appreciated that was not the ideal way to cope but at least he was recognising the risk. He said it would be worrying behaviour if there was an element of the exhibitionism Griffin had displayed when he was younger. The psychiatrist said getting the balance right between supervision and one-on-one counselling was critical to Griffin's release. He said Griffin's sexual behaviour was more likely to be based on previous trauma and sexual abuse than libido. Psychiatrist Josephine Sundin said Griffin used sex as a way to cope with "negative emotionality" and impulsivity. She said he must complete the sexual offender maintenance program on release and have independent psychiatric treatment to reduce his risk of reoffending. Roberta Embrey, who manages high-risk prisoners within Queensland Corrective Services, said the program was offered at Ipswich, Brisbane and Logan but was not available in Rockhampton. She said if Griffin wanted to return to Rockhampton, officials would work with him to find appropriate support there. Justice Martin Daubney said psychiatrists' suggestion of treating Griffin with an anti-libido drug should be explored when he began treatment on release.

Prior in 2009 for importing child pornography. Jail release bid by child porn accused- (7-2-2012) A Perth man jailed for possessing child porn for the second time in three years could be released from prison as early as today. Prasenajit Gunasekera, of Winthrop, pleaded guilty to eight counts of possessing child pornography in Perth's District Court this morning. A State prosecutor told the court Gunasekera was stopped by detectives on Great Eastern Highway, Wooroloo, on August 6, 2010. A search of his car revealed he had a mobile phone with more than 2,600 videos and images of children - the majority of which were considered child exploitation material. When police raided his Winthrop home, they uncovered memory cards, CDs, hard drives, and memory sticks filled with thousands of images of children. The prosecutor said while not all the material discovered by police constituted child pornography, a total of 7460 images and 73 videos were found that were considered to be exploitative. She told the court Gunasekera had a "signficant record" and was at high risk of reoffending, after he was jailed in January 2009 for two years for importing child pornography. The sentence related to an investigation by customs officers who stopped Gunasekera at Perth International Airport in 2007 and found child pornography on various devices in his baggage. A further search of his house uncovered a total of more than 13,500 images. Defence lawyer John Prior said Gunasekera had been in custody for 18 months as he waited for the prosecution to categorise all the images before he could be sentenced. Judge Allan Fenbury said a majority of the material found in Gunasekera's house was "fairly low-grade", though there was a significant quantity of serious material. He sentenced Gunasekera to a total of two years in prison for the eight charges, backdated to August 2010. Gunasekera is eligible for parole. If granted, he will be released immediately. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/jail-release-bid-by-child-porn-accused/story-e6frg13u-1226264861727

SHAUN GUNSTON (VIC)|23 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 3.5 yrs jail - 2 yrs and 1 month non parole. Registered as a sex offender for the rest of his life|Used the internet to groom a 12-year-old girl for sex. Banned from working in schools News (27-2-2012)- "Internet predator jailed for grooming 12-year-old girl for sex"- A man who used the internet to groom a 12-year-old girl for sex has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years' jail with a minimum of two years and one month. Shaun Gunston, 23, had been stood down from his job as an education computer network employee - a position he took after his offending - pending the outcome of his case, the County Court heard. He will now be permanently banned from working in schools. Gunston was 18 when he began to communicate with the grade 6 girl in an online chatroom and - after grooming her for a year - continued a sexual relationship with her until she was 15, Judge Susan Cohen said. The girl has since been emotionally scarred by the relationship and has attempted suicide, but Judge Cohen said it was unclear to what extent other factors in the girl's life had played a part. Gunston's crimes - grooming and penetration offences - were not linked to his employment as a computer technician but happened over a period from August 2006 until December 2008, the court was told. Judge Cohen, who described Gunston as an immature and lonely man who had been bullied at school, said he was "considerably older" than his victim and had the "power to manipulate" the young girl. The court heard Gunston threatened to withdraw his friendship from the girl unless she transmitted graphic images of herself. Once, at a swimming pool complex, he had used a "degree of force" to insist on a sexual encounter with the girl. Judge Cohen said Gunston would be required to be registered as a sex offender for the rest of his life. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/internet-predator-jailed-for-grooming-12-year-old-girl-for-sex/story-fn7x8me2-1226282794499
BRUCE GUY (VIC- Geelong/ Highton)|51 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in the Geelong Magistrates Court, in Feb 2012, to an 18-month community corrections order.|Peeping Tom. News (18-2-2012)- "Pervert spied on women"- A Highton peeping tom has admitted to years of spying on his female neighbours for sexual thrills because it was better than porn. Geelong Magistrates' Court heard Bruce Guy, 51, was caught out in October last year after concerned neighbours installed a night vision digital security camera. He was identified on the tape wearing underpants and work boots. Police prosecutor Leading Senior Constable Geoff Lamb said neighbours around Guy's Greyfern Court home had sighted a prowler for the past eight years. He said police were called on May 23, 2008, after a neighbour noticed a man peering through the windows of a neighbouring property and masturbating. On April 26, 2009, police again attended after two neighbours noticed the man. He fled as they approached. Sen-Constable Lamb said a 50cm gap in Guy's fence had given him access to four neighbouring properties. "On November 9, 2011, a warrant was issued and the accused arrested. He made full and frank admission," he said. Sen-Constable Lamb said Guy also admitted to other incidents that the neighbours were unaware of. "The reason given was 'to satisfy a lack of stimulation and contact with people' and it was 'more realistic to look at real people than pornography'," he said. Guy's defence lawyer told the court his client had a number of "social issues" and was embarrassed by his actions. Magistrate Stephen Myall sentenced Guy to an 18-month community corrections order, which includes sex offender treatment and mental health programs. Mr Myall said he noted the concern of the residents and warned Guy if he returned to court again he would be dealt with more harshly. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2012/02/18/308371_news.html  Search

HAKEEM HAKEEM (VIC)|21yrs old (2007)|Sentenced in January 2007 to 24yrs jail/ 17yrs non parole.|Sudanese refugee. Victims were 2 teenage girls (16yrs) and a 63yr old woman. Convicted of charges including - rape/ false imprisonment/ attempted rape/ intentionally causing serious injury. "Rapist refugee gets 17 years" (31-1-2007) A Sudanese refugee who embarked on a three-day rape spree and sliced an elderly woman's throat will serve at least the next 17 years in jail. Hakeem Hakeem, 21, was yesterday sentenced to 24 years' jail, with a non-parole period of 17 years, for a string of depraved sexual attacks in Melbourne's southeast in March 2005. The Supreme Court heard that, just one month after arriving in Australia, Hakeem set out on a drug and alcohol-fuelled campaign of terror on the streets of Dandenong. After chroming and injecting amphetamines, Hakeem and an associate entered a derelict Scout hall on March 10, 2005, dragged a 16-year-old girl to a toilet and repeatedly raped her. A day later, Hakeem broke into the home of a 63-year-old woman and punched her head and face repeatedly, before biting her and raping her at knifepoint. As he fled the woman's house with cash and credit cards, Hakeem turned to his victim, who lay bleeding and temporarily blinded on the floor, and said: "Sorry, mum; sorry, mum." The woman spent more than a week in hospital recovering from fractures to her eye socket, nose and cheek that she suffered in the savage beating. Justice Murray Kellam said the attack was "beyond the comprehension of any decent person. "The depravity of your sexual attack upon a woman to whom you had just inflicted serious injury is contemptible." In his final attack, on March 12, Hakeem entered a building next to the Dandenong Scout hall and forced his way into a room where he confronted a girl and boy, both 16. Hakeem punched both of them in the face before slicing the girl's clothes off with a razor blade. He then forced the 16-year-old boy to take off his clothes and made the pair have sex. Hakeem then raped the girl four times before the pair managed to flee through parkland. Justice Kellam noted in his sentencing that Hakeem had endured a violent and unstable childhood in Sudan and Egypt and been forced to leave his girlfriend and infant son behind in Egypt. "It does not explain why, having come to the safety of this county, you within weeks so defiled and abused innocent people who had done you no harm," Justice Kellam said. "You found your victims in their own private spaces and imposed your sexual lust on them. The violent and debauched way in which you vilified and degraded your victims is reprehensible in the extreme." Hakeem, who has already served 682 days in prison on remand, will remain behind bars for at least the next 15 years..|/images/hakeem-hakeem.jpg

"Man enters plea over hospital indecent act" (18-7-2013) Two elderly women have been spared having to face their attacker in court after the man accused of raping and indecently assaulting them pleaded guilty to the attacks. Antony Paul Hanney faced Wagga Local Court via an audio-visual link from Junee Correctional Centre to hear his solicitor, Duc Vo, enter guilty pleas to a charge of sexual intercourse without consent and assault with an act of indecency. The charges related to an incident that took place in the St Gerards wing of Waggas Calvary Hospital on an October evening last year. Information provided at the time of the 47-year-olds arrest said he gained access to the hospital outside visiting hours about 9.10pm and entered a room shared by two female patients. He then assaulted a 76-year-old woman as she lay in her bed. He moved into another room of an 86-year-old woman, lifted her night gown and indecently assaulted her by touching her through her underwear. Magistrate Michael Antrum committed Hanney for sentence in the Wagga District Court ordering a pre-sentence report be completed.

JASON PAUL HANNON (QLD- Brisbane)|41 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 16-9-2012, in the District Court in Brisbane, to 18 months jail - suspended after serving 3 months jail.|Jason Paul Hannon- Pleaded guilty to 2 Commonwealth charges of accessing child pronography, and a state charge of possessing child pornography. Man jailed for child porn offences- (16-9-2011) A judge found he had no choice but to jail a man on child pornography charges despite there being many mitigating factors in the case, a court heard today. It was the latest in a string of District Court cases where judges ruled that because child pornography was not a "victimless crime" it tipped the sacles to an actual jail term for defendants. In the District Court in Brisbane Judge Tony Rafter, SC, sentenced Jason Paul Hannon to 18 months jail, to be suspended after three months. Hannon, 40, had pleaded guilty to two Commonwealth charges of accessing child pronography and a state charge of possessing child pornography. Judge Rafter said between September,1 and October 1, 2007, Hannon had paid $US79 to access a child pornography site. He said between August and November 2008 Hannon had visited 10 child pornography websites. When police raided Hannon's house in December 2008 they found 3548 images on his computer and 14 videos all depicting child pornography. Judge Rafter said while 95 per cent of the images were in the least serious category, there had been some in the more serious classifications including young children having sex with adults. He said Hannon was forced to wait more than two years to get a sentence hearing until a separate High Court leave application, about how to charge child pornography cases, was resolved. Judge Rafter said Hannon had a good work history, no previous convictions for similar offences, had overcome difficulties in his life, and had indicated early that he would plead guilty. "But these offences are not victimless and I have concluded the only appropriate sentence is one in which you serve some actual time in custody," he said. http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/man-jailed-for-child-porn-offences/story-fn6ck51p-1226138847913

Harvey abused the girls while he was the director of an after-hours school program. Convicted in February 2012 of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl in late 2010, at an out-of-school hours care program he ran at a public school. "Paedophile worked at two other public schools" (12-12-2012) A man convicted of raping a girl at an Adelaide out-of-school hours care program in 2010 worked in at least two other public schools, the Education Department has revealed. Mark Christopher Harvey was convicted earlier this year of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl who attended the OSHC program he ran at a public school in the north-western suburbs in 2010. The Education Department today said the man worked for OSHC or Vacation Care programs at two other public schools in suburban Adelaide from 1994 to 2006. A statement from the department, supplied after a request by adelaidenow, says the man also worked "for brief periods" as a School Services Officer at two of the three public schools on short-term temporary contracts in 1998 and 2010. As reported by adelaidenow early last month, the man also worked in OSHC and Vacation Care at an Adelaide Catholic school between 2000 and 2004. The department has written to parents at each school to inform them and outline available support services. A spokesman for the department said it was "still seeking some final details and their verification" about other aspects of the man's employment history. "One issue is that as OSHC is run by Governing Councils, they hold the employment records rather than the department, but we are working to recover these," he said. "Similarly records of employment in the non-government education sectors are not available to DECD." .

The court was told Hatten, after the "calculated and premeditated" attack, told prison guards he slashed and punched the man because he was having a "dip" - his word for having a bad day. Prosecutor David Finch said Hatten told prison guards: "I slit his throat and punched him because I was having a dip." When asked what a "dip" was, Hatten said: "Having a bad day." The prosecution has asked Hatten be handed a further nominal 15-year jail term - based on the fact he is already serving an indefinite term. In December 2008, The Courier-Mail revealed Hatten was sentenced to an indefinite jail term for the second time because a judge believed he was still a great risk of killing or causing serious harm. Brisbane Supreme Court Justice John Byrne made the assessment while resentencing Hatten for a vicious attack in which he stabbed a stranger 13 times for no apparent reason. Justice Byrne ordered Hatten serve an indefinite sentence with a nominal sentence of 15 years. He said Hatten had scored a "high level of psychopathy" on an indication scale and psychopathy was untreatable. Justice Byrne noted Hatten had difficulty controlling his rage and aggressive behaviour, even in the controlled environment of a prison. He said the picture painted by expert witnesses was of a man at great risk of killing or causing serious harm were an indefinite sentence not imposed. "Supervision under parole has no realistic prospect of reducing the grave danger that Hatten would kill," Justice Byrne said. In 2005, Hatten, then 22, became the youngest person detained indefinitely under a Queensland law to deter violent crime. Hatten pleaded guilty to attempting to murder Louise Hendriksen, 44, at the Seven Hills Reserve, on Brisbane's southside, in September 2003. The court was told Hatten came across Hendriksen, a stranger, and stabbed her 13 times with a penknife for no apparent reason. He had other convictions for the rape of a 12-year-old girl and assaults on schoolgirls. However, in February 2007, the Court of Appeal sent Hatten's case back to the Supreme Court. Problems arose because Hatten had been sentenced prior to a High Court judgment that states a defendant has to be considered a danger past the end of his nominal sentence to be sentenced indefinitely. Judge Kiernan Dorney, QC, sentenced Hatten to 13 years jail. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/convict-sean-stephen-hatten-blamed-bad-day-as-reason-for-slashing-mans-throat-court-hears/story-e6freon6-1226343511612 News (7-2-2007)- "Violent rapist fights ruling"- THE youngest person in Queensland to be serving an indefinite jail term could have his sentence quashed because of a new legal point. Problems arose because Sean Stephen Hatten was sentenced before the High Court delivered a judgment in a separate case of the Darling Downs Rapist, Jason Buckley, which now dictates the steps for an indefinite sentence. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/violent-rapist-fights-ruling/story-e6freoof-1111112957553|/images/sean_hatten_2.jpg

Porn ring a bid to 'meet friends' (10-4-2012) A Buderim grandfather who claimed he ran a child porn network from his home only so he could meet new people has been jailed for two years. Sentencing 64-year-old Peter Hays, Judge John Robertson called for extra resources to be thrown into the battle against child pornography. Judge Robertson told Hays his jail term should serve as a warning to others in the world of child porn. "If late at night they're accessing this sort of material they should know there is a chance police are watching and that they will be caught," he said. "The law enforcement agencies, albeit under-resourced, understaffed and outnumbered by the almost infinite number of people involved in this sort of activity, are yet still able to enter what people think is their private internet space and bring it to the public's notice (and) bring with it the shame that will follow and the punishment that should follow," the judge said. He told Hays that he and others who watched child porn needed to remember that the images were not of "virtual children". "These are images of real children being abused egregiously somewhere in the world and unfortunately now we know some are in Australia on some occasions. "That's why courts have to impose significant penalties so that in some small way we can express the community's denunciation of this sort of behaviour." Hays had pleaded guilty in the Maroochydore District Court to knowingly possessing child exploitation material, using a carriage service to access and transmit child pornography, and three counts of making child pornography material available. The court was told more than 40% of the files police found on his computer were ranked in the top three most serious categories of child pornography, including sadistic and animated images and videos involving adults. Defence barrister Simon Lewis said Hays claimed to not have an interest in child pornography but only downloaded and shared files to meet homosexual men. "He was sent some child pornography which he immediately deleted," Mr Lewis said. "It seems around the chat rooms he was in, this became more frequent and it led him to believe if he continued to show an interest in this material that these men would communicate with him. "He instructs me that he is not interested in a sexual way in children." Judge Robertson said Hays knew he was involved in activities "that were offensive to any normal human being's sense of morals". Hays will be released from jail in six months. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/porn-ring-a-bid-to-meet-friends/1334929/
WARREN GRAEME HAYTER (Warren Graeme Hayter) NSW (2007) Glen Waverley area in Victoria)|43 yrs old (2007)|Sentenced in 2005..Hayter ordered to remain in custody until April 2008, when he may again apply for release on a supervision order, subject to his completion of the treatment program and stabilisation on anti-libidinal drugs.|Warren Graeme Hayter/ Paedophile/ Repeat Offender..Warren Hayter has a lengthy history of serious sexual offences against boys aged between seven and 12 dating back to 1984. Update - 2012/2013 - We have received information (unconfirmed) that Warren Hayter may be living in the Glen Waverley area in Victoria. . "Serial sex offender kept behind bars" (16-10-2007) Sydney - A serial sex offender who preyed on young boys in NSW, Queensland and South Australia will remain behind bars for another six months. The NSW government applied to extend the jail term of Warren Graeme Hayter for an additional year under tough new laws to keep high-risk child sex offenders behind bars. Hayter, 43, has a lengthy history of serious sexual offences against boys aged between seven and 12 dating back to 1984. He also has admitted committing further offences for which he has not been charged, and has a history of noncompliance with parole, bail and supervision orders. NSW Attorney-General John Hatzistergos applied to keep Hayter in prison, and was granted an interim detention order allowing Hayter to be detained beyond the September 28 expiry of his sentence. Mr Hatzistergos argued Hayter remained at high risk of reoffending and had a record of committing further offences whilst on a good behaviour bond. He was denied access to a custodial sex offenders treatment program for a number of years because he was classified as a high-risk inmate, having previously escaped from jail. Hayter was reclassified and entered the program in January, but he was suspended in August, when a list containing names, descriptions and schools of children taking part in a television program was found in his cell. He admitted the list was "probably about victims of the future", and there also was evidence he was seeking products to counteract anti-libidinal medication, which he has agreed to take. Pictures of young boys were found in his cell the previous month. A number of prison psychologists told NSW Supreme Court Justice John Hislop that Hayter was at high risk of recidivism and needed at least six months further intensive custodial treatment. In his report to the court, Professor David Greenberg said without anti-libidinal medication, Hayter's chance of fairly rapid relapse was "very, very high". Doctor Stephen Allnut's report concluded it was not feasible to safely manage Hayter in the community "without almost constant supervision". Justice Hislop agreed, saying Hayter's acknowledgement last month that he was planning to reoffend when released was ample reason to keep him behind bars. "The defendant has a history of opportunistic offences against young boys, who very often are unknown to him," the judge said. "The offences frequently occur in public places. "It is very difficult, if not impossible, to protect the community from crimes of the nature here in issue, short of having the defendant under full-time physical surveillance." Justice Hislop ordered Hayter remain in custody until April 2008, when he may again apply for release on a supervision order, subject to his completion of the treatment program and stabilisation on anti-libidinal drugs. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/national/serial-sex-offender-kept-behind-bars www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/scjudgments|/images/warren-graeme-hayter.jpg

News (7-12-2010)- "Black rock offender wins reprieve" A Black Rock man convicted of possessing cruel, disturbing and repugnant child porn movies has escaped jail. Dominic Heenan, 25, was instead given a 12-month intensive corrections order at a County Court appeal. The former cafe owner appealed against a six-month custodial sentence handed down by a Moorabbin magistrate in late August. At the County Court last Tuesday, Judge Gabriele Cannon said the movies, held on a back-up computer disc, were sickening. She accepted testimony from psychologists that Heenan was immature and sexually curious when he downloaded the cruel films, and unlikely to reoffend. As repugnant as the images are and as disturbing as it is, he does have an insight now and it would be a backward step to put him in jail, forensic psychologist Pamela Matthews said. Heenans defence lawyer, Anthony Lewis, said he was of otherwise good character and should be allowed to stay in the community. He said press coverage (Child porn case appeal, Bayside Leader, September 7) had made his life unbearable and cost him a future cafe business. The result of that is he has found himself to be loathed by the people around him, he said. Crown prosecutor Amber Harris said the movies were acts of violation and the sentence should reflect the horror the community felt. Heenan had already been convicted and placed on a sex offenders register for eight years. The intensive corrections order means he must report to police, undergo counselling and do unpaid community work. http://bayside-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/black-rock-offender-wins-reprieve/ http://bayside-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/child-porn-case-appeal/
ANTHONIE ROBERTO HELLEMONS (QLD- Ipswich)|46 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 1997 to 5 yrs jail.. Sentenced March 2011, in the Ipswich District Court, to 18 months in jail - to be suspended after he serves 6 months.|Anthonie Hellemons/ Paedophile/ Repeat Offender - Police raided his home and discovered 10,543 child porn images on his computer and 1119 child abuse movies.. pleaded guilty to 2 charges of indecent treatment of a child aged under-12, and one of possessing child abuse material.. convicted in 1997 of sexually abusing an 11 yr old boy-sentenced to 5 yrs in jail. Dad pays for pedophile threat- (19-3-2011) AN IPSWICH man who confronted a convicted pedophile over allegations of child abuse will spend the next nine months behind bars  while another pedophile caught grooming a boy of 11 is to serve just six months. The two men faced Ipswich District Court in separate hearings as controversy raged over two other sentences passed down by magistrates this week. The sentences which allowed two men who dragged a pony behind their car and a flood-looter who stole an elderly womans jewellery to avoid jail time prompted a furious reaction from Queensland Times readers. In the latest case, a 43-year-old stepfather went to the caravan home of pedophile Alan Francis Mortimer with two other men who are yet to face trial. The defendant, who cannot be named to protect his stepdaughters identity, was incensed when the seven-year-old girl claimed Mortimer had exposed himself to her inside his caravan. Unknown to the stepfather, Mortimer was on bail after being accused of sexually abusing a nine-year-old girl. He was later convicted of that crime and is now serving a two-year jail sentence. The stepfather waited outside Mortimers caravan in February last year while the other men went inside, armed with a bat, and brought him outside. They forced Mortimer, 61, into a car and drove him to where the girl was waiting with her mother. When the girl identified him, Mortimer claimed he was assaulted by the stepfathers accomplices, leaving him with a sore right hamstring. The stepfather was convicted of entering a dwelling while armed and in company and deprivation of liberty, but cleared of assault. Judge Gregory Koppenol sentenced him to 18 months jail to be released on parole on December 17, saying it was important to send a strong deterrence to would-be vigilantes. Crown prosecutor Sarah Dennis said: It was not the defendants job on that day to act as judge, jury and executioner. The Queensland Times understands Mortimer has not been charged over allegations he indecently dealt with the mans stepdaughter. He claimed it was simply a misunderstanding. While the protective stepfather will spend nine months in jail, a convicted sex offender who was caught with more than 10,000 child exploitation images after he tried to groom a young boy received a lighter sentence. Anthonie Roberto Hellemons, 45, yesterday pleaded guilty to two charges of indecent treatment of a child aged under-12 and one of possessing child abuse material. In December 2002, Hellemons invited the 11-year-old Ipswich boy to his house. He sat him on his lap, touched his stomach and stroked his hair while showing him an email which contained photos of nude adults. He then showed the boy a pornographic film. The child complained to his mother, who went to police. Police searched Hellemons home and discovered 10,543 child porn images on his computer and 1119 child abuse movies. Crown prosecutor Clayton Wallis said Hellemons was grooming the child. The court heard Hellemons was convicted in 1997 of sodomising an 11-year-old boy and sexually abusing him with a glass tube and gas bottle and sentenced to five years in jail. Judge Sarah Bradley sentenced Hellemons to 18 months in jail, to be suspended after he serves six months. Hellemons was charged before penalties for child sex offences were increased and the maximum sentence at the time was two years. Defence barrister Steve Kissick said his client believed he should spend no time in jail as he had stayed out of trouble for several years. http://www.qt.com.au/story/2011/03/19/dad-pays-for-pedophile-threat-ipswich/

Pleaded guilty to 59 counts of an indecent act with or in the presence of a child under 16 and two counts of unlawful exposure. Prior - Sentenced to 9 yrs in jail for rape and sexual assault. News (16-3-2010)- "Bicycle flasher Trevor Hemer jailed for more than 10 years"- A SERIAL flasher who exposed himself over 100 times to children as he cycled around Melbourne has been jailed for more than 10 years. Trevor Ross Hemer, 58, of Bonbeach, exposed himself 114 times to children as young as four on 48 separate days between 2003 and January 2009. His offending came only a few years after he was released from a prison after being jailed for rape. In that case, Hemer acted as a bogus doctor who made house calls on migrants who spoke little English, so he could sexually molest children. He again targeted children with this offending, cycling up to them and asking for directions, before exposing himself to them, the Victorian County Court heard today. He asked the children to touch his penis, although none of them did. Hemer told other children he had fallen off his bike and asked them to examine the penis to see if he had injured it. The court heard his acts became more brazen over time with Hemer approaching children playing in the driveway of their home, on busy streets and outside milkbars in suburbs, including Bentleigh, Box Hill, Murrumbeena and Springvale. Police caught him in January 2009 through DNA evidence after he left blood behind when he was chased and injured by two men. Hemer pleaded guilty to 59 counts of an indecent act with or in the presence of a child under 16 and two counts of unlawful exposure. Judge Wendy Wilmoth said his offending left the children upset and fearful. "The offences in this case were brazen and prolific," she said. Judge Wilmoth said Hemer had a large number of victims over a long period and interacted with his victims. The court heard Hemer completed a sexual offenders course while in prison for his rapes in the 1990s, but his treatment stopped once he was paroled. Judge Wilmoth jailed Hemer for 10 years and nine months with a non-parole period of seven years. He will be a registered sex offender for life. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/bicycle-flasher-trevor-hemer-jailed-for-more-than-10-years/story-e6frfku0-1225841519919 http://leader-news.whereilive.com.au/news/story/prison-for-predator-of-oakleigh-huntingdale-children/ http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/sex-pervert-traumatised-114-youngsters-20100301-pdax.html

The photos were passed on to Queensland police who re-interviewed each of the defendants, resulting in new confessions. Henderson admitted to taking many of the photos and being involved in procuring sex acts between the children but was not represented in any of the pictures. Judge Milton Griffin extended each of the men's sentences, handed down in 2005, by 18 months. Andrews will now serve a total of eight-and-a-half years while Henderson will serve nine-and-a-half years and Voigt 10-and-a-half years.

The court heard that Hicks unplugged a baby monitor before striking the child with a baton about 25 times. "Burglar who beat baby Zayden to death should be jailed for life, says prosecutor" (12-5-2014) A burglar who beat a baby to death should be jailed for life, a court has heard. Harley Hicks, 21, was last month convicted of murdering 10-month-old Zayden Veal-Whitting in his cot. Today Crown Prosecutor Michele Williams SC said the gravity of Hicks crime, his lack of remorse and his extensive criminal history showed a bleak prospect of rehabilitation. We say this murder may be categorised as a callous murder of an innocent and defenceless baby. It is an evil killing without any real rational explanation, Ms Williams said. A Supreme Court jury found Hicks entered the infants Long Gully home in the early hours of June 15, 2012 and struck Zayden dozens of times with a makeshift baton in a vicious frenzy. Hicks was on a drug-addled crime spree when he killed the child. Zaydens mother, Casey Veal, discovered her son lifeless in his cot when she woke sometime later. Hicks was found guilty of Zaydens murder, aggravated burglary and two counts of theft after a five-week trial this year in which dozens of witnesses were heard. .|/images/harley-hicks-3.jpg

News (5-3-2010)- "Stress led man to child porn" An Ipswich man who viewed more than 100 child porn images may have accessed the material because he was stressed at work. Police raided the 38-year-old mans Springfield Lakes home in 2008 and seized his computer after receiving information about the offences. Ipswich District Court heard Brentford Paul Higgins had viewed 178 child porn images between October, 2006, and May, 2008, and while he did not save them to his computer, police were able to retrieve them from his temporary internet folders. Commonwealth Prosecutor Kila Pedder said Higgins told police: I didnt need to save any because there was so much content on the internet. Mr Pedder said the children were aged between three and 18 and while most of the images involved only sexual posing, some were in the more serious categories. He said Higgins had exposed himself to a jail sentence of between 12 and 15 months with some actual time spent in custody. The defendant has accessed child porn material over a significant period of time which shows his actions werent impulsive or opportunistic in nature, Mr Pedder said. The court heard a psychiatrists report which said Higgins was under significant work stress and that may be a possible explanation for his behaviour. Higgins pleaded guilty to using a carriage service to access child exploitation material. He was given two years probation and 12 months jail but was released immediately on a $1000 good behaviour bond for three years. Defence barrister Bradley Farr said 32 of the images were cartoon anime child porn in which actual children were not harmed. Of the remaining images, Mr Farr said only 40 to 50 actual children were depicted. Mr Farr said his client had no criminal history and first viewed the material by accident while looking at legitimate adult porn. It would seem that his curiosity was piqued that way in the beginning, Mr Farr said. Mr Farr said Higgins estimated the overall number of adult porn images he had viewed would be in the 10s of 1000s if not more. Child porn wasnt the primary focus of what he was viewing, he said. Mr Farr said Higgins owned a business in Brisbane where he employed 13 people and it was unlikely he would re-offend. Judge Sarah Bradley said while cartoon child porn was abhorrent and accessing it should remain illegal, it was less serious than material which involved actual children. She said it was important for courts to recognise that child exploitation material involved actual victims. http://www.qt.com.au/news/stress-led-man-to-child-porn/482078/

News (22-3-2012)- "Sentence cut for rapist with knife"- A serial prostitute basher may have won an early release from prison after it was deemed his nine-year jail sentence was "manifestly excessive". During a spate of attacks on prostitutes, Michael James Hill held a knife to a Mooloolaba call girl and raped her. The Court of Appeal has ordered Hill be eligible for release from jail on parole this month, more than 18 months before his original parole eligibility date of December 24, 2013. Judges found the original sentence was too severe for Hill's crimes. The 32-year-old arranged to meet the Mooloolaba prostitute in a motel room on June 22, 2009. Once inside the room, he grabbed the woman and held a knife to her throat. He told her that if she did what he said she wouldn't get hurt and proceeded to indecently touch the prostitute and force her to give him oral sex. She told Hill she had AIDS in an attempt to prevent him forcing her into unprotected oral sex, but it did not stop him. During the attack, the prostitute asked why he was doing this to which Hill replied: "Because I hate all you women." He repeatedly told the prostitute "girls are sluts" and said he was "sick of you girls ripping me off". Hill said he would not pay for a prostitute again. Back in his hometown of Gladstone, Hill attacked two more prostitutes less than a month later. The Court of Appeal reduced his original jail sentence of nine years to five years. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2012/03/22/sentence-cut-for-rapist-with-knife/ http://www.gladstoneobserver.com.au/story/2012/03/22/early-release-for-prostitute-basher-jail-sentence-/

"Men walk free over child porn charges" (11-12-2010) A Townsville man who distributed a graphic tutorial over the internet describing how to sexually abuse young children will walk free in just three months after being sentenced yesterday. Timothy Hinspeter, 36, pleaded guilty to one count of distributing and three counts of possessing child exploitation material. On November 18, 2007, police discovered Hinspeter was circulating an explicit pictorial tutorial via a peer-to-peer file sharing site. The four-minute guide detailed how to sexually assault girls from infancy through to 13 years of age. Explicit instructions about different objects that could be used while performing illegal acts were provided. It also specified ideal times to carry out such offences to ensure a spouse would not discover what was going on. The file displayed 39 images of young girls. Hinspeter was arrested on March 5, 2008, after a raid at his home. In addition to the tutorial, police seized his laptop and numerous hard drives, which contained 42 child porn videos, some as long as 45 minutes. They depicted as many as three young children being molested by men. In handing down his sentence, Judge John Baulch SC told Hinspeter: "There is no indication the nature of the offence shocked you or caused you to reconsider or stop what you were doing." Hinspeter was given 18 months' jail for the distribution charge, to be wholly suspended after just three months. He will then be subject to two years' probation. Meanwhile, two other Townsville men also charged as part of Taskforce Argos a Queensland Police investigation targeting the illegal accessing and downloading of child pornography have pleaded guilty and walked from court. Ashley Kenneth Kearns, 48, and Peter Andrew Morgan, 42, both appeared this week in the Townsville District Court. Judge John Baulch SC said the pair, who were regular visitors to pornographic websites that offer illicit images and videos of underage children, was involved in a "disgusting trade". Kearns, an ex-employee of Ergon Energy, faced 22 charges. He also appeared on 21 commonwealth charges of using a carriage service, namely the internet, to download child pornography material. He was given two wholly suspended sentences 18 months in jail for the Commonwealth offences and ordered to pay $2000 recognisance, while he was given six months' imprisonment for the state charge. Morgan, a fitter and turner, was charged with two state counts of possessing child exploitation material . He was given a nine-month jail sentence wholly suspended. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/12/11/191771_news.html

Intellectually deficient  court-ordered tests estimate his IQ is between 61 and 69 [an average adult IQ starts at 90]  Michael Richard Hodges has been in and out of the Queensland court system for the past 13 years. On paper the 33-year-old's crimes are among what society considers to be the absolute worse  Hodges's attempts to procure children under the age of 16, and in some cases under the age of 12, via the internet are prolific. The Cleveland resident's modus operandi is always the same - enter an internet chat room, try to identify the younger users, attempt to lure them to meet him for sex. The handles he uses point to his intellectual capabilities. When he was 25, one of his chat room names was 'Michael25'. The following year, it was 'Michael26'. His criminal history, once again read out in a Brisbane District Court on Tuesday, is littered with procurement offences dating back to 2000. In the past he has also pleaded guilty to involving a child in making child exploitation material, using the internet to access child pornography and soliciting a child under 10. He has committed offences while on bail and parole. He has been to prison and completed programs. He has committed offences the day after he was released from prison. The offences have only stopped when he has been incarcerated and under strict 24-hour supervision. This week, wearing cargo pants and a striped jumper zipped all the way to his neck, Hodges faced Judge Terence Martin, SC, with a bemused expression and a slumped posture and pleaded guilty to seven more counts of attempting to procure a child using the internet between June 19 and June 27 last year. It wasn't his first time sitting in the accused dock. And everyone in that court room, from Judge Martin to Hodges's defence barrister, Mark Green, to the two family members who came to support a lonely confused man, knew it wouldn't be the last. This time round, Hodges had been chatting to a police officer when he thought he had convinced 13-year-old "Bree" to meet him for sex at a Brisbane hotel, promising strawberry-flavoured lubricant and gentleness. When officers arrested him at the arranged meeting place, a train station close to the hotel, he admitted his intentions. In the past, many, many arrests ago, Hodges had been angry. He had told police he wanted what had happened to him as a child to happen to other children. I wanted other people to get hurt like I did, was the sentence from Hodges's 2005 arrest interview that prosecutor Ken Spinaze read out to the court . This time, there was no anger. Just an acceptance that he didn't know how to stop. And the courts don't have the capacity to make him. Hodges's story is, like so many others which are heard within the hallowed walls of court rooms across the country, tragic. His parents had a rocky relationship before splitting for good, his mother taking her simple boy to live in a caravan park where he was abused by a resident in the park's toilets. Without the intellectual capacity to reconcile what had happened to him and without the emotional support of his parents, Hodges drifted, his behaviour becoming increasingly more erratic until he was dumped on his grandparents' doorstep as a 13-year-old. Relatives who had come to court on Tuesday to support him because he has no one else said Hodges' grandparents and other extended family tried to help the young boy. He was sent to an exclusive private school but was hopelessly outclassed by almost every other student in every field. When he left school he was still incapable of taking care of himself, but there was nowhere else to go. His anger and confusion built, his family said, until he began to seek an outlet for it. That outlet was the internet. Each jail sentence has made him just a little more savvy when he comes out. His father, whom he has lived with since his last stint in prison, is ill. His extended family, good people from all accounts, know his behaviour is reprehensible but they also know he doesn't have the capabilities to truly understand why his behaviour is so wrong. It was when his dad went back into hospital that Hodges' behaviour once again spiralled out of control. Bored and housebound, he again turned to chat rooms, where, police, as they have since the mid-2000s, were waiting for him. Arrested on June 29, 2012, he has been in jail since, waiting for his court date. When it came to sentencing Hodges for his latest infraction, Judge Martin could only shake his head. It's a tragic case, he said to Mr Green, the defence barrister. This is a clear situation, it seems to me, where your client plainly has intellectual deficits and no doubt he has had and will have a terrible life. And on the other hand ... the community is entitled to protection from him because his prospects of rehabilitation are very poor. It's a terrible situation." The courts can only sentence people like Hodges within the parameters of what the law allows. Outside of jail, the state can't afford for people like Hodges to live structured lives where they are monitored by trained employees. So it falls back on families and an over-worked parole system to fill the gap. Your personal circumstances invoke sympathy, however your history is such that it is plain you pose a great threat to the community, Judge Martin said in sentencing. Rehabilitation in your case is most unlikely. The risk of you re-offending, in my view, is very high. The community is entitled to protection from you. Judge Martin sighed and then issued the only sentence he could. Three years in prison. No parole date was set. Hodges, already standing, and having previously used the toe of his white sneaker to play with the top of his foot, said OK and looked to his lawyer like he was being taken on a school excursion. He all but ignored his family in the court, only looking at them once and then away very quickly, like a child whose hand had been caught in the cookie jar and was trying to hide his crime. After a brief chat with his lawyer, Hodges lumbered towards the door in the custody of correctional services. He smiled briefly at anyone's eyes he could meet, before shuffling through the door. Outside court his relatives released a sigh. It's structure, it is what he needs, one said. He knows what to do each day, he knows when to get up in the morning and that is what he needs. He needs structure and if there was something in the community which offered the same strict structure, we would do that. When asked if his client understood what had just happened, his lawyer just shook his head. As much as he is able, he said. I think he knows it is as good as it is going to get. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/paedophile-leaves-court-and-community-at-a-loss-20130108-2cexd.html#ixzz2PAfz0jqF "'Predator' released after guilty plea" (16-12-2005) One of Queensland's worst Internet predators has been released from jail after pleading guilty to 28 charges of procuring children and indecent treatment. The District Court heard 26-year-old Michael Richard Hodges, from the Brisbane bayside suburb of Cleveland, would visit Internet chatrooms and attempt to procure young children. On one occasion he instructed a person to rape their nine-year-old sister. Judge Gil Trafford-Walker jailed Hodges for three-and-a-half years. However, the judge ordered Hodges be released immediately because he had already served more than 423 days in pre-sentence custody. Speaking outside the court, Senior Constable Kenneth King said Hodges was a prolific offender. "This is certainly the case of the highest number of charges and of persistent offending for this type of offence," he said. The intellectually impaired man was also placed on three years' probation. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-12-16/predator-released-after-guilty-plea/763236

Pleaded guilty on May 9 this year in the Ballarat County Court to 4 counts of an indecent act with a 16 or 17-year-old child. "Sebastopol teacher jailed over indecent acts with student" (18-7-2013) A former teacher at Sebastopol's Phoenix P-12 Community College who "groomed" a female student before committing multiple indecent acts with her, was jailed for more than two years today. Thomas Brian Holding, 54, was the girl's teacher in 2011 when he began a relationship with her that included buying her gifts, fondling and kissing her breasts. Holding pleaded guilty on May 9 this year in the Ballarat County Court to four counts of an indecent act with a 16 or 17-year-old child. In one incident Holding, who was 53 at the time, invited the 16-year-old student to his home while his wife and children were away. The court heard that Holding tried to pull the victims pants down and kissed her on the breasts. After this incident the girl emailed Holding saying what they were doing was wrong and that she was "too young." Holding replied saying that no one ever needed to find out. In another email read to the court Holding wrote to the girl "I'm looking forward to finding more tickly spots." The court heard that the victims mother alerted the school that something sinister was going on after her daughter received gifts from Holding. After been told by the school to stay away from the girl Holding set up a "covert" email account so they could continue to communicate. In sentencing Holding, Judge Lance Pilgrim said he had displayed "classic grooming behaviour" and had used his position of power to manipulate a vulnerable young person. "Your behaviour must be denounced in the strongest of terms," Mr Pilgrim said. "The effect of this type of offending on young people is paramount." Holding was moments away from being sentenced on May 27 this year when he vomited in the dock of the court and fainted. Today, Judge Pilgrim was forced to take Holding's health into account after is was revealed he suffered irregular heart beats and high blood pressure. "I assure you I am conscious of your health problems and have adjusted the sentence accordingly," he said. Judge Pilgrim sentenced Holding to a total jail term of 27 months and placed him on the sex offenders register for life. He will be eligible for parole in 15 months. http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/1580631/sebastopol-teacher-jailed-over-indecent-acts-with-student/

News (21-12-2012)- "Police pursue paedophiles for sharing porn in jail" Convicted paedophiles in Canberra's jail have allegedly set up a pornography ring, sharing electronic images of child sex abuse under the noses of prison guards. Several investigations are under way into how the three prisoners, two of them the ACT's most dangerous child sex predators, were able to obtain and share files containing the material while serving their sentences at the Alexander Maconochie Centre. It is even alleged that a child pornography website was hosted from within the prison before police raided it on Tuesday. The ACT government's Justice and Community Safety directorate is set to come under intense scrutiny to explain how the alleged ring was allowed to develop. The prison's intelligence unit began passing information to jail authorities about the men's suspected activities several months ago but it is unclear what led to the delay in calling in police. Central to the alleged plot was a laptop computer which a fourth prisoner, who has since been released, had permission to bring into the jail despite the misgivings of some guards. The USB drives, which look like cigarette lighters in prison X-ray security screening images, are relatively easy to smuggle into jail and can be plugged into ports on the set-top boxes. The technical expertise is believed to have been developed and shared by an offender, who cannot be named for legal reasons, who served four years of a nine-year sentence for what a judge described as ''premeditated and predatory'' rapes of a 10-year-old boy. The paedophile, an IT expert, was deported to his native South Africa after serving his four-year non-parole period and being found to have behaved well while in jail. But before his release he was allowed to have a laptop computer which allegedly led to the development of the pornography ring. Another man suspected to be involved - Aaron James Holliday - is serving a 16-year sentence for a string of offences against young boys. He has been described as a computer expert. Holliday was alleged by police to have developed an amateurish, and unsuccessful, plot while in jail to silence once of his victims, a 15-year-old boy, by having the youth murdered. Another of the suspects, whose name is also suppressed by the courts, is serving 10 years for several offences, including abusing his one-year-old son and sharing footage of the acts with other online offenders. He was also convicted of possessing 23,549 images and 1013 videos of child pornography and also abused the children of friends to produce the material. The third man is remanded in custody at the jail, awaiting trial for allegedly using a child for the production of pornography and other offences. An ACT Policing spokesman said detectives were examining several devices seized in Tuesday's raid. ''The contents of the computers and devices are being reviewed by AFP Digital Forensics,'' he said. http://www.smh.com.au/national/police-pursue-paedophiles-for-sharing-porn-in-jail-20121220-2bpfj.html News (15-11-2002)- "Schools, scouts to co-operate in commission" One of the ACT's most notorious convicted paedophiles, Aaron James Holliday, was a former trainee leader of the Scouts in 2007, while a member of the older Venturers section group, for members aged 13-18, was convicted of child sex offences against a 13-year-old girl he met in the movement in 2004. -read more- http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/schools-scouts-to-cooperate-in-commission-20121114-29d0c.html#ixzz2H5FQzxSe News (29-11-2010) A Canberra man who had sex with underage boys after telling them they were training to catch paedophiles, will spend at least the next six years behind bars. Aaron James Holliday pleaded guilty to committing an act of indecency on a child, two counts of possessing child pornography and eight counts of engaging in sexual intercourse with minors. The 24-year-old befriended his three child victims before abusing them. He told two of the boys they were being trained for a program called "pedobait" to help police catch paedophiles. He took them to Mt Majura for what he told them was a training session and then engaged in sexual acts with them. When police arrested Holliday they found 11,000 child pornography images on his computer. In sentencing, Justice Richard Refshauge said Holliday deceived his victims in a sinister way and the abuse had long lasting affects on the children. Justice Refshauge took into account Holliday himself had been abused at boarding school. He sentenced Holliday to 14 years and six months in jail, with a non-parol period of seven years from April last year. Call for action- The parents of one of the victims is calling on governments to do more to stop child pornography. The father says child pornography encouraged Holliday to commit the crimes. "The internet industry basically have this lie, where they turn around and say it's not their responsibility," he said. "Well crap, they sell it, they should make sure it's safe for people who buy it and they don't, and the Government doesn't require them to do it. It's about time they did." The boy's mother says while the case has been a nightmare for everyone invovled, the bigger problem is child pornography in general. "I really think governments should stand up, not only pass the laws but to dam well enforce them, and put the resources behind it to enforce the law about chid pornography and pornography generally." But she's relieved the case is over. "It's closure for our boys," she said. "They're really brave. But no one can take any satisfaction out of this horrible situation... it's a nightmare for everyone." "We're pleased the courts have taken the issue seriously and are helping keep our children safe." http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-24/man-jailed-for-having-sex-with-boys/2350156 http://www.mychristiandaily.com/index.php/aus/172-news-item-4-australia-nz/4238-claims-of-paedophile-porn-ring-in-act-jail http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-11/parents-tell-of-anger-over-sons-sexual-abuse/2332492 News (10-5-2007)- " Male nanny porn charge" A male nanny allegedly caught with thousands of pornographic images of children also performed an act of indecency in front of a 12-year-old boy, a Canberra court heard today.

JERVIS MITCHELL HOLLOWAY (TAS - Hobart)|60 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Jervis Mitchell Holloway- Pleaded guilty to 2 counts of maintaining a sexual relationship with a person under the age of 17. Man admits child-sex offences- (25-7-2012) A 60-year-old Hobart man has been remanded in custody after pleading guilty to two counts of maintaining a sexual relationship with a person under the age of 17. The crimes occurred more than 30 years ago. Car salesman Jervis Mitchell Holloway yesterday faced court over a string of sex acts he performed with two young men between 1978 and 1982. The complainants were 14 and 16. Both from sheltered Seventh Day Adventist families, the teens had no sexual experience before their relationships with Holloway who was a decade older than them. Both teenagers were impressed by the lifestyle of alcohol, parties and go-cart racing Holloway offered. The accused, then aged 26, came across his first victim when driving along the Channel Highway. The teen had been dropped off on the side of the road by his mother after an argument and was hitch-hiking. The accused spotted the 16-year-old and offered to take care of him. Later that day Holloway initiated a sexual act in his bedroom and the inexperienced victim complied. The court heard the pair engaged in regular sex acts over the next three years. Defence lawyer David Gunson SC said the pair had maintained a close relationship until the complainant went to police last year. The second teen had been introduced to Holloway by the first complainant and participated in a sexual relationship. "These boys lacked maturity, that naivety would have been something the accused could have quite readily taken advantage of," prosecutor Linda Mason told the court. Mr Gunson said his client had led an industrious life and emphasised both teens had been willing participants aside from being under-age. Justice David Porter will pass sentence on August 7. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/07/25/349241_scalesofjustice.html

Pleaded guilty to assault. News (20-9-2011)- "Jailed for assaulting child"- A Hobart man who punched his five-year-old step-daughter in the face on a busy Hobart street has been sentenced to six months in prison. Nicholas Lee Horne, 29, was charged with punching the young girl in the face with a closed fist so hard that it snapped her neck back. He was also accused of continually kicking the girl as they walked up Davey St in Hobart with the girl's mother and another man on May 4, 2009. Horne pleaded guilty to one charge of assault. He admitted kicking the girl but denied punching her. Justice Alan Blow sentenced Horne in the Supreme Court in Hobart. Justice Blow said Horne and his friend were drunk and had been engaging in various forms of horseplay before meeting the girl and her mother. "When you and your companion first met up with the girl and her mother in the street, you punched the child to the face," Justice Blow said. "The child began crying and screaming. "As you all walked along, you kicked the child repeatedly from behind. "You were kicking her to her buttocks and to her lower back area." Justice Blow said the girl had been placed in the custody of the state since the incident. Her mother had moved interstate. "Although the child did not suffer much physical harm as a result of your assault, the psychological effects of the assault and other ill-treatment, which I do not blame on you, seem to have been enormous," Justice Blow said. "But, most significantly, this was a terrible assault on a defenceless child. "I think imprisonment is the only appropriate penalty." Horne was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/09/20/262811_scalesofjustice.html|/images/nicholas_horne_2.jpg

Also pleaded guilty to possessing child exploitation material. Victims were 4 girls aged from 6 to 15 yrs. News (27-11-2010)- "Magician's evil tricks lured kids"- An Ipswich magician who dubbed himself the man no jail can hold! has been jailed for six years after admitting to sexually abusing under-age girls. Franky Houdini, a magician and escapologist, seduced the teenage girls with promises of a modelling career, but instead took risqu photos and molested them. Ipswich District Court was told Houdini, 36, approached a 15-year-old girl at Riverlink and asked if she wanted to do promotional work. They had a sexual relationship for two months and Houdini dressed her in sexy clothing, photographed her and filmed them having sex, telling her he could sell the movie on the black market. Crown Prosecutor Clayton Wallis said Houdini approached another girl in March 2008 and asked if she wanted to be his personal assistant. She declined, but the girls 15-year-old sister called Houdini. He told her he had a modelling and acting business. He bought her a schoolgirl outfit and took photos of her posing at Lake Moogerah near Ipswich before fondling her. The girl complained to police, who raided his house in June 2008 to find child pornography, mostly of younger children, the pornographic video and images of the first victim and a sex tape of another girl which was made in New South Wales. The girl can be heard telling Houdini she is 15 in the movie. He had also repackaged this into a promotional video on his computer, calling it Houdinis Hot Escorts and named himself as the producer and star. Police tracked down the girl in the video and she said Houdini also took sexualised photos of her at Lake Moogerah after asking if she wanted to do modelling work. The court heard Houdini is likely to be extradited to New South Wales to face further charges. Houdini also took photos of a 14-year-old girl posing in 2006, telling her he could get her modelling work. He also admitted sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl. Dressed in his magicians outfit, Houdini showed her a pornographic movie, kissed her while naked and in front of her mother and that night performed a sexual act over the girl. Judge Deborah Richards told Houdini he made the offers sound glamorous but it was all very seedy. Houdini pleaded guilty to possessing child exploitation material and nine charges of indecent treatment of a child. He had pleaded not guilty to maintaining a sexual relationship with a child and involving a child in making child exploitation material, claiming he did not know she was 15, but was found guilty after a trial earlier this year. He was sentenced to six years jail and will be eligible to apply for parole on March 8 next year with 810 days spent in pre-sentence custody taken into account. Houdini read a statement apologising to his victims and at times choked with tears. Defence barrister Peter Nolan said Houdini found religious solace in jail awaiting sentence. http://www.qt.com.au/story/2010/11/27/magician-court-kids-pedophile-sexual-abuse-jail/ http://www.qt.com.au/story/2010/11/26/houdini-cant-escape-jail-sentence/ Magician Franky Houdini facing 10 years jail for sexually abusing four girls aged between six and 15..6-11-2010. A prominent magician and children's entertainer is facing more than 10 years in jail when he sentenced in Ipswich today for sexually abusing four girls aged between six and 15 and videotaping himself having sex with a would-be teenage assistant. Franky Houdini, a popular Ipswich magician, escapologist and entertainer, is scheduled to appear in the Ipswich District Court this morning for sentence on numerous sexual offences committed in 2007 and 2008. Houdini, 36, whose original name was Frank Kunde, pleaded guilty in April to six counts of indecent treatment of a child - four against a six-year-old girl and two committed on a 15-year-old. He also pleaded guilty to possessing child exploitation material, understood to contain video footage of another 15-year-old girl in stages of undress. The entertainer, who legally changed his name to Franky Houdini several years ago, was also convicted by an Ipswich jury of maintaining a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl and making a pornographic film of himself having sex with her. The jury, which took less than an hour to convict Houdini, heard he told investigators at the time he believed the girl was 16. The court was told Houdini met the girl at North Ipswich's Riverlink Shopping Centre in 2008. He bought her adult toys and exotic attire, and photographed her in provocative poses. The Crown said the performer also took the girl to a hotel and videotaped them having sex, and later told her of his plans to sell the sex tape and share the proceeds. Prosecutors this week told Judge Deborah Richards one of the offences on the six-year-old girl was committed while Houdini was dressed in his magician's attire. Houdini regularly made the headlines in the 1990s and early this decade for a string of daring stunts, including jumping handcuffed, chained and shackled from Indooroopilly Bridge into the Brisbane River in 2001. Police had to intervene to stop him from being lowered into a flooded Bremer River in 1996 after a failed earlier attempt. Houdini, who has been in custody since July 2008, is scheduled to be sentenced by resident Ipswich judge Deborah Richards this morning. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/magician-franky-houdini-facing-10-years-jail-for-sxually-abusing-four-girls-ages-between-six-and-15/story-e6freoof-1225961289122 http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/magician-admits-child-sex-offences-20100428-tqbk.html|/images/frank_houdini_2.jpg

Man jailed for filming kids in camp shower (6-5-2010) A man filmed a young girl and her mother while they used his portable shower during a camping trip, a court has been told. Rodney Paul Howell, 50, created the videos during camping trips to Double Island Point, north of the Sunshine Coast, with the family between 2005 and 2008. Prosecutor David Nardone told the Brisbane District Court today Howell had befriended the family while living near them in Brisbane. He allowed them to use his portable gas shower at the campsite, where he secretly taped the 11-year-old girl and her mother undressing and washing themselves. The court was told he made another video of the girl using the shower the following year when she was around 12 years old. Mr Nardone said Howell's voyeurism was discovered when the girl's stepfather was staying at his home, and discovered a CD containing the footage. The disc also contained a fourth video of two other girls taking a shower during one of the camping trips. Police searched Howell's home and seized 13 discs containing 163 child exploitation images. He was arrested in March last year, and pleaded guilty today to three counts of making child exploitation material, and one each of observations or recordings in breach of privacy and possessing child exploitation material. Judge Brian Devereaux sentenced him to 15 months' jail and ordered Howell be released on probation after serving four months. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/man-jailed-for-filming-kids-in-camp-shower/story-e6freuyi-1225863124999

DAVID ANTHONY HUDSON (NSW- Sydney/ Russell Lea)|41 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to a minimum 5 yrs and 7 months in jail.|David Anthony Hudson- jailed for his role in an international child sex tourism ring and for offences against a Thai teenager. Australians in global child sex ring- (17-3-2011) Seventeen of the 31 Australians involved in a worldwide pedophile ring have already been sentenced to terms ranging from eight years' jail to 150 hours of community service. So far, 184 people have been arrested and 230 children - four of them Australians - rescued from members of the Netherlands-based website Boylover.net. A 25-year-old Sydney man from Eastwood was sentenced to eight years in 2010 on multiple charges including three counts of having sex with a child, while Victorian Bryan Cooper is serving seven years for procuring boys for sex. A judge described Cooper's crimes as "sheer filth" when sentencing him last month. Cooper, 25, from Maryborough, assumed the online alias of a 14-year-old to groom children for sex. Sydney man David Anthony Hudson, 40, from Russell Lea, was jailed for his role in an international child sex tourism ring and is spending a minimum five years and seven months in jail for offences against a Thai teenager. George Iliakis, a former teacher from exclusive Brighton Grammar in Melbourne, sent videos and pictures of young boys to other members of the ring, which at its height had 70,000 members. Iliakis, who is serving a minimum two-year sentence, handcuffed and gagged boys before photographing them for his sexual gratification. Two Melbourne members of the ring were sentenced to 150 hours' community service and a five-month suspended sentence for possessing child pornography. Five more Australians in the ring are before the courts, while three have been charged but are yet to appear. The suspects came from many walks of life, including Scout leaders, lifesavers and teachers, and ranged in age from 19 to 84. The 84-year-old lives in Thailand and has been charged with "contact sex" offences. Melbourne music teacher Philip Alan Reid was jailed in 2008 for two years and three months, with a minimum of 15 months, for possessing child porn. Reid had written notes on grooming children for sex, including one headed: "You don't need to sexually seduce children - if you give them enough time they will seduce you." A federal police spokeswoman told AAP that four of the Australians held high-level positions within the ring. Perth accountant Ralph Ian Assheton, who is believed to be one of the high-ranking members, pleaded guilty last year to using the Internet to access child pornography and was jailed for two-and-a-half years. Police say details of the investigation have been kept secret until now for operational reasons. Operation Rescue began in 2007 and involved police from Australia, the US, New Zealand, Europol, the Netherlands and Canada along with investigators from Britain's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre. "With over 200 children removed from harm globally, we imagine an even larger number of children were safeguarded elsewhere in the world," said Grant Edwards, the manager of investigations at the Canberra-based high-tech crime lab. "We will never know the total figure due to it being such a limitless crime. Global law enforcement is working together internationally to protect children wherever they may be in the world." Commander Edwards said inquiries were continuing, with many suspects still being tracked online and leading police to other websites. More arrests are expected, including in Australia, as investigations continue. http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/australians-in-global-child-sex-ring-20110317-1bxoo.html

"Child sex offender fined for 'forgetting'" (26-1-2012) A convicted child sex offender who failed to comply with the requirements of Victoria's Sex Register claimed he simply forgot, a court has heard. But a police prosecutor told Geelong Magistrates' Court, Walter Hueber would have had his obligations fully explained to him when first placed on it. "Those conditions included having to report any change in personal circumstances, including a change of address, change of motor vehicle and/or phone number, to police within 14 days," Leading Senior Constable David Vanderpol said. Hueber, 59, formerly of Dereel and now living in Geelong, pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates' Court yesterday to four failures to comply with the Sex Offenders Register. Hueber was placed on the register for eight years in 2009 after being convicted of sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl.

ANDREW DAVID HUMPHRIES (QLD - Rockville)|42 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Andrew David Humphries/ possessing child pornography/ contravening an offender prohibition order and giving false or misleading information/ public nuisance offence. Pervert gets prison sentence- (5-2-2011) Convicted pervert Andrew David Humphries had moved in with a family and shared a room with a 13-year-old disabled boy in breach of orders that he have no contact with children under 16, Toowoomba Magistrates Court heard yesterday. Andrew Humphries, 41, had been a reportable offender under the Child Protection Act since his conviction in September last year for possessing child pornography in the form of mobile phone photographs of childrens genitalia depicted in medical books, the court heard. One of a number of restrictions imposed by the court was that Humphries was to have no contact with children under 16 unless under approved supervision, or reside in a house where children under 16 live, or loiter or remain within 200 metres of a school or day-care centre. In December police had been told Humphries had moved into a Rockville home with a family and was sharing a room with a 13-year-old disabled boy. When questioned by police he admitted he had moved into the home for about a week-and-a-half and said he had helped undress the boy for showering as the lad was severely handicapped, prosecutor Sergeant Mark McKenzie told the court. Humphries also admitted he had sexual thoughts about children, but told police he had never touched the child inappropriately, Sgt McKenzie said. Humphries said he had moved into the family home because the only accommodation he had been able to find had been within 200 metres of a school or day-care centre which would be in breach of his five-year order. Humphries pleaded guilty to contravening an offender prohibition order and giving false or misleading information. He also pleaded guilty to an unrelated public nuisance offence arising from his standing naked outside public toilets at the University of Southern Queensland on the afternoon of September 26. Magistrate Bruce Schemioneck sentenced Humphries to 12 months jail, minus the 58 days he had spent in pre-sentence custody, and ordered he be eligible to apply for release on parole from April 8 http://www.thechronicle.com.au/story/2011/02/05/pervert-cops-prison-sentence-toowoomba-andrew/

"Child-sex predator Colin Humphrys begs  please let me go free" (1-3-2014) Notorious child sex predator Colin Humphrys has launched Supreme Court action to be freed from prison. The serial child abductor, who was jailed indefinitely a decade ago, wants to live in the community on licence despite a shocking history of sex offending against young boys that spans 40 years. Humphrys is the third serial paedophile currently before the court seeking freedom. Recidivist offenders Mark Trevor Marshall, 44, and Gavin Shaun Schuster, 37, are both awaiting court decisions to decide their freedom. Marshalls release on licence conditions are still being considered, while a court ruling to free Schuster on licence made last July is the subject of a fresh application by Director of Public Prosecutions Adam Kimber, SC, to be reconsidered. Marshalls application has prompted Attorney-General John Rau to intervene to ensure community safety is considered in any decision made by the court. Opposition legal affairs spokesman Stephen Wade has signalled that stance will not change if a Liberal government is elected on March 15. The move by Humphrys, 63, to be released has sparked concern from Commissioner for Victims Rights Michael OConnell, who has intervened in Marshalls case, asking the court to release Marshalls address if he is freed to enhance public safety. .|/images/colin-humphreys-2.jpg

He worked at various primary schools during his career, including Millbrook, Invermay, Dean and Alfredton. "Teacher jailed for sex crimes" (24-5-2005) A former primary school teacher who used his profession to seduce and molest a 14-year-old boy was jailed for at least 4 1/2 years yesterday. Neville Thomas Hunter did not flinch as he was convicted and sentenced to six years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 4 1/2 years, in the County Court at Ballarat. As he was escorted from the court dock, the 58-year-old did not look to his supporters, which included his sister and a former colleague, but walked slowly behind the court orderly, his head bowed. In sentencing Hunter, who pleaded guilty to four counts of indecent assault, one count of buggery and one count of possessing child pornography, Judge Julie Nicholson said his offending was "predatory", "pre-meditated" and "opportunistic". She described the facts of the case as "most serious, disturbing, sickening and at times horrifying" and said Hunter had robbed the victim of his innocence through an "obvious process of seduction". "He (the victim) has been crushed for life, Mr Hunter, and I'm of the view that that arises from your offending," she said. "You and others in the community need to be made aware that predatory, abusive, wanton and opportunistic abuse of young, immature children will warrant (fitting) punishment by the courts." Outside the court, the victim's wife described Hunter's sentence as "appropriate". She said while the case was sad for all involved, an immediate jail term was necessary. "It was very important to get the message across that you can't do that sort of thing," she said. "It does affect the person literally in every aspect of life, relationship wise and everything . . . and that's going to continue right through his life." The victim did not attend court yesterday. Earlier, the court had heard Hunter first approached the victim in Victoria Park in 1979, telling him he was a school teacher who understood children and their problems. He then lured the 14-year-old boy back to his house in Yew St, Wendouree, where he sexually assaulted him in his bedroom. The court heard the pair later engaged in a sporadic relationship for 15 years, despite the victim marrying and having children. The victim reported Hunter to the police after having an argument with him in May 2001 - the same year Hunter retired. Defence lawyer Graham Keil had told the court Hunter had a 37-year, unblemished teaching record at various primary schools, including Millbrook, Invermay, Dean and Alfredton, and did not have any prior convictions. http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/585191/teacher-jailed-for-sex-crimes/ http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/584579/teacher-admits-sex-crimes/

LINDSAY WILLIAM HUTCHINSON - (Lindsay Hutchinson) ( VIC/ WA/ UK and NZ)|63 yrs old (2013)|To be sentenced on April 5, 2013.|Lindsay William Hutchinson - Child Sex Offences/ Former School Teacher-Hutchinson worked in various schools in Melbourne, the UK, New Zealand and Perth as a teacher from 1974 to 1996-all were boys' schools. Music teacher guilty of raping young teen (14-2-2013) A former Christ Church Grammar School teacher has been found guilty of the repeated sexual abuse of a teenage student more than two decades ago. It took a District Court jury today four hours to convict Lindsay William Hutchinson, 63, of the sexual abuse crimes, including rape, from 1983 to December 1985. Hutchinson, a former music director at the prestigious school, was charged with six counts of carnal knowledge against nature, six charges of indecently dealing with a child, and three charges of unlawful and indecent assaulting a young student at the school between 1983 and 1985. He had initially pleaded guilty to some of the charges, but denied the more serious allegations of rape and oral sex with the teenager, which happened on school camps, on school grounds, in St Georges Cathedral deanery in Perth and Hutchinsons home at the time. During the trial, Hutchinson admitted he sexually abused the victim to gain the experience but repeatedly denied he had intercourse. He told the court his first sexual contact with the victim was at a music rehearsal camp in 1984 when he walked from the cottage he was staying in - with his wife and baby daughter - to the dormitory where the boy was asleep on a bunk bed, where he masturbated him. Hutchinson said he left the room and came back 40 minutes later to do the same, before carrying the boy to a staff bedroom where he again masturbated him before taking him back to his bed in the dormitory. He admitted to also masturbating the boy on the second night of the camp, but denied doing any other sexual acts. When asked by his lawyer Mara Barone why he abused the boy, he said he "found him sexually appealing. The victim told the court last week he did not know how to stop the man's abuse. I didnt know what to do, he said. The victim, flanked by his wife, parents and supporters, was in court to hear the verdict this afternoon. Hutchinson is due to be sentenced on April 5. http://www.news.com.au/national/music-teacher-guilty-of-raping-young-teen/story-fndo4e3y-1226578234953 Lindsay William Hutchinson admits abuse at Christ Church Grammar School (11-12-2013) Former Christ Church music teacher admits molesting multiple young boys because he found them 'appealing' but thought he could keep his urges under control. Lindsay William Hutchinson, 63, is on trial for committing six counts of carnal knowledge against nature, six counts of indecently dealing with a child, and three counts of unlawful and indecent assualt, for the repeated sexual abuse of a young student, between December 1983 and September 1985 in several places including country hotel rooms, a school music camp and a deanery. Mr Hutchinson, who was the music director at Claremont's Christ Church Grammar School and organist at St George's Cathedral in the 1980s, has pleaded guilty to some of the charges, but has denied the more serious allegations, including rape. Other witnesses during the trial have testified about inappropriate sexual touching and behaviour, including having photographs taken of them by Mr Hutchinson for a fake "speedo competition", but the allegations do not form part of the charges Mr Hutchinson is facing. As the first defence witness in the District Court trial, the former teacher was called to give evidence this afternoon. Mr Hutchinson told the jury he had worked in various schools in Melbourne, the UK, New Zealand and Perth as a teacher from 1974 to 1996, and all were boys' schools. He took up a post as music director at Christ Church Grammar School in 1981, and in the several years that followed, was the conductor of the CCGS choir, the St George's Cathedral choir and created another choir, the Ad Hoc Chorale. Mr Hutchinson told the court that during the first night of a music rehearsal camp in 1984, he went into the victim's dormitory and masturbated him under his pyjamas while standing next to the bunk bed. He said he left the room and came back about 40 minutes later to do the same. Mr Hutchinson said he then carried the boy up to a staff bedroom and put him on a bed and masturbated the boy again, before carrying him back to his bunk bed. "He seemed to be asleep," he said. When defence lawyer Mara Barone put forward allegations of various other sexual acts committed, Mr Hutchinson denied them. When Ms Barone asked Mr Hutchinson why he touched the boy, he replied: "I found him sexually appealing". He admitted to masturbating the boy again the second night of the camp, but denied doing any other sexual acts. Mr Hutchinson also admitted to touching the victim and another young boy during a sleepover at the St George's deanery. He also said it was correct that the victim stayed over one night at his home, while his wife and child were there, but denied anything happened that night. During a trip to a country town, Mr Hutchinson said he also touched the victim when he thought he was asleep. He admitted to touching the victim and simulating sex with him during a choir trip to York in the mid-1980s. "I just wanted to experiment with the sensation," he told the court. Allegations of various sexual acts with his victims were put to Mr Hutchinson in the witness stand, but he denied all of them, saying he had masturbated the boys and simulated sex with one, but nothing more. Ms Barone put allegations to Mr Hutchinson from a victim from the late-1970s who also claimed he was touched and was photographed in swimwear for a fake photo competition. "That's correct," Mr Hutchinson told the court. "He was a keen sportsman, he had a good physique. I was attracted to him." He said he made up the story about a photo competition to lend the activity some "credibility", and also took photos of a couple of other boys. He also admitted to touching a boy on the inner thigh during a trip to Tasmania and touching a youth's genitals on several occasions while driving him in his car. Under cross-examination from prosecutor David Davidson, the former teacher said he first realised he was sexually attracted to young boys in the early 1970s at the first school he taught. He agreed masturbating a child was inappropriate, but said he did not seek help because he thought his urges were controllable. The cross-examination of Mr Hutchinson will continue before Judge Patrick O'Neal tomorrow. As reported in The Sunday Times, a former Christ Church Grammar School student last week told the court he had been sexually abused by Mr Hutchinson and had told the school's chaplain and director of ethics Frank Sheehan. The former student alleged Canon Sheehan told him to "forget about it and put it behind me and ... that I need to get on with my life". Mr Sheehan is expected to be called as a defence witness later this week. http://www.news.com.au/national/lindsay-william-hutchinson-admits-abuse-at-christ-church-grammar-school/story-fndo4e3y-1226575725351
DAVID HUTCHISON (QLD)|68 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in the Maryborough District Court in June 2012 to 7 yrs jail - parole eligibility 3-1-2014.|David Hutchison- pleaded guilty to 7 charges. News (16-6-2012)- "Rapist gets seven years" A man who repeatedly raped a friend received a seven-year sentence yesterday for his crimes - a year for each of the charges to which he pleaded guilty. David Hutchison, 68, said he did not remember anything from the night of January 2 this year after a drinking binge, but his victim will remember it for the rest of her life. Maryborough District Court heard Hutchison showed up drunk, following eight hours of drinking whisky, to the house of a long-time friend. She let him inside and the nightmare began. Over the following two hours, Hutchison orally and digitally raped the woman and threatened her with violence if she did not comply with sick, demeaning acts. "He wasn't going to leave until she did what he wanted," said Crown prosecutor Clayton Wallis. Mr Wallis said the woman's rejection of Hutchison's sexual advances meant nothing to the offender. "I'm going to have you no matter what," were his words on the night, Mr Wallis said. "It was serious sexual offending punctuated by violence and threats." The next day, the victim went straight to the police, who soon apprehended Hutchison along with collecting DNA evidence. Defence barrister James Benjamin said his client "cannot comprehend why he did this". Hutchison "couldn't remember a thing...but never disputed what the claimant said," Mr Benjamin said. He said his client was truly remorseful, and had intended to plead guilty from the moment he was charged, in spite of having no memory of the incident. He said Hutchison wanted to apologise to the woman. Judge Hugh Botting said the sentence of seven years was chosen "to reflect the enormity of the offence". To reflect Hutchison's co-operation with the course of justice and the remorse he showed, however, Judge Botting fixed a parole eligibility date of January 3. 2014. Judge Botting said the breach of trust was an important element of the case after the victim welcomed Hutchison into her home. A heavy-set man with short grey hair, Hutchison sat still and silent throughout his sentencing. Mr Benjamin told the court Hutchison was also undergoing medical testing for a suspected case of prostate cancer. http://www.frasercoastchronicle.com.au/news/rapist-gets-seven-years-for-seven-charges/1419628/
JEFFREY HUTSON (VIC- Wangaratta)|48 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced to 21 months jail - 9 months non parole..Registered sex offender for life|Jeffrey Hutson- 3 counts of indecent assault on a child under 16..Hutson sexually abused an 11 yr old girl. News- Judge Harbison warned Hutson that, on release, he must adhere to any reporting conditions required in being a registered sex offender for life. Hutson  a short, stout man with collar-length black hair and a grey beard  again did not react to his sentence..read more below- Treatment of 11yo girl shameful (7-2-2013) A man who sexually abused an 11-year-old was slammed yesterday for his shameful treatment of the girl. County Court judge Marilyn Harbison said Jeffrey Hutsons actions against a young, defenceless victim meant the only option was to jail him. Judge Harbison also criticised the girls father for allowing her to be left alone with Hutson in his Wangaratta home. Her fathers failure to provide supervision of his child gave you the opportunity to abuse her, she told Hutson in Wodonga yesterday. The court was told Hutson continued to board with and have the support of the girls father. Hutson showed no emotion when sentenced yesterday to 21 months behind bars. Hutson sexually abused the girl after climbing on top of her on three occasions at her fathers Wangaratta house two years ago. Hutson was clothed each time he pulled down her underwear and started rubbing his body against hers. Hutson, now 48, was 46 at the time of the offences. A jury convicted Hutson of three counts of indecent assault on a child under 16. He was found not guilty of five other charges involving allegations of sexual penetration. Hutson will be eligible for parole after just nine months. Judge Harbison said she had set a shorter than usual non-parole period to ensure a start was made as early as possible to rehabilitate Hutson. But Hutsons failure to show remorse might still put parole out of reach  a requirement of jail parole programs is admitting offences. The girl moved to her fathers home in early 2011 from Queensland where she had lived with her mother. Judge Harbison said she was willing to accept Hutsons offending was at the lower end of the sexual offences scale, describing the acts as spur of the moment. I accept there is no evidence she was crying or upset after the offending, she said. Judge Harbison warned Hutson that, on release, he must adhere to any reporting conditions required in being a registered sex offender for life. Hutson  a short, stout man with collar-length black hair and a grey beard  again did not react to his sentence. Judge Harbison made note of the victim impact statements from the girl and her mother. Specifically, she referred to the youngsters comments that she was now clingy with her mother and no longer liked to be hugged or kissed. Hutson was described as someone of low intelligence  but not intellectually disabled  although he clearly understood it was wrong to sexually abuse a child. http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1284811/treatment-of-11yo-girl-shameful/?cs=11

News (31-3-2011)- A Melbourne man will reappear in court for sentencing on May 18 after pleading guilty to three offences following an incident with a police officer on Wednesday. Paul Incani, 43, appeared in Wangaratta Magistrates Court yesterday after being arrested following an incident in which a Wangaratta highway patrol officer was dragged by a car for a short distance. The officer had intercepted Incani near Porepunkah for a traffic offence about 2.30pm. It was discovered he had an outstanding warrant in the Northern Territory and the officer reached in to turn off the vehicles ignition. But Incani drove off with the officer suffering minor injuries. Police later arrested Incani on the Selwyn Creek Track in the Buckland Valley about 40 kilometres south of Porepunkah at 5.30pm. Incani pleaded guilty to charges of escaping from police custody, resisting arrest and recklessly causing injury. The case was heard by magistrate John Murphy through a video link to Shepparton. Incani was bailed to reappear for sentencing.  http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/57935/police-drag-racer-guilty/   No more jail for sex act teacher- (31-10-2008)  A teacher who indecently dealt with a Northern Territory student will not serve any more time behind bars after winning an appeal for a fully-suspended sentence.  http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/10/31/13015_ntnews.html   Sex attack teacher gets 3 months jail,but walks free on bail-(12-7-2008)  A family friend of a teenage student indecently assaulted by her teacher called out "not enough" as the man was jailed for three months yesterday. And 40 minutes later the 40-year-old teacher was bailed by Darwin's Chief Magistrate after he lodged an appeal against the sentence to be heard in the Supreme Court. Melbourne-based teacher Paul Incani, who pleaded guilty to indecently dealing with the teenage Darwin student, proceeded to "dry hump" the girl at a popular picnic spot, indecently touch her and make her lie semi-naked on his back. Magistrate Greg Cavanaghwho adjourned the matter overnight to consider the teacher's fatesaid he was "satisfied" he had breached his special relationship with his student, given the teacher had disguised the girl in sunglasses and a hat for a secret liaison at Lake Alexander last year and sent her intimate text messages. "This was a planned and sustained seduction by a mature adult of a young lady," Mr Cavanagh said. "It was not something that was on the spur of the moment ... (and) not something that was incidental to an innocent arrangement. "To suggest otherwise is fanciful." He said the man's crimes were serious as they were not "just a passing caress". And the teacher's "great affection" for his student had destroyed his teaching career, with his name to be placed on the national sex offenders register. "I've got no doubt that (he) knew he was doing the wrong thing but couldn't resist the temptation," he said. He said the teacher's actions had an "ongoing impact" on the girl, who yesterday publicly spoke of her despair and spiral into self-harm. Mr Cavanagh said the teacher's behaviour should be "denounced" as "outrageous". "He was entrusted with the tutoring by the young lady's parents at home. He's betrayed their trust and the community's trust," he said. He sentenced the teacher to 15 months jail, suspended after three months. The maximum penalty is eight years jail. As Incani was led out of court, a family friend said "have a nice time". But his lawyer Peter Elliott lodged an immediate appeal, and chief magistrate Jenny Blokland granted him bail on strict conditions to return to Melbourne with his father. Incani showed no emotion nor made any comment as he left court. He is expected to appear in the Supreme Court later this year. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/07/12/4651_ntnews.html Sex act teacher ruined my life http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/07/11/4637_ntnews.html

News (11-3-2011)- "Man posed as nurse to rape teen" David Irelandes fraudulently claimed to be a nurse and he unlawfully carried out intimate internal examinations on a heavily pregnant 17-year-old girl in the week before she gave birth. The teenager, who still suffers emotional harm, later described how she felt violated, was sick and gutted when she learnt that Irelandes was a fraud. Posing as a nurse allowed Irelandes to win the trust of the teenager, her boyfriend and family members. He did not commit the offences for sexual gratification because he is openly homosexual and it remains a mystery why he did it. It (internal examinations) caused the girl a lot of pain and the threat of injury to her and her unborn child was very real, Crown prosecutor Chris Winlaw said. The Crown says he got some gratification from being closely involved in her pregnancy and his desire to deliver the baby. "His conduct was reckless, dangerous and selfish and he did it at great risk to the girl and her unborn child. Irelandes, 21, right, pleaded guilty in the District Court in Mackay yesterday to six offences of rape in November 2009.

Sentencing was handed down to Joseph Jack of Hope Vale at the Cairns District Court yesterday. Jack was 20 when he violently attacked the women who were walking alone in the early hours of November 8 and November 18, 2010. "He went to trial last week and he was found guilty of all charges," said Detective Sergeant and Officer In Charge at Mossman CIB, Trevor. These charges were Common Assault for which he was given an 18 month sentence, Assault Occasioning Bodily Harm (2 years 6 months), Rape (10 years), and stealing from the person (6 months). These terms are to be served concurrently and no minimum sentence was handed down. "It was really good to get him off the streets," Detective Sergeant Perham said. "He escalated his violence from the first attack to the second. "He was in his infancy in committing these offences but he very quickly escalated his degree of violence." Detective Sergeant Perham said Jack preyed on women walking alone after leaving local night spots, and urged others to take heed of the warnings. "I can't warn people strongly enough about not doing stuff like that. It's a safe place, but we're not immune," he said. http://www.tourismportdouglas.com.au/Rapist-given-10-year-sentence.7738.0.html

News (22-6-2009)- "Army recruit spat on girl after filming rape" A Brisbane army recruit filmed himself raping a 16-year-old girl and later spat on her while she lay unconscious on a bathroom floor, a court has heard. Brisbane man Timothy Alexander Jack, 21, will spend the next six months behind bars after he pleaded guilty today in the Brisbane District Court to one charge of rape and one charge of sexual assault. The court was told Jack, then 19, was at a house party on New Year's Eve 2006 when he asked a 16-year-old for sex and she refused, telling him she "wasn't like that." Some time later she passed out after drinking ten to 12 tequila shots and while she was unconscious, Jack raped her while using a mobile phone to film the act. Later the girl woke up and he helped her while she vomited in the toilet. She passed out again on the bathroom floor and another person filmed Jack spitting on her body. Days later the girl found out through friends what Jack had done and heard that he had been "laughing about it" with friends whom he showed the footage. She then made a complaint to police, who questioned him about the incident and found the footage on his phone. Defence barrister Paul Smith said his client had had a relationship with his victim in the past but said his behaviour at the party was out of character. He said at the time of the offence, Jack, a former student of St Laurence's Catholic College in Brisbane, had began training with the Australian Army. He had hoped to serve Australia in Afghanistan but could not do so as he was on leave awaiting sentencing, Mr Smith said. Judge Leanne Clare SC said Jack had taken advantage of the girl. "You filmed yourself violating her body," she told him. "You used her for your sexual pleasure, you treated her with contempt." She sentenced him to two years' jail, to be suspended after he serves six months. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/army-recruit-spat-on-girl-after-filming-rape-court-20090622-ct6l.html#ixzz24RVVSHOr

Pleaded guilty 4-3-2011, in the Sydney District Court,to sexually assaulting 4 boys between 1977 and 1983, when he was an Anglican Church youth group leader in the 1980s. Jacobs was a CEBS leader at Christ Church, St Ives, and St Swithuns, in Pymble, St Ives, from 1971 to 1981. In 1982 he moved to CEBS at St Swithuns in Pymble but left in 1984. News (4-3-2011)- "Sexual abuse victims tell of despair, anger and death wish"- Four victims who were serially sexually abused as 10- and 11-year-old boys by a church youth group leader told a Sydney court today how he had ruined their lives. One victim said he had attempted suicide at the age of 14 and had struggled all his life to contain a "simmering anger" that lay below the surface. Another said he had attempted suicide twice and had been admitted to hospital five times with severe depression. A third, now aged 42, whose mother read out his statement to the court, said he had struggled with the effects of the abuse for 30 years. "I felt betrayed by a young man I trusted and by an Anglican Church I respected," he said. Today, in the District Court, Sydney management consultant Simon Antony Jacobs, 58, of North Sydney, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the four as boys between 1977 and 1983 when he was an Anglican Church youth group leader in the 1980s. Jacobs pleaded guilty in December to raping and indecently assaulting two other boys who were in his care while he was a leader in the Church of England Anglican Boys Society, or CEBS. Those charges - one count of buggery and three counts of committing an indecent act - related to offences he committed while he supervised the boys. Michael Farrar, barrister for the accused, said his client had led a "blameless life" since the offences were committed "some 30 odd years ago". Jacobs went on to enjoy a long career in management consultancy, working most recently for Forum Asia Pacific in its Sydney office. He was taken into custody today ahead of sentencing on March 23. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sexual-abuse-victims-tell-of-despair-anger-and-death-wish-20110304-1bhdi.html#ixzz1wEdenwWC News (6-12-2010)- A former Anglican Church youth group leader who repeatedly raped a boy, 11, over a two-year period told his victim the assaults were okay because they were not against God's word. Simon Antony Jacobs, 58, from North Sydney, has pleaded guilty to four charges against two boys while he was a leader in the Church of England Boys Society, or CEBS, at two churches on the north shore during the 1970s and 1980s. The charges - one count of buggery and three counts of committing an indecent act - relate to offences committed while he supervised the boys, who were both 11, as a CEBS leader at Christ Church, St Ives, and St Swithuns, in Pymble. Jacobs is also accused of molesting another two boys, both 10, during the same period. The District Court was told on Friday that Jacobs - now a management consultant - raped one of the boys, Victim A, at least twice a month from the beginning of 1978 to the end of 1980 in the downstairs bedroom of Jacobs's parents' home in St Ives. At one point Victim A challenged Jacobs, who was then 25, about what he was doing. "In his Bible studies [the victim] had read that a man and another man should not have sex together," the court heard. "Jacobs told him that it was permissible as they were not making babies." The court was told that Jacobs went to extraordinary lengths to groom his victims, telling them they were special and even shaving Victim A's genitals and legs when he showed signs of puberty. Jacobs also befriended the boys' parents, hosted sleepovers, babysat the boys and their siblings, showered them with gifts, took Victim A to the rugby league at Brookvale Oval and bought ugg boots for Victim B. "[Victim B] and his parents grew to know, like and to trust Jacobs," the court heard. ''Jacobs regularly told the victim that he was a special person and singled him out to do special things from time to time. He also generally paid more attention to him than to the other boys." Jacobs also took nude photographs of both boys, comprising "close-ups and full body shots", the court heard. One photographic session took place when Jacobs took Victim A bushwalking behind Acron Oval, St Ives. Victim B was assaulted while at a CEBS beach camp in 1983. Jacobs forced the boy to share a tent with him and assaulted him. A spokesman for the Anglican Church said Jacobs had worked as a CEBS leader at Christ Church, St Ives, "in various roles" from 1971 to 1981. In 1982 he moved to CEBS at St Swithuns in Pymble but left in 1984. "The record is unclear, but at some point, possibly after leaving Pymble, a note was made that he was not to be issued with a leaders warrant, which he would have required in order to move to leadership in any CEBS group in another parish,'' the spokesman said. Jacobs is due to be sentenced in the District Court on March 4. http://www.smh.com.au/national/church-youth-group-leader-repeatedly-raped-boy-11-20101205-18lep.html|/images/Simon_Jacobs_2.jpg

During his sentencing remarks, Judge John Robertson said even though there were no victims who testified in court, the offence was still "evil". "The films you viewed are of actual children who are abused in some part of the world, sometimes unfortunately even Australia," he said. Judge Robertson said the court had heard that two of the videos showed children crying and resisting, while a third involved a bondage scenario. He said the children involved in the videos were aged between 7 and 15. - Bus driver jailed for child porn (13-9-2011) A school bus driver found with 11 child pornography videos has been jailed for 12 months. Raymond Donald Jay, 36, formerly of Anderson St, Avenell Heights, was yesterday convicted by a jury of eight women and four men after a three-day trial in Bundaberg District Court. It took the jury less than a day to return the guilty verdict. The court was told during the trial that the videos had been found by police on a USB stick in a safe in August 2009, and that only Jay knew the combination of the safe. His de facto partner held the only other key, which had gone missing from her key ring. During his sentencing remarks, Judge John Robertson said even though there were no victims who testified in court, the offence was still "evil". "The films you viewed are of actual children who are abused in some part of the world, sometimes unfortunately even Australia," he said. Judge Robertson said the court had heard that two of the videos showed children crying and resisting, while a third involved a bondage scenario. He said the children involved in the videos were aged between 7 and 15. "These are truly appalling activities, which seem to be on the increase," he said. The judge said it had not been disputed that the videos were described as category four child pornography material, on a scale of one to five with five as the worst. Judge Robertson said Jay had shown a lack of remorse when he instructed his barrister to put to his step-daughter the scenario that she had downloaded the videos in order to frame him - a claim the judge said he thought lacked evidence. In sentencing, he said he took into account Jay's previously unblemished record and the fact he would no longer be able to work with children. Defence barrister John McInnes said Jay had suffered public humiliation after media reports of the court case. "Because of his position as a school bus driver, he had a number of people call asking if he was the person involved," he said. Mr McInnes said Jay had also lost his job as a school bus driver. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/man-36-sent-to-jail-for-child-porn-videos/1100658/

"Convicted rapist could be headed for Coffs on release" (28-3-2013) A sadistic rapist who preyed on elderly women is expected to apply for permission to return to the Mid North Coast following his release from a Queensland jail today. At 45-years of age, the longest period Troy Jerome has spent as a free man is two years. A Brisbane court heard Jerome began offending in the Taree/Coffs Harbour area at a "very young age". After being sentenced for a series of offences including assault and maliciously setting fire to a building with intent to injure, Jerome escaped custody and received another six months to his sentence in the Coffs Harbour District Court. In 1993 he was sentenced in a Brisbane court for attacking a 72-year-old woman in her flat. The court heard that one night, when Jerome was 29, a victim who was known to him, arrived home to find him standing in her bedroom naked, with an erect penis. When she told him to go and "have a sleep" Jerome reappeared in her lounge room wearing socks on his hands. He locked the front door, grabbed the victim, put his fingers inside her mouth "when she tried to scream" and dragged her to a bedroom where he removed the light bulb and attempted to rape her. When she went to the kitchen to "get a glass of water" the victim attempted to grab a knife but Jerome "threw her to the kitchen floor, took her to the bedroom and forced her to engage in oral sex". Eventually the woman began haemorrhaging, told him she was going to be sick and that if he put the light back on she would co-operate. When he walked away she ran to a neighbour for help. While on parole for those offences Jerome was arrested for the rape of another elderly woman. The court heard that on that occasion he had been fighting with his wife and had become "so aggressive that his wife called police who escorted her from the house". Later that day, he went to the home of a 65-year-old Aboriginal woman, who had been diagnosed with mild dementia. With socks on his hands once again and "a towel to ejaculate into", Jerome turned off the power board, removed most of his clothes and entered the home through a bathroom window. He startled the victim in her bed "covered her mouth to stop her from screaming", raped her, used the towel and fled. He was charged with break and enter, two counts of aggravated assault and rape and in 1997 received a 14 year jail sentence. During his time in custody he was charged with the assault of four fellow inmates and making threats against staff. Five breaches are recorded on his custodial file. One psychologist report tabled in court describes Jerome's childhood as being "characterised by exposure to violence and being a victim of sexual abuse". Another report warns it is "unclear" to what extent Jerome would co-operate with a supervision order in the community as he "would prefer to be moving to New South Wales" to live near his (family) and that there may be a "certain degree of rebelliousness in regard to (an order) that kept him in Queensland". APN Newsdesk understands the family members referred to in the report, still reside on the Coffs Harbour region. Justice J Daubney imposed 34 parole conditions on Jerome which include not leaving Queensland without the permission of a corrective services officer, attending counselling and submitting to random drug and alcohol tests. The supervision order will remain in place for five years. http://www.centraltelegraph.com.au/news/convicted-rapist-could-be-headed-coffs-release/1810457/

News (30-4-2008)- "145,000 Images found on computer" A serial pedophile who avoided a rehabilitation course in jail is back behind bars after being caught with a huge collection of child pornography images. Ian Mitchell Johnston was yesterday sentenced in the Brisbane District Court to 42 months jail after nearly 145,000 depraved images were found on his computer. The largest collection ever found on an individual in Queensland, it included sex acts involving children as young as two and explicit photographs he took of two Ipswich sisters, aged seven and nine. Yesterdays sentence follows his imprisonment for 12 months in 2001 for the attempted carnal knowledge of a 12-year-old intellectually disabled girl he was babysitting in 2004. The 48-year-old also received the then-maximum two years for possessing more than 11,000 child pornography images. In urging a jail term of four to five years, Crown prosecutor Vicki Loury yesterday said the extraordinarily large number of images held by Johnston was more than any other person who has been sentenced so far, and the greater number by manyfold. The highest sentence previously imposed for possessing child-sex images in Queensland was 18 months, suspended after three months, in 2006 for a man found with 17,000 less serious images. The court heard Johnston began to download the images soon after his release from jail in January 2006 and had amassed nearly 140,000 still photographs and 156 videos by the time he was arrested in September that year. Ms Loury told the court Johnston had been in jail for two years but he did not undertake the sexual offenders treatment program as the waiting list was too long. Defence barrister Joe Briggs told Judge David Andrews that his client was aware he needed to address his problems and wished to on his last occasion in prison. But he was advised he wasnt eligible to do the course because there was not sufficient time to complete it, Mr Briggs said. Johnstons actions, while deplored by the community, were not near the worst of the kind and he should be jailed only for three years, he said. Johnston, who lives with his parents, told police after his arrest that he would rather look than touch and hurt anyone. Johnston pleaded guilty to charges of possessing and distributing child exploitation material and and two counts of indecent treatment of a child for photographing the two Ipswich sisters. Judge Andrews said although Johnston was caught red-handed with the images and the camera that was used to photograph the sisters, he had taken into account his early plea of guilty and level of co-operation with authorities in determining his sentence. He also ordered that Johnston serve all of the three months of a suspended sentence he received in 2004 for failing to comply with reporting conditions. http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23619525-3102,00.html  News (15-7-2004)- "Man jailed in global crackdown on child pornography" http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/442096

GARY MICHAEL JOHNSTONE (Gary Johnstone) ( SA- Allendale East , near Mt Gambier)|54 yrs old (2013)|To be sentenced in April- 2013.|Gary Michael Johnstone- Pleaded guilty to 4 counts of downloading and sharing child pornography as well as engaging in sexually explicit online chats with a person he believed was an 11 yr old girl. Jail looms after Allendale East man's child pornography quest (4-2-2013) A South-East man intercepted by the FBI encouraging overseas people to film their children in sexual acts should prepare for a prison sentence, a District Court judge has warned. Gary Michael Johnstone, 54, pleaded guilty to four counts of downloading and sharing child pornography as well as engaging in sexually explicit online chats with a person he believed was an 11-year-old girl. Judge Paul Cuthbertson said Johnstone, of Allendale East near Mt Gambier, appeared to have been part of an online child pornography ring involving overseas paedophiles. The court heard Johnstone actively encouraged child pornography to be produced during conversations with overseas people, including a Polish mother who offered to provide him with sexually explicit images of her young daughter. "(Johnstone) is actively contemplating that there is some poor little kid somewhere in the world subjected to, over a period of time - and he's encouraging it - sexual abuse," he said. "He says in a number of (emails) that he would love to see pics and in another he says `have you found someone to have sex with (a young girl) yet?'." Commonwealth prosecutor Tim Griffin said Johnstone had numerous discussions with people about making their children available to perform sexual acts and offered to masturbate with the intention of it being shown to children. Mr Griffin said police had also found lengthy chatlogs of conversations Johnstone had in November 2010 with a Sydney online user who claimed to be an 11-year-old girl. Unlike many prosecutions, the "girl" was not an undercover police officer and authorities had been unable to find out if the online user was in fact a child or a person impersonating the girl, the court heard. Prosecutors said some of the videos and images fell into the worst category of child pornography, which includes acts of sadism and bestiality. Mr Griffin urged Judge Cuthbertson to impose a substantial prison term to send a message that the community would not tolerate those who helped spread the "social evil" of child pornography. "Parents need to be ever so diligent in monitoring the whereabouts of their children in an online environment ... but with the massive amounts of emails, smartphones and computers, they can't constantly monitor where their children are online and whether they are safe," Mr Griffin said. Australian Federal Police arrested Johnstone at his home after they were tipped off by the American FBI, who arrested one of his online contacts. His lawyer, John Dillon, said Johnstone made full and frank admissions to police, was deeply remorseful for his crimes and had sought counselling and treatment. Mr Dillon said Johnstone had worked his entire life at a Mt Gambier car dealership and had started downloading child pornography after becoming depressed when his mother died in 2000. He asked Judge Cuthbertson to suspend any prison term, arguing that jailing Johnstone would "do more harm than good". Judge Cuthbertson remanded Johnstone on continuing bail for sentencing in April and warned him to get his affairs in order in anticipation of a likely prison term. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/jail-looms-after-allendale-east-mans-child-pornography-quest/story-e6frea83-1226570041826|/images/gary_michael_johnstone_2.jpg

MURRAY WENDELL JONES (NSW- Griffith , near Sydney)|47 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Murray Wendell Jones - Former Griffith High sports master - Pleaded guilty to installing a device and filming for an indecent purpose. News- "Spy's time in jail is cut" Disgraced former Griffith High sports master Murray Jones has had his sentence cut in half after a psychological report indicated glandular fever and work stress contributed to his crime. Dubbed the bathroom spy, Jones fronted the District Court in Griffith on Wednesday, calling for a reduction to the six months periodic detention he received after pleading guilty to installing a device and filming for an indecent purpose. Pointing to a detailed psychological report, his barrister Irving Wallach argued mental health issues had led him to make a monumental error of judgment in setting up a hidden pot plant camera in his bathroom to record a teenager who was living with him at the time. Mr Wallach argued the original sentence had been excessive and called for a good behaviour bond or suspended sentence in its place. However Judge Payne instead chose to reduce the penalty to three months. There were strong mental health issues and this was an absolutely out of character personal judgment, Mr Wallach said. What he did was so far out of his normal character it was extraordinary. The defence counsel also spoke of the penalties Jones had received outside the court, in particular the loss of his 20-year teaching career and widespread public humiliation. Ultimately hes having to move town  to live in Sydney. Hes realised he cant stay in a small town like Griffith, he said. This is a personal tragedy for him. He also said Jones had not housed the young victim in order to prey on him but rather was acting altruistically in assisting the family. Theres no suggestion Mr Jones was a predator  he played an ill advised role in supporting this family, he said. Acting on behalf of the Crown, Gabrielle Steedman said Jones had breached the victims trust. This was a father and son type relationship  and the victim was particularly vulnerable, Ms Steedman said. He held a high moral position and a position of trust. Judge Payne indicated she found the psychological report difficult to swallow. Why would stress lead you to access child pornography?, Judge Payne said. I find it difficult to see the connection between being under stress and engaging in this kind of behaviour. She also expressed shock the teacher was living with the young man and said the community needed to be protected from such behaviour. It beggars belief he would put himself in this situation  he should have known this was a recipe for disaster, she said. This is a very sad case for him. Jones was suspended from Griffith High without pay since he was charged in January and was terminated on March 9 when he pleaded guilty to the offences. He has been placed on a never to be employed again list at the Department of Education and the national child protection register. http://www.riverinamediagroup.com.au/Home/common/printNews.asp?publication=The+Area+News&ArticleID=19982 News (14-3-2007)- "Teacher faces lifetime ban over toilet camera" A Griffith High School teacher in southern New South Wales will never be allowed to teach again after pleading guilty to charges related to a teenage boy finding a hidden camera in his home.

Appealed his sentence, and was released after serving less than 2 mths jail.|Ricky Carl Jones - Former Ipswich football coach- Pleaded guilty to using a carriage service to download child exploitation material and 2 counts of possessing child exploitation material. Much of the material was in category four  the second-worst category  and depicted children as young as 6 yrs old. News (4-6-2011)- "Courts release shamed coach" An Ipswich football coach jailed for possessing child pornography has been released after successfully appealing his sentence. Ricky Carl Jones was ordered to spend three months out of a 15 month sentence behind bars after admitting downloading child pornography. But he was released yesterday after spending less than two months in jail. Police found 44 images and seven videos of child exploitation material in Jones Barellan Point home. Much of the material was in category four  the second-worst category  and depicted children as young as six in sexual acts. On April 8 Ipswich District Court Judge Gregory Koppenol sentenced Jones to 15 months jail, to be released after three months on a $2000 good behaviour bond, for using a carriage service to download the material. He also received a 12-month concurrent jail sentence for two offences of possessing child exploitation material. Jones, 47, pleaded guilty to all three charges. But his lawyers appealed the sentence, arguing Jones had suffered public shaming by appearing in The Queensland Times newspaper over his offences and should not spend any time in jail. Commonwealth prosecutors agreed a 15-month jail sentence with immediate release was appropriate. Defence barrister Steve Kissick said he could not object to media coverage of the case but public shaming was a relevant consideration. Because of my clients position at the time  a coach in local football  he did receive significant shaming, Mr Kissick said. But Judge Koppenol argued the media had a right to report on the case. Theres nothing wrong with that in my opinion, Judge Koppenol said at the time. The media has a right and should be encouraged. Judge Koppenol said courts should take a tough stand against people who accessed and possessed child pornography as it was not a victimless crime. Mr Kissick applied for Supreme Court bail for his client shortly after the sentence but it was refused and Jones remained in jail pending the result yesterday. The Supreme Court of Appeal increased Jones sentence to two years for using a carriage service but ordered he be released from jail immediately. The 12 month sentence was not changed on appeal. The court heard Jones had turned to the internet and pornography when his second marriage broke down and he was depressed. After being charged in 2009 Jones was stood down from the Norths Rugby League Club, where he had coached adult players as well as juniors since 1994. http://www.qt.com.au/news/courts-release-shamed-coach-sentence-increased-but/868708/ http://www.qt.com.au/news/footy-coach-child-porn-trial/538571/ http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/footy-coach-faces-child-porn-charge-20090814-ek5f.html|/images/ricky_carl_jones_2.jpg

He said: A term of imprisonment is required in this case. Jones lawyer, Tim Walsh, told the court his client had himself been abused as a young child. His intention was to revisit some of that behaviour and establish his mastery over it, Mr Walsh said. Mr Keil adjourned the court briefly to read some of the material found on the school laptop, and then described it as confronting and repellent. He said the thought of a primary teacher reading a story about the rape of an eight-year-old was very worrying. Jones will appear again for sentencing on August 4. http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23763171-2862,00.html|/images/tyrone_jones_1.jpg
RICHARD JONGSMA  (VIC- North Blackburn)  |50 yrs old|Sentenced in September 2003 to 8 yrs jail/ 6 yrs non parole. |17 charges- including two counts of causing a child to take part in an act of prostitution/ 7 counts of performing an indecent act on a child under 16 yrs/ counts of making/ possessing child pornography. Victims were 4 girls (aged between 14-16 yrs old). Police found an extensive collection of child pornography (images/ footage). Sentenced as a "Serious Sexual Offender". News (27-9-2003)- "Jail for pedophile who bribed girls" A man who used cigarettes and cash to entice sexual favours from four schoolgirls was yesterday jailed for at least six years. Richard Jongsma, 41, paid hundreds of dollars to the girls, aged between 14 and 16, and took them shopping at a suburban mall, buying shoes and underwear. In exchange, County Court Judge Tom Neesham said, Jongsma received sexual favours in his car, at a local park and at home. He also convinced two of the girls to pose for pornographic photographs. It is clear that you satisfied your undoubted perversion by paying them to accommodate you, Judge Neesham said. Jongsma, of Primula Street, Blackburn North, was sentenced to eight years in prison with a minimum term of six years. Earlier this month he pleaded guilty to 17 charges including seven counts of performing an indecent act on a child under the age of 16, two counts of causing a child to take part in an act of prostitution and counts of making and possessing child pornography. The offences were committed between July 2001 and September 2002. Jongsma met the first girl through an internet chat room when she was 14. The other victims were her sister, aged 16, and two schoolfriends, both 14. Police arrested Jongsma in September 2002 following an anonymous tip-off. A search of his home revealed an extensive collection of downloaded child pornography, including images and footage Judge Neesham described as monstrous. A report from forensic psychologist Jeffrey Cummins tendered during the plea hearing suggested Jongsma was not a pedophile and was not likely to reoffend. But Judge Neesham said Jongsma had lied during his psychiatric interview and that he could not accept the report. He said he did not believe Jongsma was remorseful and said the community needed to be protected from him. Jongsma was sentenced as a serious sexual offender. http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/26/1064083191156.html?from=storyrhs Man 'bought' sex favours from schoolgirls, court told" A 41-year-old man used cigarettes and cash to entice sexual favours from four schoolgirls, aged between 14 and 16, a court heard yesterday. The County Court was told that Richard Jongsma, 41, of Primula Street, Blackburn North, befriended the first girl, aged 14, through an internet chat group. It was told that he paid her to pose for pornographic photographs and provide sexual favours in his car, at his home and in a local park. Jongsma pleaded guilty to 17 charges including seven counts of performing an indecent act on a child under the age of 16, two counts of causing a child to take part in prostitution and two counts of producing child pornography. The offences were committed between July 2001 and September 2002. Prosecutor Mark Gamble said Jongsma had met the first girl in the chat group, where he was known by the nickname alcoholic beverage. The other victims were the girls 16-year-old sister and two friends, both aged 14. On one occasion, the court was told, Jongsma telephoned the first girls school claiming to be her father and arranged to collect her for a few hours. He then drove her to his home where he took photographs of her, paying her $200. On another occasion, Mr Gamble said, Jongsma took two of the girls on a shopping spree, buying them clothes, underwear and electrical goods worth $500 in exchange for sexual acts. Jongsma was arrested in September 2002 after an anonymous tip-off. Police found pornographic photographs of two of the girls as well as downloaded internet child pornography on his home computer. A report tendered to the court from forensic psychologist Jeffrey Cummins suggested Jongsma was not sexually attracted to young girls. But after viewing the downloaded images  many featuring prepubescent girls  Judge Neesham said he had little doubt that Jongsma was a predatory pedophile. They demonstrate without a doubt that your client has an unhealthy interest in children, he said. Defence barrister Russell Sarah said Jongsma had been opportunistic rather than predatory and had been motivated by loneliness. Mr Sarah said many of the sexual episodes had been initiated by the girls, who he said, saw Jongsma as a soft touch they could obtain money from. The hearing continues. http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/18/1063625159592.html?from=storyrhs
STEPHEN MICHAEL JONSSON (Stephen Jonsson) (WA- Perth)|48 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced Nov 2012, in the Perth Supreme Court, to an indefinite custody order.. In February 2011 he was jailed for 14 months for lurking near a train station and detaining an eight-year-old girl in a men's toilet with intent to cause her detriment.. sentenced to supervision orders in 2007 and 2008 for offences including two of indecent dealing with young girls.|Stephen Michael Jonsson - Repeat Offender/ Declared a dangerous sex offender - "Jail 'only place' for disabled sex fiend" (21-11-2012) A 48-year-old intellectually disabled man who has been declared a dangerous sex offender faces a "life sentence" because no government department will take responsibility for his difficult case, a Supreme Court judge has warned. In a decision on Monday, Justice John McKechnie said he had no choice but to make an indefinite custody order for Stephen Michael Jonsson to ensure adequate community protection. Jonsson has an overall IQ of 66 and has been a client of disability services agencies since he was three. He was physically abused by his father and had early behavioural problems. He was put in an institution at 10 and stayed there for 19 years. Jonsson was sentenced to supervision orders in 2007 and 2008 for offences including two of indecent dealing with young girls. In February 2011 he was jailed for 14 months for lurking near a train station and detaining an eight-year-old girl in a men's toilet with intent to cause her detriment. He was assessed in jail as suitable for sex offender treatment for people with intellectual disabilities but the course was cancelled. His lawyer accepted he was a serious community danger with the options being community supervision or continuing detention. Evidence was given that if released, Jonsson would need 24-hour supervision at a cost of at least $250,000 a year. Justice McKechnie said neither the Disability Services Commission nor Department of Corrective Services would fund the supervision. Only a non-government agency would make a proposal. Corrective Services Commissioner Ian Johnson said he understood the supervision required for Jonsson would cost more than $1 million a year. "If a person is of such a risk that they require full-time supervision, then the only place we can do this is in a prison," he said. Disability Services Commission director-general Ron Chalmers said the agency would fund Jonsson's disability-related needs if he was released but could not provide "security-related services". http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/15431539/jail-only-place-for-disabled-sex-fiend/ http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/10878520/disabled-sex-offender-could-face-indefinite-jail/

At the time Kajer was arrested he was a ‘Residential Care Supervisor’for people with disabilities of all ages including children/ was alsoin charge of kids wards at the ‘Victorian Mental Health Authority’. 11images of naked children were discovered on Kajers computer. He was in the process of deleting the images when police raided his home in Nov 2004.  News (9-2-2005)- "Worker at DHS had porn" A department of Human Services worker yesterday avoided jail over child pornography charges  but he will not work with children again. Janek Felix Kajer, 55, was banned from working at the DHS after being convicted and put on the sexual offenders register. But Kajer wont have to spend a day behind bars after a magistrate suspended a six-month jail term for two years. Broadmeadows Magistrates Court heard 11 images of pre-pubescent children posing naked were discovered on Kajers computer. The court was told Kajer, of Barkly St, Sunbury, was trying to delete the images when police raided his premises in November last year. Police also found an unregistered air rifle in a bungalow cupboard. Police prosecutor Sen-Constable Ron Lennox said Kajer denied he had any child pornography, claiming the images were of adolescents. Kajer yesterday pleaded guilty to three charges, including one count of possessing child pornography and possessing an unregistered firearm. When arrested Kajer was a residential care supervisor and carer of disabled people of all ages, including children. During his 30 years with DHS Kajer was in charge of childrens wards at the Victorian Mental Health Authority, later called Caloola Training Centre. His solicitor, Michael Kuzilny, said Kajer was so ashamed that he resigned from the department. Mr Kuzilny said Kajer, who has an 11-year-old daughter, was reclusive and his computer was his window to the world. Magistrate James Mornane also imposed a community based order, which requires Kajer to undergo an intense sexual offenders program. A DHS spokesman last night said that under safety screening policy, Kajers conviction meant he could not be employed by the DHS.

The 47-year-old Mt Waverley man will serve a 12-month intensive corrections order and has to pay $1700 in compensation. Police prosecutor Leading Sen-Constable Adrian Hale said while Karklins was working in performance arts at Monash University he benefited by organising products to be bought from his own theatrical supplies company. When police executed a search warrant on his home in October last year, they found the illegal images on a laptop computer. He made admissions to knowingly viewing child pornography, Sen-Constable Hale said. They were 11 and 12 year-old girls; there were videos, a story and pictures. He said were there for personal gratification. Defence solicitor Andrew De Kretser said there were no excuses for Karklins conduct, but he didnt deliberately seek out the pornographic material. There was alcohol consumption at the time of offending (and) he has shown real remorse from the outset, he said. Magistrate Thomas Barrett convicted Karklins, and ordered him to serve an intensive corrections order for a year. It means he must do unpaid community work, adhere to a curfew and report to police. He also has to repay the university. http://bayside-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/police-find-porn/

The woman denied contact with Brother Anthony Peter Whelan, the principal of St Patrick's College, Sutherland, in 1978 after her son, then 13, told Brother Whelan he was sexually assaulted by a teacher, Thomas Keady. The woman disputed assertions by the Christian Brothers last week that Brother Whelan had talked with parents about the Keady allegations, saying ''we had no liaison with him whatsoever''.http://www.smh.com.au/national/mother-of-abuse-victim-calls-for-inquiry-into-church-20120708-21pl5.html Church shuttered inquiry into abuse- (6-7-2012) THE church prematurely terminated an investigation last year into the alleged failure of a top Catholic education official to take action over the sexual assault of an 11-year-old boy in the 1970s by a lay teacher. A former principal of St Patrick's at Sutherland, Brother Anthony Peter Whelan, had been accused .. http://www.smh.com.au/national/church-shuttered-inquiry-into-abuse-20120705-21k8c.html http://www.tor.id.au/article.php/2011061000491053 News (28-4-2012)- In June 2010, a Port Stephens businessman pulled his car off the road near Stockton bridge, stepped out, and vomited. He had just reported for the first time being sexually assaulted at the age of 11. The setting was a NSW Catholic school in 1976. His abuser was a paedophile teacher the school had employed after his release from a Victorian jail in the mid 1960s. For the businessman, who asked to be called John, it was the first day in a long and painful journey. In a submission to the Victorian parliamentary inquiry announced last week into child sex abuse in religious institutions, he will demonstrate why calls are increasing for a national inquiry into sexual abuse of children within churches. Back on that day in June 2010, he named the paedophile teacher Thomas Keady, and two Christian Brothers to whom he allegedly reported the abuse as a child. He vomited at Stockton while recalling the ugly sexual assaults and Keady's threats that he would "kill me if I screamed". John cried on Wednesday as he recalled reading an independent report for the Christian Brothers in February this year that substantiated John was forcibly sexually assaulted by Keady and had been telling the truth. The report also substantiated his allegation that the abuse was reported to a teacher and Christian Brother at the school between 1976 and 1978. Police are investigating his allegation that he told another Christian Brother at the school, who allegedly told him he was lying. That person went on to hold a senior position in Catholic education until his retirement. The Catholic church accepted Thomas Keady was a sexual predator of children, and John was sexually and indecently assaulted by him at the school, and at a camping trip. "I cried when I read the report. To see it substantiated has allowed me the confidence to say I told the truth. The little boy was actually right," John said. Keady taught in Victorian schools in the 1950s until he was convicted of child sex offences and jailed in the early 1960s. He was employed by the NSW Catholic high school south of Sydney in 1966, and taught there until he was dismissed in October 1979. The dismissal followed complaints from four boys who said they were molested by him on a trip. Police were not notified of the allegations. A Christian brother in 2010 told an investigator he "requested each student to inform his parents of the matter", as it was the parents' right to inform police. He said Keady was advised he could "quietly return on the school weekend to remove his personal effects and surrender his school keys, which he did". Keady was provided with a statement of his service that made no mention of his dismissal, or the reasons for it. He was convicted of further child sex offences at Wyong Local Court in 1994. A police investigation of Keady, 84, ended in late 2010 after police determined he was "not in a mental state" to respond to charges. In his submission to the Victorian inquiry, John will outline his contact with others who were molested by Keady. "A commission, a national inquiry, is obviously needed because there's nothing new about my experiences with the church. But there are now more people willing to expose the truth," John said. 'I cried when I read the report. To see it substantiated has allowed me the confidence to say I told the truth. The little boy was actually right.'

Charged as part of Taskforce Argos a Queensland Police investigation targeting the illegal accessing and downloading of child pornography. "Men walk free over child porn charges" (11-12-2010) A Townsville man who distributed a graphic tutorial over the internet describing how to sexually abuse young children will walk free in just three months after being sentenced yesterday. Timothy Hinspeter, 36, pleaded guilty to one count of distributing and three counts of possessing child exploitation material. On November 18, 2007, police discovered Hinspeter was circulating an explicit pictorial tutorial via a peer-to-peer file sharing site. The four-minute guide detailed how to sexually assault girls from infancy through to 13 years of age. Explicit instructions about different objects that could be used while performing illegal acts were provided. It also specified ideal times to carry out such offences to ensure a spouse would not discover what was going on. The file displayed 39 images of young girls. Hinspeter was arrested on March 5, 2008, after a raid at his home. In addition to the tutorial, police seized his laptop and numerous hard drives, which contained 42 child porn videos, some as long as 45 minutes. They depicted as many as three young children being molested by men. In handing down his sentence, Judge John Baulch SC told Hinspeter: "There is no indication the nature of the offence shocked you or caused you to reconsider or stop what you were doing." Hinspeter was given 18 months' jail for the distribution charge, to be wholly suspended after just three months. He will then be subject to two years' probation. Meanwhile, two other Townsville men also charged as part of Taskforce Argos a Queensland Police investigation targeting the illegal accessing and downloading of child pornography have pleaded guilty and walked from court. Ashley Kenneth Kearns, 48, and Peter Andrew Morgan, 42, both appeared this week in the Townsville District Court. Judge John Baulch SC said the pair, who were regular visitors to pornographic websites that offer illicit images and videos of underage children, was involved in a "disgusting trade". Kearns, an ex-employee of Ergon Energy, faced 22 charges. He also appeared on 21 commonwealth charges of using a carriage service, namely the internet, to download child pornography material. He was given two wholly suspended sentences 18 months in jail for the Commonwealth offences and ordered to pay $2000 recognisance, while he was given six months' imprisonment for the state charge. Morgan, a fitter and turner, was charged with two state counts of possessing child exploitation material . He was given a nine-month jail sentence wholly suspended. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/12/11/191771_news.html

DANIEL PAUL KEELEY (Daniel Keeley) (NSW - Nelson Bay)|31 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in 2012, to a total of 15 yrs in jail, with a non-parole period of 12 yrs.|Daniel Paul Keeley - Rapist - Keeley pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent occasioning actual bodily harm and one count of aggravated robbery..Labelled the Cooks Hills rapist by the media "Cooks Hill rapist jailed - Attack brutal, callous and degrading: Judge" (1-9-2012) The Cooks Hills rapist will spend between 12 and 15 years in jail for a premeditated, brutal and callous attack on a 23-year-old stranger in the night. Daniel Paul Keeley, 31, called out to the lone female as she made her way home on foot after work about 8.30pm on a Monday in July last year. A flat car tyre had left her without her usual means of transport. Ironically, she had asked her work colleagues about the safest way home. After jogging up to her, Keeley grabbed the womans wallet and stepped away, but then he stepped back. Just take it, she told him, but he moved in behind her. She started dialling triple-0 when he threatened her, and she realised he was holding a knife to her throat. In the laneway between the Lowlands Bowling Club and nearby houses, she tried to reason with him, offering him her keycard, but he repeatedly threatened to stab her and told her to shut up. He forced her to the ground, and ignored her objections. He raped her repeatedly while continuing to threaten her with the knife, cutting her hand in the process. When his phone rang for the second time he stopped to answer it, then said something like thank you miss, picked up the wallet and ran off. The details emerged during sentencing in Newcastle District Court yesterday, when Judge Laura Wells, SC, described the ordeal as nothing short of completely terrifying. No doubt there would have been times, if not the whole time, where she thought she was going to die, Judge Wells said. Perhaps after the first rape, the slightly built woman thought her ordeal was over, the judge said. But it seems the ordeal was only half over, she said. The attack was brutal, callous, humiliating and degrading, and carried out in an efficient and forceful manner, with an element of premeditation, Judge Wells said. In an attempt to avoid arrest, Keeley shaved off his full-face beard and got a new drivers licence in his mothers maiden name. Keeley pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent occasioning actual bodily harm and one count of aggravated robbery. He was sentenced to a total of 15 years in jail, with a non-parole period of 12 years. Senior officers hunch pays off Detective Senior Constable Jason Freney knew the pressure was building. It was 11 days after the city had woken to news of one of the worst attacks on a woman in the regions history  a knife-wielding attacker who randomly selected a young woman walking home and viciously raped her in a laneway near Lowlands Bowling Club, Cooks Hill. The fabric of the city had changed. They needed to catch this vicious rapist quickly. Strike Force Scotswood had sent evidence from the victim to forensic specialists with an urgent sticker to extract DNA from it as soon as possible. The attack occurred on July 11 last year and on the afternoon the DNA result comes back, on July 22, police get their first big lead. The DNA taken from the semen sample matches DNA profiles from a burglary on a unit on Fowler Street, Hamilton South, in 2008 and the break-ins of two cars in Nelson Bay the year before. But they have already charged the bloke responsible for the Fowler Street job. His DNA isnt the rapists. Freney has a hunch. The burglary victim was named as a Daniel Paul Keeley. Freney lucks out when checking for Keeleys DNA profile on the database. It could mean the semen could be his. Keeley has some form and there is evidence he frequently visited relatives at Nelson Bay in 2006, at the time of the car break-ins. Freney is onto something. But more checks are needed. In her statement, the victim says she hears her attackers phone ringing during the attack. They think the attack was between 8.20pm and 8.50pm. Keeleys phone records show there were two missed calls from his partner at 8.24pm and 8.40pm. But the cops still dont have enough to arrest him. They check his licence. Five days later Keeley tells the then RTA in Newcastle West he has lost his licence. His old licence had a photograph of him with a beard similar to the one described by the victim. This time he is clean shaven and has had his hair cut off. He obtains a new licence under the name Daniel Paul Marriott. The police have enough to obtain Keeleys DNA profile and get it tested. By this time, Freney has put out an alert on Keeley and his New Zealand passport. On July 31, Freney gets a call from immigration officials at Sydneys international airport - Keeley is boarding a plane to Bali in an hour with his family. By August 4, the DNA sample is returned and its a match from the semen sample. Keeley is the rapist. As Keeley walks towards customs on his return, Freney grabs him. Once he discovers they have his DNA, Keeley admits his guilt. His partner gives police a statement detailing a history of domestic violence, and how Keeley arrived home on the night of the attack about 9pm and said he found $20 and a packet of cigarettes in a park. She reveals that the day after the attack, and after they see a news report on it, Keeley jokes that the description of the attacker sounds like him. Within days she disowns him. More than 12 months after his arrest, Keeleys Holden Commodore remains parked outside his unit block. It is filled to the brim with his rotting belongings. http://www.theherald.com.au/story/291761/cooks-hill-rapist-jailed/
ROBERT WILLIAM KEELING (NSW- Cringila)|41 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced December 2011, to 6 months jail. Sentenced 2007 to 3 yrs jail- 18 months non parole|Robert Keeling/ Paedophile- sent inappropriate texts to a 13-year-old girl. In 2007 Keeling was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, three counts of aggravated indecent assault and stalking an 11-year-old girl. News (5-12-2011)- A SEX offender who sent inappropriate texts to a 13-year-old girl has been jailed for six months. The sentence given to Robert William Keeling, 41, of Jarvie Road, Cringilla in Nowra Local Court also covered his failure to inform police of several changes of address. In 2007 Keeling was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, three counts of aggravated indecent assault and stalking an 11-year-old girl. He was given a three-year sentence with a non-parole period of 18 months and placed on the child protection register, one of its requirements being that he inform police if he moved. Keeling was living at Seven Hills until December last year and visiting Nowra where his girlfriend lived. Through her he met his young victim and socialised with her parents. On September 17 last year he saw her at Wollongong Railway Station on a school excursion. He asked for her mobile number and then sent her a text inviting her over for a drink. Later that evening he was at her place with her family and his girlfriend when he sent texts saying she was hot asking her to get drunk with him. The girl felt uncomfortable, and went to hide in her room. She told her parents who informed the police. On December 11 last year police went to Keelings Seven Hills address on an unrelated matter to discover he had moved.

SIMON ANDREW KEMP (Simon Kemp) (QLD- Sunshine coast)|31 yrs old |Sentenced in the Maroochydoore District Court to 15 months jail - Suspended after serving 4 months.|Simon Andrew Kemp - Former Sunshine Coast high school teacher..5 counts of possessing child pornography-was found in possession of 14,231 still and 542 video pornographic images of children aged 1-14 yrs. Fears paedophile may teach again (3-4-2010) A convicted child-porn paedophile  a former Sunshine Coast high school teacher  may be back in the classroom within three years. Simon Andrew Kemp, who taught at Maroochydore High, was found in possession of 14,000 child pornography pictures and more than 500 child-porn video files. Mr Kemp served four months in prison in 2008 over the child exploitation material featuring children aged between one and 15. He is one of a potentially large group of offenders who can use a loophole in the Queensland Education Act. If Mr Kemp had kept his Queensland teacher registration up to date, he would never again be able to teach in Queensland. However, he let the registration lapse. Anyone wanting to teach in this state has to be registered by the Queensland College of Teachers. Because he was not registered, the QCT disciplinary committee could meter out one penalty only. That was to prohibit Mr Kemp from re-applying for his teacher registration for five years. Neither the government nor the QCT is willing to accept responsibility for the loophole. Last month, Opposition education spokesman Bruce Flegg said he wanted a life ban slapped on any teacher found guilty of criminal offences against children. In cases such as child rape and the very serious end of allegations, we should be ensuring these people never again deal with children, he said. This constant reapplying to go back into teaching, we run the risk that some of these people are just going to slip through the net and back into the classroom. Mr Kemp was a registered Queensland teacher for four years before he was picked up by a Queensland police taskforce targeting child abusers. He was teaching maths and information technology at Maroochydore High at the time and had coached an under 15 boys soccer team. In June, 2007, Taskforce Argos informed QCT that Mr Kemp had been charged with offences of possession of child exploitation material and making child exploitation material. The Daily has obtained a copy of the QCT Teachers' Disciplinary Committee hearing documents, available under the Right to Information Act. It revealed that Crown prosecution submissions to Maroochydore District Court included that Mr Kemp had images and videos of children, aged one to 14, posing naked and engaging in oral, anal and vaginal sex with each other and adult males. Mr Kemp was sentenced to 15 months in jail, suspended after serving four months. QCT director John Ryan told the Daily this week it had never received an application from a former teacher whose registration they had cancelled. Mr Ryan, who denied there was a loophole, said the applicant would have to prove he or she had extenuating circumstances to be able to teach again. Queensland Education Minister Geoff Wilson was unavailable for comment yesterday. Twenty-six teacher registrations were cancelled last year and another 300 remained under investigation. Most can reapply for registration after five years. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/fears-that-child-porn-paedophile-may-teach-again-l/501690/ http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/teacher-jailed-possessing-child-pron-simon-kemp/344424/

MARK KENNEDY (QLD)| |Sentenced in the Brisbane District Court, to 22 yrs in jail.|Rapist. News (25-9-2006)- "Rapist at work in community"- A SERIAL rapist and a pedophile are among four sex offenders allowed back into the community on work release at least seven times despite a ban imposed in June. The ban has since been reinforced by prison chief Frank Rockett after The Courier-Mail photographed Palen Creek prisoners  including Mark Kennedy, a serial rapist serving 22 years  working at the Beaudesert Showgrounds on August 28. In sentencing Kennedy, District Court Judge Tony Healy said the attacks had featured "revolting cruelty and violence". He is among the prisoners doing community service at showgrounds, church yards and memorial grounds in the Beaudesert and Boonah areas  often near schools. Prison guards say only one officer supervises as many as five inmates over large, open areas, often at distances of more than 500m and out of sight for up to 10 minutes. The prisoners on work leave-of-absences (LOAs) are considered low-security and are serving sentences for rape, armed robbery, sodomy, murder, traffic offences and assault. In June a three-year program in which sex offenders were among a group of inmates doing ground maintenance at the Star Gardens Nursing Home at Beaudesert ended because of officers' concerns about inadequate supervision. "Many of the residents at Star Gardens lay in their beds unsupervised quite visible from the outside with only a screen door as a divide," an officer wrote in April. The officer also raised concerns that sex offenders on work release at a Rathdowney church were close to a primary school. "I am unsure if everyone approving these LOAs knows of its proximity to Rathdowney school and wonder if they did would it be approved?" he wrote. In June, Palen Creek management reduced the number of inmates sent to the home to three and Mr Rockett issued a directive that no sex offenders be allowed work release. But documents show nothing was changed in relation to sex offenders working at churches, showgrounds and memorial grounds at Beaudesert, Rathdowney and Boonah. When The Courier-Mail asked Corrective Services whether sex offenders were still working at showgrounds and near schools, the department denied it. A spokesman said community service projects were conducted under strict guidelines and supervision. Queensland Prison Officers Association state secretary Brian Newman said members believed the LOAs arrangements and "dangerous" staffing levels were putting public safety at risk. "One unarmed prison officer cannot effectively monitor the movements of sex offenders or any prisoner on an external escort, this is especially alarming where it concerns the safety of our children innocently enjoying a day at school," he said. Mr Newman said if a prison officer went on a toilet break there "instantly" was a situation where prisoners were left unsupervised. "This situation regularly occurs and is being managed through good luck rather than good governance," he said. Officers said while there had been no offences committed by sex offenders or other inmates on the LOAs, it was important that "temptation was not put in their way". "It doesn't matter that these prisoners are low-security, they have committed very serious crimes and no one can predict what a guy who has been serving 19 years for rape is going to do if a woman or an elderly patient is around," an officer said. The Opposition called for an investigation into the allegations saying there was a "culture of cover-ups" permeating through the state's public service to protect the Government. Opposition Leader Jeff Seeney said it was important for the rehabilitation of sex offenders that they be allowed out on work release, but only after a risk assessment and under supervision. Other sex offenders in the program are: Thomas Richard Tiltman , 39 (who is serving 17 years for sodomy); Anthony John Davis , 45 (14 years for indecent dealing) and Shane Patrick Trunks , 36 (16 years for rape and attempted murder). http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/rapist-at-work-in-community/story-e6freoof-1111112260854

Brenton Robert Kenward, 29, was sentenced last week to nine months' prison to be suspended after one month. He pleaded guilty in the NT Supreme Court to three counts of possessing child abuse material - ranging up to the worst possible category - after his McMinns Lagoon bedroom was searched by police in July and September last year. Justice Judith Kelly said during sentencing that police found a laptop in his bedroom that had 1932 images in its deleted items folder on July 20, 2010. She said three of those images were category 5 - or sexual activity between adults and children with a "cruelty or torture" component. But she said most of the images were category 1 with no sexual activity. Justice Kelly said two memory cards - containing 1497 images and 61 videos - were found when police searched Kenward's bedroom for a second time in September 2010. She said the memory cards were found inside old phones that Kenward bought from Cash Converters. "You simply found the material on memory cards you acquired for another purpose," she said. She said Kenward had two prior convictions for indecent dealings with children under 16 years that would suggest he had "a sexual interest in children". Kenward was convicted and placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2011/11/24/274321_ntnews.html

Walter Kerr, 57, of Church St, Manifold Heights, had pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates Court to possessing 28 images of child pornography. The images he possessed were said by Magistrate Ron Saines to include the rape of pubescent and pre-pubescent females. Kerr told an earlier hearing he downloaded the child pornography for excitement. In a separate hearing Mark Anderson, 37, of Beacon Point Rd, Clifton Springs, pleaded guilty to a single count of possessing 60 images of child pornography. The court heard Anderson paid for the child pornography over the internet before local police were alerted to his activities by Federal Police. Mr Saines said the images collected by Anderson were of very young pre-pubescent females engaged in sexual acts with adult males . The clear distress of some of the victims is indicative of a serious case of child pornography, he said. Police prosecutor Leading Senior Constable Geoff Lamb called for jail sentences in both cases, while lawyers for Kerr and Anderson argued against it.

MOHAMMAD SEHNAWAZ KHAN (VIC - Springvale)|31yrs old (2007)|Sentenced in November 2007 to 2yrs jail.|Pleaded guilty - 3 counts of committing an indecent act with a child under 16 yrs. Victim was a 9yr old girl. "Man jailed over shopping mall sex attack" (22-11-2007) A 31-year-old man illegally staying in Australia has been jailed for two years over the sexual assault of a nine-year-old girl in the change room of a Melbourne shopping centre. The Victorian County Court heard that Mohammad Sehnawaz Khan, of Springvale, approached the nine-year-old girl and her eight-year-old sister at the Chadstone Shopping Centre on March 14, this year. The girls were in the toy section of a department store when Khan pressured the nine-year-old to go into a change room and try on a dress that he said he wanted to buy for his niece in India. He assaulted her in the change room while her sister was present, the court heard. Khan, who came to Australia on a student visa in 2001, will be deported at the end of his jail sentence, the court heard. He illegally obtained a new visa by giving a false name and date of birth when he returned to Australia after visiting his ill father in India, the court heard. Judge Michael Higgins sentenced Khan - who earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of committing an indecent act with a child under 16 years - to two years' jail. Judge Higgins said Khan was entitled to a substantial reduction in his sentence after he pleaded guilty, saving the sisters the significant trauma of having to give evidence at a trial. The judge said Khan's victim and her sister now felt fearful in public places, were frightened to be alone, feared Khan would come to their house looking for them and suffered nightmares. Video surveillance footage showing Khan in the shopping centre prompted someone to contact police and identify him when it was played on Crime Stoppers, the court heard. Outside court, Detective Acting Sergeant Jason Lebusque said Crime Stoppers played a vital role in bringing Khan to justice. "If it wasn't for Crime Stoppers we may not have solved this investigation, he said. "And we thank the community for their help in arresting Khan on this occasion." .

Khan was jailed in 2004 for a minimum four years and two months for raping a female passer-by on a footpath at Thornbury in Melbourne's north while cars drove past. He was released in September 2007 on parole, which finished in June 2009. Judge Pullen had "guarded optimism" for Khan's rehabilitation prospects and jailed him for four years, with a minimum of two years and five months. He has been in custody since the latest offences and will become eligible for parole in about seven months. He had pleaded guilty to intentionally causing serious injury. http://corpau.blogspot.com.au/2011/09/convicted-rapist-jailed-again-for.html News (9-6-2004)- "Teenage rapist jailed 6 years"- A teenager who raped a woman on a footpath as cars drove past was jailed yesterday for almost six years for what a judge described as one of "the worst examples of predatory behaviour" he had dealt with.

Khan grabbed the woman, put his hand over her mouth and told her he had a knife before raping her on the footpath. Judge David Morrow said people driving past in cars saw parts of the incident, but did not intervene. The judge said the attack was not premeditated, but was extremely serious and predatory behaviour. He said Khan's actions constituted a woman's "worst nightmare". The court was told the victim suffered various injuries, including swelling, bruising and aggravation of the spinal nerve. She has also been treated for post-traumatic stress disorder.

Mr Howard submitted to Judge Nicholson that a fully suspended jail term should be imposed. The court heard King lived with his parents in Brisbane and worked at a supermarket. He was granted bail. His pre-sentence hearing continues on Tuesday. http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/08/16/1029114013140.html
RONALD DEAN KING  (NSW- Maclean)|24 yrs old |Sentenced in the District court/ Feb 2009 to a 2 yr suspended sentence..very lenient sentence/ released back into the community.|Paedophile. King entered a South Grafton home and sexually assaulted a 4 yr old girl. News- "Child sex offender should get 20 years says MP"- A MACLEAN man convicted of having sex with a child should spend at least 20 years in jail says Clarence MP Steve Cansdell. Mr Cansdell was yesterday scathing of a sentence imposed by the District Court last month that allowed the sex offender to be released back into the community. Ronald Dean King spent 14 months in custody while awaiting sentence on a charge of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10. The 24-year-old admitted entering a house in South Grafton while intoxicated and sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl. The Daily Examiner revealed on Saturday that King received a two year suspended jail sentence, meaning he will only go to prison if he commits further offences in the next two years. Mr Cansdell said he was shocked at the leniency of the sentence, yesterday contacting NSW shadow Attorney General Greg Smith for a crisis meeting. He said Mr Smith agreed the opposition would pressure the Department of Public Prosecutions to appeal the sentence. The courts have once again proved they are completely out of touch with the community, Mr Cansdell said. Crimes against children, particularly those of a sexual nature, deserve the harshest possible punishment. This monster should be locked up in jail and get the punishment he deserves and what the community expects. Mr Cansdell said the case showed the need for lengthy mandatory minimum sentences for child sex offenders.- http://www.dailyexaminer.com.au/story/2009/03/03/20-years-jail-for-child-sex-offender-says-mp/
TREVOR WAYNE KING (VIC- Mildura)|50 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 1-6-2012, in the Mildura County Court, to 3.5 yrs jail - 2 yrs and 3 months non parole.|Trevor King - Found guilty 8 counts of performing an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 (Victim was a teenage boy). Repeat Offender. 18 prior convictions, including 8 for indecent assault,and 10 for gross indecency. Victims were 2 boys aged between seven and 10 yrs. News (2-6-2012)- "Man, 50, jailed: Businessman guilty of indecent acts"- A Mildura businessman who was this week found guilty on eight counts of performing an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 has been jailed for 3 years. County Court Judge Tim Wood said the offending by Trevor Wayne King was a carefully orchestrated plan to entrap the victim in order to gratify the accuseds deviant desires. King, 50, had pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of performing an indecent act with a child under 16 and was acquitted on four counts by direction of the judge. However, the jury found him guilty on the remaining eight counts and Judge Wood ordered him to serve at least two years and three months in jail before being eligible for parole. At his plea hearing in the County Court sitting at Mildura yesterday, Crown prosecutor David ODoherty said King had shown absolutely no remorse, concocted an allegation of motive for the victims accusations and his defence relied on accusing the victim of inventing a deliberate conspiracy or calculated lie. Mr ODoherty said the planned and calculated grooming of the boy would have continued had the boy not brought an end to the offending. The court was told King had 18 prior convictions  including eight for indecent assault and 10 for gross indecency  committed against two brothers aged between seven and 10. Those offences took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s and King subsequently received a suspended term of imprisonment in 1997 after pleading guilty. Mr ODoherty said the more recent offending was a serious example of indecent conduct that had demonstrated a gross breach of trust. Defence counsel Florian Andrighetto said the prosecutions emphasis on Kings prior offending was disturbing because he was a very young man at the time and the matters were not dealt with by the courts until many years later. Mr Andrighetto said that while Kings more recent offending was a serious crime, the reality is that it is at the very low end of the scale. This offending involved no touching, he said. http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/man-50-jailed-businessman-guilty-of-indecent-acts/2577268.aspx

News (15-6-2012)- "Sydney bus driver who perved on schoolgirls, jailed" A bus driver who installed a spy camera to film up the skirts of hundreds of schoolgirls will spend at least nine months in jail. Sentencing Takuya Koaze, 48, in the Downing Centre Local Court today, Magistrate Michael Price said he had filmed "many unwitting victims" after he bought a spy camera in Japan and installed it on a Sydney Transport bus. "An aggravating factor clearly has to be (the victims') vulnerability by virtue of their age," Mr Price said, adding it was not an impulsive or isolated event. "This is a serious pattern of criminal behaviour, more particularly because it was planned." Koaze had pleaded guilty to three counts of filming people's private parts to obtain sexual arousal, while working as a bus driver. Police found more than 2500 images and over 60 minutes of footage of girls, some of whom appeared to be as young as 10 or 11. The images focused on the victims' legs, buttocks and genital area. Earlier Koaze told the court he had made a "terrible mistake" and he apologised to his victims. Koaze's mother told the court she continues to support her son and their relationship has grown stronger since the charges were laid. "After this incidence he began to realise that is not a preferable hobby," Setsoko Koaze said. Ms Koaze added that her son had turned to religion and was going to marry. Mr Price said it was clear Koaze, who the court heard has a high IQ, suffered from "some social discomfort". "It's apparent to the court that you regret your actions," he said. He sentenced Koaze to one year's imprisonment with a non-probation period of nine months. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/sydney-bus-driver-filmed-up-skirts-jailed/story-e6freooo-1226396998126|/images/takuya_koaze_2.jpg

Victim was an 8 yr old boy. News (7-8-2011)- "Victim captures sex fiend's confession online" Fourteen years after molesting a child, a sex fiend has been brought to justice after being caught out by his victim in an online chatroom. Jason Raymond Koschel abused an eight-year-old boy four times in 1997, but he lied to police and the charges were dropped. However, Koschel and his victim met again by chance. By then, the victim was an adult and Koschel confessed his crimes. The victim, then 19, managed to get Koschel to repeat the admission online and recorded the conversation. He then went to police with the same allegations he had made as an eight-year-old. Officers were able to use the recording as evidence to prosecute the man they previously let walk free. This week in the Melbourne County Court, Koschel, 40, of Wodonga, was sentenced to a minimum 3 1/2 years in prison. He pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent acts and one count of sexual penetration. He admitted forcing the boy to kiss him and touch his penis in incidents that took place over eight months. The victim, now 22, said he still finds it difficult to keep friends, needs counselling and has disturbing flashbacks to his childhood. "As a young child, someone saying you're wrong or lying was something I really didn't understand," he said. Judge Mark Gamble said the 1997 crimes had a "profound and lasting effect" but he would reduce the sentence because Koschel had spared the victim the ordeal of a trial by pleading guilty. Koschel received a total sentence of 5 1/2 years with a non-parole period of 3 1/2 years. He was deemed as having a "moderate" chance of being rehabilitated. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/sex-fiend-caught-in-a-net-trap/story-fn7x8me2-1226109930485

Kramer was reportedly spirited to Israel in 1992 by the college, before moving to the US a decade later, where he was convicted of sexually abusing a 12-year-old boy in Missouri and sentenced to seven years in jail at the Missouri Department of Corrections. He was paroled in April after serving four years of his sentence and arrested immediately by US Marshals on his release because of the extradition request by the Australian government. A spokesperson for the Attorney-Generals Department told The AJN that Kramer was wanted by Victorian authorities to face prosecution for the offences of indecent assault and indecent acts with a child under the age of 16 and that Mr Kramer was arrested in the United States on 23 April 2012 in response to Australias request for his extradition. The alleged assaults were committed against four boys at Yeshivah College between 1989 and 1992. Kramer is currently on remand in a St Louis jail and has applied for bail. He will likely face court in August for the beginning of extradition proceedings. A lawyer for Kramer, Matthew Chase, said his client denies the charges and will argue the veracity of the claims made against the 51-year-old, given more than 20 years have passed since the alleged abuses took place. Theres no option but to fight it [the charges]. He denies the wrongdoing vehemently, Chase told The AJN. Its tough [because] hes now a convicted felon. Its frustrating for me to have a client who is facing charges that could have been brought at any time in the last 20 years and chose not to. Its 20 years-plus old complaints. Complaints which were made at the time and for 20 years Australia very easily could have found out where he was. Its not like hes been a fugitive hiding from justice, nor was he a person who fled Australia. Chase said one of the alleged victims has accused Kramer of hundreds of separate instances of abuse, a claim he describes as outlandish. They have a lot of statements  Theres no physical evidence. They have nothing and its 20 years old. Victim advocate Manny Waks, who has publicly claimed he was sexually assaulted at Yeshivah College, said it is common for accusations of abuse to surface years after the incidents are alleged to have happened. It is important to understand that children who were sexually abused often do not take any remedial action until they are much older, Waks said. It could be due to shame, guilt, confusion and/or pressure  depending on the individual and their circumstances. But regardless of when remedial action is taken, often the impact of the abuse is long-lasting. Perpetrators and their enablers should always be held to full account, irrespective of the length of time after the abuse. It should be left to the judicial process to determine the veracity of such serious allegations. Victoria Police would not comment on the investigation or the extradition proceedings. http://www.jewishnews.net.au/child-molester-jailed-as-police-seek-extradition/26237 News (20-7-2011)- Police wrote to former Yeshivah College students earlier this year, urging them to contact Crime Stoppers if they had been assaulted between 1989 and 1993. The investigation was mainly linked to former teacher David Kramer, who fled Australia in the early 1990s after parents complained he had sexually abused students. Police hope to extradite Kramer when he has served a seven-year prison sentence in the US for sodomising a 12-year-old boy. - - http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/synagogue-asks-alleged-child-molester-to-stand-down-20110719-1hne0.html|/images/david_kramer_2.jpg

SAMUEL KRIS (QLD- Sarina)|27 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Paedophile. Convicted of a child sex offence in Queensland. News (7-2-2011)- "Sex offender didn't supply new address"- Sarina resident Samuel Kris is a registered child sex offender who failed to notify police of a change of residential address. Kris, 27, pleaded guilty in the Mackay Magistrates Court on Friday to failing to report under his obligations as a registered offender under the Australian National Child (Sex) Offender Register, known as ANCOR. He was convicted of a child sex offence in Queensland and has been on the register since May, 2008, and he has to remain on the register for 15 years, police prosecutor Elizabeth Cassells said. Among the many conditions of being on the register is a requirement to notify police of any change of residential address if he changes address for more than 14 days at a time. On November 11 last year police became aware that Kris had not been living at his registered address for more than 14 days. Detectives from the Child Protection Investigation Unit located him at an address in Penfold Street and he told them he had been living there for 16 days, Ms Cassells said. After being told by detectives that he would be charged, he moved out of the Penfold Street address back into his old address, Ms Cassells said. Kris had a previous conviction for a similar offence in February 2009, so this was his second breach in two-and-a-half years, Ms Cassells said. Acting magistrate Ron Muirhead said it was important that registered sex offenders comply with the conditions imposed on them by ANCOR. If you come back for a third offence, a prison sentence is likely, Mr Muirhead said. Mr Muirhead fined Kris $900. http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2011/02/07/sex-offender-didnt-notify-of-new-address/
DAVID AUGUST KRUHSE (NT)|43 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced December 2011, in the NT Supreme Court, to 10 months jail - suspended after serving 5 months.|David Kruhse - Pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography. News (24-12-2011)- "Child porn guilty plea"- A man charged with possessing child pornography would not have broken the law if he had sex with a 16-year-old girl but will spend five months in prison for looking at a picture of one, a court heard this week. David August Kruhse, 43, pleaded guilty in the NT Supreme Court to possessing 2262 child abuse images and 269 movies on his computer. But his lawyer, Peter Elliott, told Justice Stephen Southwood that Kruhse only had an interest in looking at "attractive" 16 or 17-year-old girls. "If he had actually engaged in sexual activity he wouldn't be committing a crime," he said. Crown prosecutor Lisa Brown said the relevant legislation defined a child as being under 18 years. She said 23 images and 31 movies were in the worst two categories which showed children engaged in sexual activity with adults. But Mr Elliott said his client simply downloaded a file off the internet and did not look at all of the images. "You don't choose ... It's not like a big display (of pictures) and you say I want this one and this one," he said. "He is a regular with the exception of this (incident) Territory bloke." Justice Southwood said during sentencing Kruhse yesterday that the material was "dumped" on his computer and he may not have known images of the worst category were in the file. But he said the rigger was an "intelligent" person who intentionally sought child porn on the internet for his own gratification, something that caused its production. "The community strongly disapproves of such behaviour," he said. He convicted and sentenced Kruhse to 10 months jail to be suspended after serving five months. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2011/12/24/279881_ntnews.html

"Sex offender to stay behind bars" (8-12-2011) A serial sex offender who raped a six-year-old local boy and assaulted a group of girls while they were in Cairns on a school excursion has been jailed indefinitely. Yarrabah man Gregory David Kynuna has been in and out of jail for sexual assaults since 1987, when he broke into a Cairns hostel and inappropriately touched a number of girls who were staying there while on a school excursion. The 47-year-old was sentenced to six years jail in 2004 for luring a six-year-old boy away from his Cairns home and raping him. His sentence was extended after he indecently assaulted a female tutor in the jail, but he was released in July this year on strict conditions. Kynuna breached those conditions by the end of the month when he failed to keep to his curfew and he tested positive for cannabis. In a Supreme Court of Queensland decision published on Monday, Attorney-General Paul Lucas was successful in keeping Kynuna behind bars indefinitely. Psychiatrists had noted Kynunas risk of reoffending was "very high" if he did not adhere to curfews and maintain a drug-free lifestyle. " in my view, it is currently impossible to describe his potential for reoffending, either violently or sexually, as less than very high," one doctor reported. "In my opinion, it would be prudent at this time for Mr Kynuna to remain a resident of an institution, either in prison or preferably a maximum-security psychiatric hospital, and for the situation to be reviewed when he has been so resident of a period of 12 months." http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2011/12/08/195441_local-news.html http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/rapist-released-despite-sexual-assault-on-female-jail-tutor/story-e6freoof-1226083912155

SHAUN LADD (NT - Darwin, Arnhem Land)|28 yrs old (2006)|Sentenced in 2006, to 2 yrs and 9 months jail - Sentence suspended after 2 yrs..eligible for release on August 24, 2008.|Shaun Ladd - Paedophile- Attempted to rape a 6 yr old girl at a remote Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory.. The victim was saved when her mother came into the house and stopped the attempted rape. "NT man jailed for attempted child rape" (20-12-2006) A man has been jailed for two years for trying to rape a six-year-old girl in a drunken haze at a remote Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory. Shaun Ladd lured the girl to an empty house at a community in Arnhem Land, east of Darwin, on April 12 this year. The 28-year-old had consumed as least three cans of VB and three casks of wine when he went into his friend's home for bread and beef, the Northern Territory Supreme Court heard. He took the girl, who cannot be named, with him when he left the home after persuading her to help him prepare the food in an adjacent house. "You entered the unoccupied house with the victim, you then grabbed her with both arms, forced her into a rear bedroom and locked the door from the inside," said Acting Justice Leslie Trevor Olsson. Ladd then removed both of their clothes and forced the victim on a mattress on the floor. When she cried out "you placed your hand over her mouth," Justice Olsson said. The victim was saved when her mother came into the house and stopped the attempted rape. "The victim's mother entered the house and located her daughter in a naked and distressed condition." Justice Olsson, who sentenced Ladd to two years and nine months in prison, to be suspended after two years, said the little girl now suffered from nightmares. Her family had also been forced to move out of the community, with her father losing his job as a ranger. "It is said you are ashamed of your actions which have had a serious effect," he told the court. "Your victim was a defenceless girl, only six years of age, and having regard to your relationship with her family what occurred was in a real sense a breach of trust. "Had it not been for the actions of your victim's mother at the time there seems little doubt she would have been raped." Ladd will be eligible for release on August 24, 2008. http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/NT-man-jailed-for-attempted-child-rape/2006/12/20/1166290610318.html

They include quite appalling images of child abuse of the most depraved kind, he said. FBI traps child pornography fiend (7-12-2010) A Sunshine Coast man was jailed yesterday for downloading images and movies of babies and children engaged in sexual acts of incest, bestiality and bondage. Police, acting on an FBI tip-off, raided Adam Stanley Lambs home and found almost 20,000 photographs and movies. They were on two external hard drives, a laptop and a mobile phone when police raided his house in May this year. Mr Lamb had used his credit card to subscribe and access child pornography websites. Police received a tip-off after the FBI informed online payment company Paypal in Switzerland in January 2007 about Mr Lambs downloads and had his credit card cancelled. Judge John Robertson described the material as shocking and horrifying when Mr Lamb faced Maroochydore District Court. They include quite appalling images of child abuse of the most depraved kind, he said. Police found 1523 movies and 17464 images across the four data sources at his home.http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/fbi-sunshine-coast-child-pornography-fiend-incest/715891/

DAMIEN JOHN LANCASTER (VIC)|28 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in Feb 2008, in the Melbourne County Court,to 12.5 yrs jail - 9.5 yrs non parole.|Damien Lancaster - Pleaded guilty to 12 charges, including 3 counts of rape, 3 of indecent assault, and one count of kidnapping.. Has prior convictions for indecent assault dating back to 1999 News (7-2-2008)- "Man jailed for 12 years for horriffic sexual assault"- A man who broke into a woman's home and subjected her to a horrific and prolonged sexual assault has been sentenced to 12-and-a-half years' jail. Damien John Lancaster, 24, was ordered to serve a minimum term of nine-and-a-half years for the attack on a woman in her North Melbourne home on June 23 last year. Judge Frank Shelton said the attack, in which the victim was threatened with a knife and told she would be raped and her dog stabbed, was "every woman's worst nightmare''. The County Court heard Lancaster, who had been chroming paint, forced the woman, aged in her 20s, to perform oral sex twice, digitally raped her, slapped her and kissed and groped her during the ordeal. The woman suggested they walk to a nearby service station after Lancaster said he wanted to get some cigarettes. At the service station the woman asked a staff member to call the police and Lancaster ran off. "Your offending was quite horrific as you terrified your victim for an hour and three-quarters,'' Judge Shelton said. The court heard Lancaster was already on the sex offenders register at the time, having had five prior convictions for indecent assault dating back to 1999. Lancaster pleaded guilty to 12 charges in relation to last year's attack, including three counts of rape, three of indecent assault and one count of kidnapping. Judge Shelton said the victim felt obliged to move house, still suffered heightened emotions, couldn't bear to be in the dark and her sleep was effected. But he said she was a woman of strong character and was determined to overcome the effect of her horrific experience. Judge Shelton said Lancaster's offending generally resulted from his dependence on inhalants, having commenced chroming when he was 14 years old. Lancaster claimed to have been sexually abused by a family member between the ages of seven and nine and saw himself as a marginalised outsider, in part because of a speech impediment, the judge said. But he said Lancaster had co-operated fully with police and had indicated he would plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. Lancaster will remain on the sex offenders' register and will be required to report for life. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/years-for-nightmarish-sexual-attack/story-e6frf7kx-1111115496253

Ex-bus driver's child porn guilt (1-9-2011) A former school bus driver has pleaded guilty to storing child exploitation material on his computer. Russell Robert Langfield, 53, of Kimberley, had his internet usage tracked by a Queensland Police taskforce that was investigating a child pornography website before his computer was seized by Tasmania Police in September last year. It was found to contain 307 photos and 16 video files categorised as child exploitation material which were stored in files with names such as "bus folder" and "schoolies". He told the police at the time that he considered the images, mostly low-level pornography of children posing, as "artistic" not pornographic. Langfield's defence counsel Tamara Jago said most of the images did not involve sexual activity. Ms Jago said Langfield had an interest in adult pornography and the amount of material he downloaded which offended the law was very small. She said Langfield, an organic farmer, was now in a relationship and had lost his interest in porn. "He is ashamed and embarrassed by the charges," she said. Langfield is no longer employed as a school bus driver. He will be sentenced on September 7. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/09/01/258135_scalesofjustice.html
KEITH PHILLIP LANGTON (Keith Langton) (SA - Moonta/ Yorke Peninsula)|79 yrs old (2007)|Sentenced in July 2007, in the SA District Court, to 18 months jail - 9 months non parole.. The Sentence was suspended the sentence and the court imposed a two-year, $500 good behaviour bond.|Keith Phillip Langton - Former Seventh Day Adventist Church official/ School Superintendent.. Pleaded guilty to the sexual abuse of a seven-year-old girl. "Child abuser avoids prison" (21-7-2007) A former Seventh Day Adventist Church official has avoided jail after pleading guilty to the sexual abuse of a seven-year-old girl. Keith Phillip Langton, 79, of Moonta on Yorke Peninsula, pleaded guilty to one count of indecent assault, which occurred 27 years ago. A similar charge was dropped by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions as part of the plea bargain deal. Langton, who was a school superintendent with the church at the time of the offending, was arrested by Pedophile Task Force detectives in September 2005 following a long investigation. In sentencing Langton in the District Court on Wednesday, Judge Gordon Barrett said, although he was only being sentenced on the basis there was that single offence, he did "not entirely accept" this incident "was so isolated that it can be said to have come out of the blue". "On the basis of the statement of the victim, I find that you had a sexual interest in her, but you largely managed to suppress it," he said. Judge Barrett said Langton had always been troubled by the abuse and had "made a couple of ineffective efforts to express your remorse". "I accept that you have made a form of confession to the girl's father, who unhelpfully said that if he had a gun he would shoot you," he told Langton. "I find also that you admitted in a general way to her mother that you had done something wrong. "You have never made a proper apology to the girl and you seem to be in a form of denial about it." Judge Barrett said Langton had attended seven sessions of counselling after police became aware of the offending, but had discontinued it. He said Langton had specifically denied to a psychiatrist the act which constitutes the offence "to which you have pleaded guilty". "While your religion has given you some assistance in dealing with your feelings of recrimination about what you did, it has not helped you tender a simple apology to the girl, who is now a 34-year-old woman," he said. "Now that these proceedings are over, you may care to reflect on that". Judge Barrett said if it was not for Langton's guilty plea he would have fixed a sentence of two years. He instead imposed an 18-month sentence with a non-parole period of nine months. He then suspended the sentence and imposed a two-year, $500 good behaviour bond. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/child-abuser-avoids-prison/story-e6frea83-1111114010845
RODNEY LARCOMBE (Deceased Nov, 2013) (SA - Adelaide, Warradale, Kildonan Road)|65 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in 2010 in the SA District Court, to 20 months jail - 12 months non parole.. Sentence suspended - 3 yr good behaviour bond.|Rodney Larcombe - Pleaded guilty in 2010 to eight counts of indecent assault. "Warradale murder victim Rodney Larcombe, 65, was a sex offender" (29-11-2013) A man found murdered in his Warradale home is known to police and has a history of sexual offences, The Advertiser understands. The Advertiser believes the man, who police say met a violent death, is Rodney Larcombe, 65. Police say he lived alone in the property but had been sharing with a younger man for a period of time. The younger man has been ruled out as a suspect. Police do not believe this was a random attack and have described the murder as "a whodunit". Police would not comment on the man's criminal record but say he is known to them. However, The Advertiser can reveal Larcombe was a convicted sex offender who finished a three-year good behaviour bond just two weeks before he was killed, In November 2010, the District Court sentenced Larcombe to 20 months' jail, following his guilty pleas to eight counts of indecent assault. Between January 1, 1977 and December 31, 1998, Larcombe sexually abused the same victim - whose identity is suppressed under state law - at Warradale, Somerton Park and Outer Harbour. Judge Sydney Tilmouth agreed to suspend Larcombe's sentence, and his 12-month non-parole period, on condition he enter into a three-year good behaviour bond. That bond expired on November 15 this year. Dozens of police are searching the streets of Warradale for clues after Larcombe was found murdered in his bedroom yesterday. His body was found by his sister around 4pm yesterday in the bedroom of a house on Kildonan Road. He was last seen alive yesterday at lunchtime. Sturt CIB and Major Crime Detectives are investigating and treating the death as a murder, SAPOL said this morning. A small section of Kildonan Road remains closed to all traffic between Mattson Avenue and Struan Avenue. A post-mortem examination will be conducted to determine the cause of the man's death.|/images/Rodney_Larcombe.jpg

Dangerous WA sex offender Edward William Latimer released from prison - News (1-7-2014)|Edward William Latimer - Sex Offender..Latimer has numerous convictions, including aggravated sexual penetration and attempted rape. The first dangerous sex offender to be indefinitely jailed under a West Australian law has been released from prison under a strict five-year supervision order. "Dangerous WA sex offender Edward William Latimer released from prison" (1-7-2014) The first dangerous sex offender to be indefinitely jailed under a West Australian law has been released from prison under a strict five-year supervision order. Edward William Latimer, who has a history of aggravated sexual penetration without consent and wilful exposure, was the first person dealt with under WAs 2006 Dangerous Sexual Offenders Act. The release comes a week after dangerous WA sex offender Patrick Comeagain was released by a Supreme Court judge, despite his high risk of reoffending. Latimer, who was jailed in 2005, learned after his seventh annual review today that he would be released into the community. While a WA Supreme Court judge noted in 2011 that there had been a regression in Latimers planned program of socialisation, Justice Lindy Jenkins said he had made steady, positive progress over the past three years in his engagement with counselling and a treatment program. Consultant forensic psychiatrist Peter Wynn Owen reported to Justice Jenkins that Latimer had shown an improved attitude towards other people  particularly those in authority  and towards his release plan, and had adjusted to the less structured environment of the minimum-security Karnet Prison Farm. .

Brisbane-based Court of Appeal judge Robert Gotterson on Tuesday granted an application by Queenslands Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie to stop the release of Lawrence from custody by way of a strict supervised release order. Lawyers for Mr Bleijie launched stay proceedings of Friday after Supreme Court judge Philip McMurdo ordered the killer be released from custody and set aside a decision made in 2008 that required the prisoners ongoing detention because he was a serious danger to the community.  .

JULIAN MARC LAWTON (QLD- Rockhampton)|25 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 11-2-2011, in the Rockhampton District Court, to 7 yrs jail.|Julian Lawton - found guilty of 2 counts of rape, 1 count attempted rape. Victim was a young Aboriginal woman. Co-offenders - Joshua Peter Marshall and Davin Roy Butler. News (11-2-2011)- "Trio sentenced for gang rape"- Three men found guilty of the pack rape of a young Aboriginal woman have each been sentenced in the Rockhampton District Court today to between seven and eight-and-a-half years in prison. Judge Grant Britton delivered his judgment after hearing submissions from Crown Prosecutor Joshua Phillips and defence lawyers yesterday. A jury took four hours to come to a verdict which found Joshua Peter Marshall, 20, Davin Roy Butler, 23, and Julian Marc Lawton, 25, each guilty of two counts of rape and one of attempted rape. During the trial the court heard that Butler and Marshall had sex with the woman without her consent at a park near the South Rockhampton Memorial Pool on December 14, 2007. Lawton was also guilty of rape because he aided and assisted the other two by his presence and also the violence he showed towards the complainant. Judge Britton sentenced Lawton to seven years in prison to reflect his lesser involvement while Marshall was sentenced to eight years and Butler eight-and-a-half years. EARLIER: THREE men have been found guilty of a brutal gang rape of a young Aboriginal woman in a Rockhampton park more than three years ago. A jury deliberated for more than four hours before finding Davin Roy Butler, 23, Joshua Peter Marshall, 20, and Julian Marc Lawton, 25, each guilty of two counts of rape and one off attempted rape yesterday afternoon. Family members of the convicted rapists wept in the public gallery after the verdicts were read out. Judge Grant Britton after hearing submissions from Crown Prosecutor Joshua Phillips and defence lawyers for the trio adjourned the court and will deliver his sentence this morning. Mr Phillips asked for a sentence of between eight and nine years for each man. During the trial the court heard that the men had sex with the woman without her consent at a park near the South Rockhampton Memorial Pool on December 14, 2007. Mr Phillips told the court Marshall and Butler had taken turns to rape her while Lawton was also responsible because of the words uttered and the violence he had displayed towards her. He told jurors the case stands and falls on their assessment of her credibility. In a statement the complainant said she was raped by Marshall while the other two men held her down and hit her repeatedly. She said Butler then attempted to orally rape her but she bit him on the penis. Butler then raped the woman while the other two held her down again. Ross Lo Monaco, appearing for Lawton, said because his client did not physically take part in the acts of rape his sentence should be significantly discounted. He finds himself in this mess because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He had also not taken advantage of the situation for his own sexual gratification. Jeff Clarke, who represented Marshall, said his client was just 17-years-old at the time of the incident. He was illiterate and educated to a grade eight level. He asked for a reduced penalty because of his young age at the time and lack of criminal history. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/story/2011/02/11/trio-guilty-of-gang-rape-butler-marshall-lawton/|/images/julian_marc_lawton_2.jpg

Leary repeatedly bashed the teenage girl on the head with a hammer before removing her clothes and sexually assaulting her... Released on Parole August/2012. Update June 2013 - Leary has been charged with 8 offences relating to a violent attack of a 30-year-old woman at Hunters Hill, NSW -Below. "Murderer on parole was trying to kill again during bus stop attack, court documents show" (20-6-2013) A murderer on parole was trying to kill again when he allegedly stabbed a woman and tried to rape her at a Sydney bus stop, court documents reveal. Terrence John Leary, 46, has been charged with eight offences relating to a violent attack of a 30-year-old woman at Hunters Hill at 6pm on Wednesday. Leary, on parole after serving 22 years of a 24-year sentence for the 1990 murder of 17-year-old Vanessa Hoson, is accused of wounding the woman with intent to murder, documents before Parramatta Local Court show. He is also accused of assaulting three officers after witnesses called police to alert them to the alleged sexual assault. The attack took place only a short distance from where Mr Leary had been ordered to live as part of his parole conditions. Attorney-General Greg Smith said the State Parole Authority immediately revoked Leary's parole upon learning of the alleged breach on Thursday morning. Mr Smith said the convicted killer was paroled in August last year, after being refused parole on six occasions between 2005 and 2010. The man's 15-year non-parole period expired on January 13, 2005. The victim of the alleged bus stop attack was punched and stabbed by Leary, who then attempted to undress her and rape her, police said. A passing motorist, who saw the woman being attacked, called triple-0 and tried to help her. The woman had allegedly been dragged to the ground and stabbed in the shoulder with a pocket knife. Leary was allegedly attempting to pull off the woman's clothes when police arrived at the bus stop on Alexandra Street, which is located next to Hunters Hill Public School near the intersection with Stanley Road. Officers say they were forced to use capsicum spray and Taser Leary, who allegedly lashed out at police when they tried to arrest him. A probationary constable was allegedly punched in the face during the confrontation. The woman and officer were treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to Royal North Shore Hospital. The woman suffered a punctured lung, a fractured cheekbone and bruising, and remained in hospital on Thursday. The officer received two stitches for a cut to his lip and was later released from hospital. A NSW Police spokeswoman said the woman was simply waiting at the bus stop when she was allegedly set upon by Leary, whom she did not know. The spokeswoman said Leary had initially approached the woman and struck up a conversation with her before allegedly assaulting her. The woman fought back and screamed but was allegedly stabbed in the shoulder, before the passing motorist intervened. Neighbours also heard the woman's screams and rushed outside to help. Police cordoned off the bus shelter on Wednesday night and examined the area forensically. Leary was taken to Ryde police station where he was charged with inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, reckless wounding and assaulting police causing actual bodily harm. He did not appear in court when the matter was briefly mentioned on Thursday afternoon. He did not apply for bail and it was formally refused. Leary will remain in jail until the matter is next heard in August. 1990 murder - Ms Hoson's near-naked body was found dumped in a car park, and had severe and multiple head injuries. Leary told police he broke into the sleeping woman's home to have sex, but when she refused, he hit her with a hammer. He was jailed for up to 24 years by a Supreme Court judge, who also set a minimum term of 15 years behind bars. Leary was "a danger to the community" and should not be released during the maximum term of 24 years unless assessments showed he was no longer dangerous, the judge said. The judge also found the then-24-year-old suffered an abnormal personality, had consumed alcohol and probably smoked marijuana when he attacked Ms Hoson. Leary changed his plea to guilty on the 11th day of his trial. The court heard Leary had gone to the Hoson family house on January 14, 1990 after drinking a large amount of alcohol at a party earlier in the evening. He knew her as "no more than an acquaintance" but climbed a ladder into the house, and after Ms Hoson refused him sex, he repeatedly bashed her on the head with a hammer before removing her clothes and sexually assaulting her. The judge said a life sentence was not appropriate because of his disturbed state of mind. Out on parole Mr Smith said Leary's 15-year non-parole period expired on January 13, 2005. He was paroled in August last year, after being refused parole on six different occasions between 2005 and 2010. "He had served 22 years of a 24-year sentence; he had almost seven months remaining on his balance of parole, Mr Smith said in a statement. The State Parole Authority [SPA] originally decided to grant parole after considering submissions from the Serious Offenders Review Council and the victims family. He said the SPA had immediately revoked Leary's parole upon learning of the alleged breach on Thursday morning. In light of recent events in Victoria, last week I asked Corrective Services NSW for a review of the handling of serious sex offenders on parole. This review has now been widened to include the handling of serious offenders whose offence had a sexual component, he said. This year, he also had asked the Law Reform Commission to review the parole system to see how it could be done better. "This will be a detailed and broad review," Mr Smith said. "We are tough on violent offenders and to protect the community we have introduced laws that can keep repeat serious violent offenders in custody or under supervision beyond the end of their sentence," he said. "Laws allowing the detention or extended supervision of serious sex offenders have already existed for several years." Complied with conditions A spokeswoman for the Department of Corrective Services said Leary's case had regularly been reviewed over his time in custody and until the alleged offence on Wednesday he had complied with all of his supervision conditions. While his previous conviction was for murder, he had undergone sex offender treatment programs in recognition of the sexual nature of his original offence. In addition, he was about to be considered for an Extended Supervision Order under the new High Risk Sex (and Violent) Offender provisions, which can only come into force six months before a full sentence expires. Parole had been granted "after considering a submission from the Serious Offenders Review Council and taking into account representations from the victims family". According to his parole conditions, he was banned from drinking alcohol and taking drugs. He was also ordered to take drug and alcohol tests, undergo psychological assessment and counselling as determined and not to contact the victims family. "He was also banned from frequenting or visiting a number of Local Government Areas including the Hills Shire, where the original offence occurred," the spokeswoman said. "The offender was supervised according to the requirements of his parole conditions including receiving urinalysis and breath testing, home visits and regular contact with specialist psychological services. He was also in regular contact with police." http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/murderer-on-parole-was-trying-to-kill-again-during-bus-stop-attack-court-documents-show-20130620-2ok7r.html#ixzz2Wk8Qv2QV
DANIEL JOHN LEASK (WA- Perth)|22 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in November 2012, in the District Court of Western Australia, to a 3 yr good behaviour bond,100 hours of community service and placed under an intense supervision order.. Leask faces a possible 3.5 yrs jail if he breaches the bond or the order.|Daniel John Leask- Pleaded guilty to inciting girls aged 13-15 yrs online. News (16-11-2012)- "Online Perth sex predator avoids prison" A man who persuaded young girls in the US and Australia to perform sexual acts via video chat websites - and then threatened to expose them to friends and family if they did not continue doing it - has escaped a jail sentence. Daniel John Leask, 22, pleaded guilty to inciting the girls, who were aged between 13 and 15, to perform various sex acts as he watched them on his laptop at his Perth home in 2010 and 2011. He also admitted blackmailing them with threats of exposure if they stopped. The first victim, who lived in the US, was just 14 when Leask befriended her online and persuaded her to remove her clothes and masturbate, while he watched on a webcam. When she eventually objected, Leask threatened to hack into her computer and reveal her behaviour. When the girl deleted Leask from her social media circle, he tracked her down through an instant messaging service, told her he had recorded their previous exchange and threatened to post the video online. He then contacted the girl's mother under an alias, and told her her daughter had been recorded performing sexual acts online. The girl's mother contacted US authorities, who tipped off the Australian Federal Police. Four more girls suffered similar persuasion and coercion, two in America, one in Victoria and one in NSW, who was the youngest victim at just 13. She was persuaded to expose herself and then threatened with exposure to her parents if she did not perform more explicit acts, which she eventually did. She told her brother, who contacted Australian authorities. In the District Court of Western Australia, Judge Kevin Sleight said the damage caused to the victims meant they had been humiliated and sexually corrupted by Leask. He rejected a suggestion Leask had made to police that he was a "white knight'' persuading teenagers not to have sex online. "You used threats to keep all of these girls involved in sexual activity on the screen,'' Judge Sleight said. He revealed that Leask had been driven to his offending after he had suffered a similar experience when he was 17. Leask was coerced by an unnamed man to perform a sexual act online, with the video published on the internet. This led to him being bullied and humiliated, causing him to suffer severe depression. Judge Sleight said he had serious concerns for Leask's welfare if he was sent to prison, given his mental health and immaturity. Leask was given a three-year good behaviour bond, ordered to perform 100 hours of community service and placed under an intense supervision order. He faces a possible three and a half years in jail if he breaches the bond or the order. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/online-perth-sex-predator-avoids-prison/story-e6frg13u-1226518233067

DEAN ALAN LECORNU (VIC)|32 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in 2011, in the County Court, to 20 months jail - 13 months non parole|Downloaded child pornography onto mobile phones. Also had magazines featuring the nude child photography of artist Bill Henson sent to him at a secure village for sex offenders. Dean Lecornu has a long and disturbing history including the rape of a schoolgirl and trying to attack children in school toilets at knifepoint. News (6-7-2011)- "Paedophile who had Bill Henson art sent to him jailed over child porn"- A paedophile who had magazines featuring the nude child photography of artist Bill Henson sent to him at a secure village for sex offenders has been jailed for keeping child pornography. But the controversial Henson images were not illegal - unlike the 19 pictures of naked and abused children Dean Alan Lecornu had stored on mobile phones he smuggled in under the noses of supervisors. Lecornu was yesterday jailed for 20 months for downloading child pornography on the mobile phones and breaching a supervision order imposed to protect the community from him. The court heard that Lecornu used "arguably innocent pictures" for "depraved purposes". He was living under strict security with other sex offenders at Corella Place, known as the "Village of the Damned", when he had copies of magazines including Art Monthly sent to him. Yesterday County Court Judge Sue Pullen refused to allow Lecornu to keep the anonymity he had been afforded in the four years he has been on a supervision order. The decision came just days after the Herald Sun launched its Open Justice campaign, seeking that laws banning the identities of offenders "in the public interest" be scrapped and hearings involving our most dangerous rapists and paedophiles be openly reported. Judge Pullen noted that suppression of Lecornu's name had not stopped him from offending or breaching the supervision order. It was no longer in the public interest to keep his identity secret, the judge said. Lecornu, 32, has a long and disturbing history including the rape of a schoolgirl and trying to attack children in school toilets at knifepoint. The Justice Department asked for Lecornu's name to be published after yesterday's sentence, saying there was little evidence of rehabilitation. The court heard he had ordered the magazines for their "material depicting near naked children ... for the purpose of satisfying (his) masturbatory desires while on the Extended Supervision Order and from within Corella Place". After being caught with the magazines Lecornu had been warned about his behaviour but still brought in the phones and downloaded child pornography. One of the offences happened just a week after his supervision order had been reviewed. Staff tried to search his unit in September last year but he blocked his door and after a brief standoff staff entered and found two mobile phones. When police came to search again in December he struggled with officers as they tried to seize another phone. A spare phone was also found. Lecornu claimed he was bored living at Corella Place, only socialising with other sex offenders. His lawyer had asked for Lecornu's punishment to be "time served" with a further jail sentence suspended. But Judge Pullen said she must consider community protection and jailed him for 20 months, with a minimum of 13 months. Henson's work came under fire after police seized his photographs of a 13-year-old girl from a Sydney gallery in 2008. They later found he had not committed any crime. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/paedophile-who-had-bill-henson-art-sent-to-him-jailed-over-child-porn/story-fn7x8me2-1226088573951

Sex offender sentenced (11-3-2011) A Warranambool man with an intellectual disability has been placed on a five-year intensive residential treatment order after pleading guilty to sex offences. Timothy Leishman, 30, of Fairy Street, appeared in the Warrnambool County Court on five charges and pleaded guilty during October last year to one charge of committing an indecent act with a child under 16 and four counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16. He was remanded in custody while reports were prepared with respect to his suitability for a treatment order in a facility of incarceration, treatment and rehabilitation for sex offenders with intellectual disabilities. Mr Leishman has two prior convictions for indecent assault among a long history of offending. On February 22 this year he was sentenced after County Court Judge David Parsons received reports. Mr Leishman pleaded guilty to five charges, including sexual penetration of a child aged under 16 years, which came out of incidents in the Camperdown district during February last year. The court heard Leishman moved to Warrnambool in 1995 and went to the special development school before attending TAFE in 1998 where he was involved in damaging a lift which cost thousands of dollars to repair. He has since worked on variety of jobs including fruit picking, milking, motor wrecking and cutting firewood. He also has seven children with five different women. He has been classified as having an intellectual disability and has also been registered as a sex offender for life. Experts assessed him as currently presenting a serious risk of violence to another person. http://www.standard.net.au/news/local/news/general/sex-offender-sentenced/2100165.aspx

Mark Anthony Leonard-Major, 29, pleaded guilty in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday to procuring a teenage boy to engage in a sexual act between September 1 and October 17, 2013. Crown prosecutor Katrina Overell said Leonard-Major met and struck up a friendship at a Brisbane scout group where he was a headmaster. She said the relationship became sexualised when the accused began to make comments and gestures towards the boy, even buying him a mobile phone so they could text one another in secret. The court heard Leonard-Major instructed the boy to delete any text messages between them. Ms Overell said the clandestine relationship, played out in part in 86 text messages over 13 days, was unearthed when the phone was discovered by the childs mother. She said the boy was interviewed by police on October 18, 2013 when he detailed the sexualised nature of his friendship with Leonard-Major. .

Sentence reduced on appeal in March 2013 to 23yrs 6 months jail/ 13yrs non parole.|Abducted and sexually assaulted an 8 yr old girl, in Sydney's west, in Feb 2010. Pleaded guilty in August 2011, to 2 counts of aggravated sexual assault with a person under the age of 10 and to a count of attempted sexual intercourse. "Jail time reduced for man who raped 8yo" (1-3-2013) A man who abducted an eight-year-old girl from her western Sydney home and raped her in bushland has had his prison sentence reduced. Jai Leonard Leslie was jailed for at least 16 years and two months after pleading guilty to charges that included aggravated sexual assault. His maximum sentence was 23 years. Today the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has reduced the minimum sentence to 13 years. When the 22-year-old was sentenced the state's District Court heard the eight-year-old victim was asleep in a lounge room at a house in Tregear with a friend in 2010 when she woke up during the night to find Leslie sitting on a couch near her. "Where's my mother?" she asked him. Leslie told the child her mother might have been at a house nearby. The court heard that he then dragged the girl by her shirt from the house. The eight-year-old victim cannot be named for legal reasons. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-01/jail-time-reduced-for-man-who-raped-8yo/4547270 "Rapist jailed for 23 years after abducting girl during friend's sleepover" (11-1-2012) A man who abducted an eight-year-old girl from her home in Sydney's west during the night before he raped her in nearby bushland has been jailed for more than 23 years. Jai Leonard Leslie, 21, was today sentenced in the District Court for the abduction and aggravated sexual assault of the girl in February 2010. He pleaded guilty in August last year to two counts of aggravated sexual assault with a person under the age of 10, having inflicted her with actual bodily harm during the attack. He also pleaded guilty to a count of attempted sexual intercourse with the complainant. The eight-year-old, who cannot be identified, had been asleep in the lounge room in the Tregear house with a visiting friend when she awoke during the night to find Leslie sitting near her. She asked him "where's my mum" and the offender said she might have been at a friend's house so suggested the child take a walk with him to find her. The complainant later told police that Leslie "dragged" her by the shirt from the house. A short time later, now holding her hand, he suggested they try to find the girl's mother in nearby bushland - but it was here that the sexual assault began. Leslie told the youngster: "If you don't [comply] I'm going to kill you." After committing two acts of sexual assault on her, Leslie returned her to the property and "told her not to tell her mum", Judge Helen Syme said. The next morning, the child told her mother and sister of the pain she was in. DNA evidence was directly linked to Leslie, who initially denied knowing where he was that night as he had been drinking alcohol heavily and taking drugs. "Well I can't remember much that night so I'm not, not sure if I done it to tell you the truth, 'cause all this stuff's going on and some of the people are making allegations ... I know this, if I done it I can't remember that I've done it but if I've done it then I've done it - and I feel sorry for the little girl too," he told police in a recorded interview. Finally he admitted being in Tregear that night and pleaded guilty. Judge Syme said Leslie used threats or pressure before and after the offence to ensure the victim's compliance, and noted there had been some planning. But she said the immediate "fear, pain and confusion" created by the conduct had led to the serious likelihood of long-term consequences. "A separate and further consequence of the offence is the heightened fear within the community, which rightly expects their children to be safe inside their homes, especially at night," Judge Syme said. "This court is well aware of the potential consequences for children who suffer sexual assault when young - frequently they are serious and life-long." In this child's case, she said the "unchallenged opinion" was that "this child's prognosis of an early recovery is poor". Of equal concern is the "strong evidence of her self esteem being significantly compromised", notwithstanding what the psychologist refers to as a "substantial period of specialised treatment". In handing down the sentence today, Judge Syme said she also took into account a number of other matters, including detaining for advantage and entering a dwelling with intent to commit a serious offence. She sentenced Leslie to an overall jail term of 23 years and six months, with a non-parole period of 16 years and two months. He will be eligible for release on May 7, 2027, but only if he had made "satisfactory progress" on treatment programs in custody. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/rapist-jailed-for-23-years-after-abducting-girl-during-friends-sleepover-20120111-1put1.html#ixzz1jCX5RD58|/images/jai_leslie_1.jpg

AIDEN LESLIE LEWIS (Aidan Lewis) (VIC - Portland)|26 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to be updated.|Aidan Leslie Lewis- Pleaded guilty to using a communications service to groom a person aged under 16 years for sexual activity, using a communications service to have child pornography sent to him and two counts of accessing child pornography. "Sex predator groomed boy, 13, on Facebook and mobile phone" (26-12-2012) A sex predator pressured a 13-year-old boy he met on Facebook into taking and texting a naked photo of himself. Details of the mans attempts to groom the boy for sex emerged during a hearing in Warrnambool County Court yesterday. Aidan Leslie Lewis, 26, of Findlay Street, Portland, pleaded guilty to using a communications service to groom a person aged under 16 years for sexual activity, using a communications service to have child pornography sent to him and two counts of accessing child pornography. He will be sentenced next week. Judge Bill Stuart said the case was a classic example of the type of grooming new legislation aimed to address. The offences were uncovered when the victims mother found a naked photo on her sons phone. In a victim impact statement she said it was horrific to find her son had been the victim of such a predator. The boy said he had been through emotional trauma, felt embarrassed and humiliated and his parents now had a hard time trusting him. Police alleged that on May 25 last year the accused made contact with the teenager using the false account name of Aiden Ryan and began sending private messages through the popular internet social networking site. Those messages were exchanged for three days before the defendant asked for and obtained the victims mobile telephone number. Between May 28 and May 30, 228 text messages and two phone calls were exchanged. Lewis told the victim he wanted to chat on the phone and get to know him better while inquiring about his hobbies, whether he lived with his parents and his sexual preferences and practises. The defendant told the victim he had been hurt by younger guys and when assured by the victim he would not do so, Lewis said that was what the last guy said and that the experience had really hurt him. He told the boy he had been used, lent money to people and now found it hard to trust anyone, although he said the victim seemed different. Lewis told him he knew he was younger but it was hard to find the right people, saying he had mates who dated boys heaps younger. He also told the victim he would like to take him out on a date, see a movie, have dinner and then hug and kiss him, saying he was a babe, spunk, a hottie, he had a cute smile and sounded hot on the phone. The court heard that via the text messages Lewis repeatedly asked for explicit photos of the victim but when the boy became cautious Lewis turned the situation to his advantage and made it a trust issue. When the victim replied he may not have enough credit on his phone, Lewis transferred $5 to it. The following day he again repeatedly asked for a hot pic with pants off. The victim took a photo of his genitals on his mobile phone and sent it to Lewis. On August 11 police executed a search warrant at Lewis home and seized a mobile phone and three computers. A forensic examination of the computers revealed 51 images and nine videos with the images ranking up to the most sexually explicit category. Most of the material was of child exploitation. In an interview with police Lewis admitted there was probably child pornography on his computers and that he used a false Facebook account, but he couldnt recall conversations with the victim or asking him to send photos. Lewis answered no comment when it was put to him that his communications with the victim were as if he was developing a relationship, and when details of text messages suggesting they meet were read to him. He told police he thought the victim was 16 years old and he didnt know it was illegal to get someone to send an explicit photo. http://www.cvsa.com.au/?p=1359

Eligible for parole in March 2012.|Carl Lewis- Pleaded guilty to 1 count of indecent assault. Indecently assaulted a teenage girl during a sleepover at her friend's home News (31-8-2011)- "Jail for sleepover assault"- A teenage girl who had felt safe was left angry and distressed after being indecently assaulted by a stranger during a sleepover at a friend's home, a Hobart court heard yesterday. Carl Darren Lewis, 37, of Glenorchy, pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court in Hobart to one count of indecent assault. The court heard that the girl aged 16 was sleeping over with other girls at a friend's house on November 21 last year. Lewis, who was visiting the house for a birthday party, left and went into Hobart with other men. As the group's designated driver, he had returned to the house about 2am to return car keys. He went inside the house and saw the girl sleeping on a mattress just inside a bedroom. Justice Helen Wood said the girl awoke to discover Lewis indecently assaulting her. She was frozen with fear. "She made an immediate complaint," Justice Wood said. "She was shaking and hysterical." Lewis's lawyer Craig Rainbird had asked Justice Wood to consider a suspended sentence. However, Justice Wood said the crime was disturbing and one the complainant would struggle to cope with. She said it was necessary to impose a sentence as a general deterrent. Justice Wood sentenced Lewis to 15 months in jail, backdated to July 20, when he was first arrested. He will be eligible for parole in March. His name will be put on a sex offenders' register and he must report to authorities for eight years. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/08/31/257701_scalesofjustice.html

DAVID ALLAN LIEBELT (VIC- Portland)|52 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 12-1-2011, in the Geelong Magistrates Court, to 8 months jail - suspended for 2 yrs.|David Allan Liebelt- committed an indecent act with a child under 16 years. Portland sex offender in custody after refusing to obey register conditions..22-8-2011 A Portland sex offender who refuses to obey the conditions of being on the sex offenders' register has been remanded in custody for another fortnight to work out his legal options. David Allan Liebelt, 51, of Arthur Street, appeared in the Warrnambool Magistrates Court last week to apply for bail. He has been charged with three counts of failing to abide by conditions of the sex offenders' register. After hearing a bail application, Magistrate Jonathan Klestadt decided to further remand Mr Liebelt in custody until August 30. Mr Liebelt has already spent a month in custody after being arrested in Portland. The court heard that on January 12 this year in the Geelong Magistrates Court Mr Liebelt received an eight-month jail sentence which was suspended for two years after he committed an indecent act with a child under 16 years. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register and as part of those conditions had to report to police within seven days. On February 24 he attended the Hastings police station but refused to answer questions or provide details . Mr Liebelt was bailed to appear in the Frankston Magistrates Court on April 13 but failed to appear and a warrant was issued for his arrest. In mid-July Portland police arrested Mr Liebelt at his mother's Arthur Street home. She said he had been staying with her for a couple of months. A police officer involved in the case fears Mr Liebelt has no intentions of complying with the requirements of the sex offenders' register and is in denial about being on the register. Mr Liebelt told the court he wanted to make a clean start and did not believe he should plead guilty to something he didn't do. He said reports had found he was not a predator or paedophile . "I'm no trouble to society. It was a huge mistake on my behalf," Mr Liebelt said. Mr Klestadt said the accused man had to abide by the legislation but had demonstrated a lack of understanding about those requirements. "I'm not satisfied that if you were released on bail there is a reasonable chance you would turn up in court ," he said. http://www.standard.net.au/news/local/news/general/portland-sex-offender-in-custody-after-refusing-to-obey-register-conditions/2265351.aspx
JOHN EDWARD LILJESTROM (NSW - Toormina)|53 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 17-3-2010, in the Coffs Harbour District Court, to 18 months in weekend detention at the Grafton Correctional Centre/ 6 months non parole and a 2 yr suspended jail term.|John Edward Liljestrom - Pleaded guilty to charges of using a carriage service to access child pornography and for possession of child pornography. News (18-3-2010)- "Caught with 4427 child porn images" Hetty Johnston, has expressed anger at the leniency of the sentence imposed on a Toormina man caught with thousands of sexually explicit images of children. John Edward Liljestrom, 51, was free to walk from the Coffs Harbour District Court yesterday after admitting he downloaded 4427 images of children, some as young as three, over a two-year period. Sitting Judge Hosking ordered Liljestrom to serve 18 months in weekend detention at the Grafton Correctional Centre, while imposing a two-year suspended jail term should he re-offend. This is a matter of supply and demand, while offenders are downloading these images of children being raped, tortured and abused, they are creating the necessity for this material on the internet, Ms Johnston said. Downloading child pornography is not a victimless crime. I believe the two-strike rule should apply, where the offender is given the benefit of the doubt for the first offence, but if they re-offend again then they should be locked up and the key thrown away. Police raided his Toormina home last February seizing two computer hard drives and a collection of DVDs. Liljestrom told the court he had been fascinated by the material. .|/images/john_liljestrom_2.jpg

"Internet sex groomer gets 15 months jail" (16-12-2009) A former soldier who used the internet to sexually groom a person he believed to be a 14-year-old schoolgirl has been jailed for at least 15 months. Evan Lindsay, 41, of Newtown in Sydney's inner west, had pleaded guilty to using a carriage service with the intent of procuring an underage girl to engage in sexual activities. In sentencing him in the NSW District Court on Wednesday, Judge Paul Lakatos said he took into account that the initial internet contact on September 8 last year was made by an undercover police officer posing as a 14-year-old girl. But he noted it was Lindsay who first brought up sexual matters in the conversations. The contact culminated in Lindsay's arrest on November 20 last year, when he went to a Parramatta carpark, with $300 in his wallet, intending to meet the "teenager". In his internet conversations, Lindsay had offered her "from $100 to $500 depending on the nature of the acts she was willing to perform", the judge said. In one conversation, Lindsay had written of his concern about "getting into trouble because of her age", the judge said. Lindsay joined the army in 1991, was promoted to sergeant and served in Bougainville. At the time of the offence, he was an employment service general manager. "I accept, based on what I have read and heard, that he is genuinely remorseful for what he has done," the judge said. He also accepted the opinions of experts who assessed Lindsay as posing a low risk of reoffending. He set a maximum term of two years six months, to date from when Lindsay first went into custody in November last year. He will be eligible for release on parole in February, when he is to be placed on a two-year good behaviour bond. http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/internet-sex-groomer-gets-15-months-jail-20091216-kw4m.html http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-12-07/internet-child-sex-groomer-was-depressed/1171744
PHILLIP GORDON LINDSAY (Phillip Lindsay) (SA - Adelaide)|52 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in May 2013 to 22yrs jail/ 13yrs non parole. - Found guilty in the South Australian Supreme Court in Nov, 2012.|Phillip Gordon Lindsay - Rapist - 21 charges including 5 counts of burglary and 12 of rape.. found guilty over home invasions in which he bound, blindfolded and raped women at knifepoint, in the northern and southern suburbs of Adelaide, between 1990 and 1993.. "Sick serial rapist Philip Gordon Lindsay pleads for leniency" (23-5-2013) Convicted rapist Phillip Gordon Lindsay only has a 40 per cent chance of surviving his jail term if he receives a four-year sentence, the Supreme Court has heard. Lindsay, 52, violently raped five women at knifepoint in their homes in the 1990s and was arrested nearly 20 years later based on DNA evidence. He was charged with 12 counts of rape, five counts of burglary, one count of false imprisonment and one count of using a motor vehicle without consent. He was convicted by a jury in November and is appealing his conviction. Today, Lindsay's lawyer, Paul Charman, told the court his client has emphysema and had only a 40 per cent chance of being alive in May 2017. Mr Charman asked Justice Timothy Stanley to take into account Lindsay's rehabilitation since a previous term of imprisonment and his illness. "Every year he does serve will be a significant proportion of the rest of his life," he said. Mr Charman said his client's condition had "deteriorated significantly" since sharing a cell with two smokers. "It would be a brave fellow indeed who asked two inmates to stop smoking," he said. Mr Charman said Lindsay had made significant changes to his life since 2000 when he was in jail for other offences. "From 2000 on there's been a significant change in Mr Lindsay's attitude and his level of offending", he said. "(He's) not necessarily the same person that committed these offences." Mr Charman said there was no question that the current charges were serious and that the women had suffered. He said his client was a drug user at the time of the offences and does not remember committing the horrific crimes. "If he did it, then he is horrified," Mr Charman said. "He genuinely does not remember what was happening at that point in his life ... if he did this then it was horrific and he is very remorseful. Frankly, he doesn't understand how he committed them." Prosecutor Sandi McDonald told the court Mr Lindsay's mentions of remorse and contrition were "hollow and meaningless" in light of the fact that he is appealing the conviction. Ms McDonald also said that his behaviour for the past decade should not be seen as a period of rehabilitation. "This man has had the benefit of most of his life at large," she said. Justice Stanley will sentence Lindsay next Friday. .

Police found 116 child exploitation videos on Aaron James Lowe's laptop. The Supreme Court in Hobart heard the 41-year-old had downloaded them between April and May of 2009. They included images of graphic sex acts by adults on children. Justice Helen Wood said the fact that Lowe tried to delete them by placing them in the computer's recycle bin that June weighed in his favour. The court heard Lowe had lost his job as a stevedore after he was charged and that his relationship at the time had also ended as a result. Lowe will be eligible for parole after six months and his name has been added to a register of sex offenders. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-04/20111104-man-jailed-over-distressing-child-porn/3626802

ANDREW JAMES LUCAS (TAS)|yrs old|Sentenced to 3 yrs jail - Lucas was granted parole in 2008 after serving half of his 3 yr sentence.|Andrew James Lucas- Convicted of rape and indecent assault in 2007. "Rapist paroled without treatment" (1-10-2008) A paroled rapist is the latest not to undertake a jail treatment program "through no fault of his own" and has instead been forced to get his own counselling following release from prison. Andrew James Lucas, who was convicted of rape and indecent assault in 2007, was recently granted parole after serving half of his three-year sentence. Lucas will now seek counselling in the community "because of this lack of opportunity". A Parole Board report says Lucas wanted to get rehabilitation for his criminal behaviour but was knocked back. "The board has further considered a report from the Sexual Offenders Treatment Program that assesses the applicant as being identified in the low to moderate range of risk of future offending," the September report says. "It is noted the applicant sought to enter the program but through no fault of his own was not included. "The applicant agrees to a psychological assessment once released and will pursue counselling in the community because of this lack of opportunity." Lucas is not the first sex offender to be denied access to the program despite wanting to participate. Also, sex offenders, including child predators, are refusing to do the program, making them ineligible. North-West sex predator Paul Ronald Goldsmith refused to participate, according to an ex-Risdon inmate. Goldsmith was jailed for six-and-a-half years in November 2006. He had pleaded guilty to 36 counts of indecent assault, four counts of maintaining a sexual relationship with a person under 17, one count of aggravated sexual assault and one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a young person. The Liberal Opposition targeted the government last week at Burnie's regional sitting of parliament to adopt mandatory sex offender treatment programs in jail.

In December 2010, Lucas was arrested after NT Police received information from the SA Police as part of Operation Decimate  which targets paedophiles using cutting-edge tracking technology -below. "DIY pornographer jailed for serious crimes" (19-3-2013) An educator has been jailed for superimposing the face of a seven-year-old schoolgirl on to photos of naked women and children in sex positions while he worked for NT Catholic Education. Mark Daniel Lucas  who retired as Catholic Educations curriculum officer late last year  will spend the next four weeks in prison. He has also been ordered to stay away from children under 16 for the next two years. The father-of-two pleaded guilty in the NT Supreme Court to possessing 455 child pornography images, most of which depicted children in erotic positions. But 40 images were category four  or show sexual activity between children and adults. In December 2010, Lucas was arrested after NT Police received information from the SA Police as part of Operation Decimate  which targets paedophiles using cutting-edge tracking technology. The court was told that Lucas, 64, had been superimposing the face of a seven-year-old schoolgirl on to the bodies of naked women and children in sexual positions for about a year. He got the photo of the girl from a work colleague. Lucas, who has been in the education field for 40 years, had been downloading child porn between November 2007 and August 2009. Justice Graham Hiley said: These are serious crimes. He said Lucas had stopped engaging in this unsavoury and criminal activity because he had deleted the images prior to his arrest. It is unlikely he will re-offend, he said. Justice Hiley said a psychological report found Lucas, who has also worked as an education officer for Indigenous Catholic Community Schools, did not have a propensity to break the law. (But) you cannot recall any specific triggeredyour interest in prepubescent girls in provocative poses, he said. Justice Hiley imposed a head sentence of 12 months suspended after four weeks. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2013/03/19/318679_ntnews.html

News (17-8-2012)- "Man avoids jail for disabled woman assault" A carer who forced his hand down the shirt of an intellectually disabled woman at a Melbourne residential facility has avoided jail. Ting Luey, 64, was sentenced to five months' jail, suspended for 12 months, in the Victorian County Court on Friday after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting the woman after she declined his advances. Judge Michael Bourke said the assault occurred late at night in October 2010, once the other residents had gone to bed after Luey had accompanied them to a disco. Luey, a relief carer at the residential facility for disabled people in Melbourne's east, had been watching television alone with the victim when he asked her to undo her bra. When she refused, he put his hand down her shirt. The victim told him to leave her alone and went to bed, but reported the incident the next morning. Luey initially denied any wrongdoing but pleaded guilty this week before his trial began. Since the incident his victim had become anxious, less trusting, fearful of change and nervous when left alone, the court heard. She wanted an apology from her attacker. Judge Bourke said Luey's claim that he had been fatigued after working a long shift was "clearly not a good moral or logical explanation". "This was an offence which was committed upon a vulnerable person within her home and within a setting which was supposed to protect her," he said. "Others must know that vulnerable persons such as (the victim) must be and feel protected from offending such as this." Judge Bourke said Luey was a man of previous good character who was ashamed and remorseful for what he had done. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/national/man-avoids-jail-for-disabled-woman-assault/story-e6frfku9-1226452570718#ixzz24EJbdSst|/images/paul_luckman.jpg

GERARD DONEHUE LYONS (VIC- Geelong/ Corio)|31 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Gerard Lyons. REGISTERED sex offender - placed on the Sex Offender's Register for life in 2006. News (17-2-2012)- "Report breach claims" A registered sex offender, residing in Geelong, has been released on bail after allegedly breaching his reporting conditions. Detective Senior Constable Paul Michell told Geelong Magistrates' Court yesterday that Gerard Donehue Lyons, 31, of Corio, had failed to notify police of his change of address, phone number and employment in accordance with his requirements under the Sex Offenders' Register. Lyons is also charged with unlicensed driving, exceeding .05 and failing to appear. Sen-Constable Michell said Lyons had extensive criminal and driving histories and the latest offending would breach two suspended jail sentences. "He is currently employed as a 'truck jockey' with a major furniture retailer in Geelong," the officer said. Sen-Constable Michell said Lyons was placed on the Sex Offender's Register for life in 2006 and has two prior breaches of conditions in 2006 and 2007. Michael Brugman, for Lyons, said his client was in the throes of a violent relationship when the driving offences occurred. He said Lyons' failure to appear might have something to do with the fact his past five court appearances had resulted in jail. Mr Brugman said his client was now employed and had stable accommodation with his brother. Lyons will reappear in Geelong Magistrates' Court on a date to be fixed. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2012/02/17/308261_news.html

Victims were 7 teenage girls aged between 13-16 yrs. Prior sex offences against girls as young as 12 yrs. One man shouting rot in hell you arsehole as Macfie was escorted out of the courtroom. -below- News (3-6-2011)- A former Portland man convicted of committing a six-week campaign of sexual abuse against seven teenage girls in the Ballarat region will spend the next decade behind bars. John William Macfie, 70, was sentenced in the County Court in Ballarat yesterday, and will serve up to 15 years and seven months in prison with a non-parole period of 11 years. A jury on Tuesday found Macfie guilty of 42 out of 52 charges. Sitting in the dock at the back of the court yesterday, Macfie remained unmoved when Judge Ross Howie delivered his sentence. A number of victims and their parents attended the sentencing, with one man shouting rot in hell you arsehole as Macfie was escorted out of the courtroom. The rest sat facing forwards, choosing not to take one last look at the man who devastated their lives. The court heard Macfie was already a convicted sex offender who had previously served 10 years in prison after two similar series of sexual offences involving girls as young as 12. In April and May last year he sexually abused seven girls aged between 13 and 16, who all went to a secondary college in the Ballarat region. Judge Howie summarised Macfies offending, telling the court he had preyed upon needy and vulnerable girls, and used a fictitious and bizarre story about becoming members of a secret mafia to trick them into performing sexual acts with him. He said Macfie had bribed the girls with promises of money and gifts including iPhones, cigarettes, fake identification, drugs and alcohol. Judge Howie said Macfie had told the girls about becoming princesses and warned them not to tell anyone about his crimes because they were being followed. Macfie warned one girl she would be killed if she told the police. Judge Howie said Macfie welcomed new girls with hugs, kisses and packages of goods, and persuaded two girls to stay overnight in his home. The court heard the six-week ordeal ended on May 18 last year when a school principal contacted police after making enquiries about the girls absences. When delivering his sentence, Judge Howie said the main purpose of his decision was to protect the community, and that Macfies history of offending and foolish conduct in court suggested he had no idea of the harm he had caused to the victims and their families. You showed a complete lack of remorse for your crimes, Judge Howie said. http://www.standard.net.au/news/local/news/general/exportland-paedophile-jailed-for-15-years/2183719.aspx|/images/sketch_john_macfie_2.jpg

CRAIG ADAM MAGEE (QLD- Brisbane)|56 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in April 2012, in the Brisbane District Court,to 22 months jail - to be released, on a good behaviour recognisance, after spending 5 months in custody.|Pleaded guilty in the Brisbane District Court to 38 charges. Caught in possession of 1000's of images of child pornography- majority of the images and videos involved girls aged as young as eight. News (19-4-2012)- "Army cadets volunteer Craig Adam Magee jailed for possessing child pornography"- A veteran army cadets volunteer was a blue card holder when he was caught in possession of thousands of images of child pornography which he had downloaded and shared via the internet, a court has been told. Craig Magee was on Wednesday jailed for 22-months after pleading guilty in the Brisbane District Court to 38 charges - including using the internet to download child porn, possessing it or making it available to other users over an eight month period. Commonwealth prosecutor David Kent revealed the 56-year-old grandfather was found in possession of 2731 images or videos of child pornography on his personal computer - along with a further 155,487 films or pictures of explicit adult porn. Mr Kent said Magee, then aged 54, used his computer to download child pornography on 36 occasions and once to make it available using the "Limewire" peer-to-peer file sharing program between January and September 2009. The court was told Magee, a motor vehicle spare parts "translator", had been the holder of a blue card - a Queensland Government run prevention and monitoring system for people working with children and young people - at the time of his arrest. Mr Kent said Magee had been involved in training army cadets, but had ceased since being charged by police. Barrister Martin van der Walt, for Magee, said his client had been a cadet volunteer for 14-years, but had worked in an area responsible for supplying uniforms to young cadets. Magee, the court was told, used computer search terms traditionally used by people trying to locate "pre-teen hardcore" child pornography. Mr Kent said that of the more than 2700 pornographic images or movies, over 200 of them depicted children engaged in actual sex acts with adult males or bondage situations. He said the vast majority of the images and videos involved girls aged as young as eight. The court was told Magee made full admissions to police when he was arrested and his computer seized. Mr van der Walt said his client made "extensive admissions" to police, including the "enormous amount of adult pornography" that Magee had downloaded. "The fact is ... (the child pornography) was on the computer," he said. Judge Milton Griffin, SC, in sentencing, told Magee it was likely and right that Magee would by humiliated and shamed by his actions, "which is simply a function of this disgusting behaviour." Judge Griffin ordered Magee be released, on a good behaviour recognisance, after having spent five months in actual custody. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/army-cadets-volunteer-craig-adam-magee-jailed-for-possessing-child-pornography/story-e6freoof-1226333109460

ROBINSON PETER MALCA-OBANDO (WA- Perth)|32 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 6-10-2011, in the Perth District court, to 24-months jail - suspended for 24 months- Must abide by program and supervision requirements.|Robinson Peter Malca-Obando. Pleaded guilty to 3 charges of indecent dealings with a child under 13 yrs old. Mentally ill man avoids jail for indecent dealings (6-10-2011)- A mentally ill man who pinched two schoolgirls on the bottom as they played sport and lifted up another girl's skirt has avoided jail in the Perth District court today. Robinson Peter Malca-Obando, 31, of Perth, pleaded guilty to three charges of indecent dealings with a child under 13-years-old. The Perth District court was told today Malca-Obando, who was born in Peru, pinched the two schoolgirls, aged nine and 10, on the bottom as they played sport with classmates at Birdwood Square on July 23 last year. The court was told Malca-Obando was chased away from the scene by a teacher and was later apprehended by police. The court heard while Malca-Obando was on bail for this offence, he lifted up the skirt of a five-year-old girl at the Morley Galleria Shopping Centre in December last year. The court was told Malca-Obando followed the girl and her nanny in the Target store before lifting up the girls skirt to expose her underwear. The incident was captured on the shopping centres CCTV footage, the court was told. In court today, Malca-Obando avoided jail and was handed a 24-month prison sentence suspended for 24 months, on condition that he abide by program and supervision requirements. Mr Malca-Obandos lawyer Marc Saupin told Judge Christopher Stevenson his client had stopped taking his medication for his mental illness at the time of both offences. The court was told Malca-Obando had been diagnosed with having a mild case of mental retardation and bipolar defective disorder. Mr Saupin conceded the offences committed by his client were every parents worst nightmare but that he had shown a remarkable improvement in the past six to eight weeks. He said if Malca-Obando were sent to prison, it would undo those improvements. He has offended in the most heinous of ways, Mr Saupin said. Hed come out of prison and be left to his own devices (if he were jailed). Judge Stevenson described Malca-Obandos offending as predatory which would have caused extreme concern to the parents of the victims, the teachers who witnessed the Highgate incident and the five-year-old girls nanny. The offending was predatory and opportunisticwhich the community will not tolerate, Judge Stevenson said. The consequences of your behaviour have far reaching effects beyond the victims themselves. Judge Stevenson noted Malca-Obando had had a difficult childhood and that his mild mental illness had affected his ability to integrate properly in the community. But all of these things Mr Malca-Obando are no excuses to commit offences of this type, he said. Judge Stevenson noted Malca-Obando had already spent several months in custody and that he had a strong family support network who wished to help him in the future. In handing down the 24-month suspended prison term, Judge Stevenson urged Malca-Obando to abide by any supervision and program requirements in the near future and to begin re-taking his medication. It remains the fact that if you fail to take your medicationyou will commit these type of offences, he said. Mr Saupin told the court his client was willing to take his medication via a monthly injection that could be administered at his home. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/mentally-ill-man-avoids-jail-for-indecent-dealings/story-e6frg153-1226160464337

Pleaded guilty in August- 2009 to 9 charges, including rape and sexual assault. News (26-2-2010)- "10 years on, South Bank rapist jailed"- A man who raped a 15-year-old girl more than 10 years ago will spend almost a decade in jail over the attack and other offences. Savelo Mamea, 35, was not arrested for the 1999 rape on Brisbane's South Bank until 2007 when police matched his DNA to swabs taken from his teenage victim, the Brisbane District Court was told today. Prosecutor Vicki Loury said Mamea initially denied having sex with the girl but later told police it was consensual. The court was told he dragged the girl into a part of South Bank that was still under construction and raped her as she cried and begged him to let her go. After he left, the girl caught a train to a friend's place and reported the attack to police. Mamea was charged in September 2007 and released on bail, which he was still on when he committed a string of other offences between May 2008 and January last year. The court was told the least serious were stealing offences from supermarkets and chemists, while the worst involved his participation in a group home invasion where a man was severely beaten with a baseball bat. Mamea pleaded guilty in August last year to nine charges, including rape, sexual assault, assault occasioning bodily harm while armed and in company, stealing and burglary. His application to withdraw his pleas of guilty was rejected late last year, and he was sentenced on Friday to a total of nine-and-a-half-years' jail. Mamea, who has already served 286 days in pre-sentence custody, will be eligible for parole in August 2014. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/10-years-on-south-bank-rapist-jailed-20100226-p8rq.html

ANSON DANIEL MANNING (Anson Manning) (VIC- Bendigo)|27 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in Nov - 2012, in the Bendigo County Court, to 12 yrs jail - 9 yrs non parole.|Anson Daniel Manning - Pleaded guilty to counts of persistent sexual abuse of a child under 16, producing child pornography and possessing child pornography. Man jailed for sexually abusing 12 yo (19-11-2012) A 27-year-old Bendigo man has been sentenced to 12 years' jail over the sexual abuse of a boy. Anson Daniel Manning pleaded guilty in the County Court last month to five charges for offences between 2007 and 2011. During that time, Manning used the boy to make child pornography. Judge Lance Pilgrim said police found close to 10,500 illegal images and videos on Manning's computer, including hundreds featuring the boy. The victim's family cried as the details were read out. Judge Pilgrim described Manning as a disgrace. The former aged care worker has been put on the sex offenders' register for life and will be eligible for parole after serving nine years in prison. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-19/man-jailed-for-sexually-abusing-12yo/4379636 http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-16/bendigo-man-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-charges/4315044 Bendigo man filmed sex acts with boy (16-10-2012) A Bendigo man has pleaded guilty to filming and photographing sexual acts with a young boy while coercing him with gifts during a four-year period. Anson Daniel Manning, 27, is charged with persistent sexual abuse of the boy between 2007 and 2012, starting when the child was just nine years old. Federal police found 412 sexually explicit photos and 31 pornographic videos of the boy when they raided Mannings Bendigo home in January this year. They also uncovered 466 other videos and 10,126 other images of child pornography. Manning faced the Victorian County Court in Bendigo yesterday to enter pleas of guilty to counts of persistent sexual abuse of a child under 16, producing child pornography and possessing child pornography. Prosecutor Peter Jones said the boy had been in Mannings care when the offending took place. He read to the court a long list of the sexual abuse the young child suffered at the hands of Manning including numerous incidents of sexual penetration. The court heard Manning had offered the boy gifts including an iPod and a scooter in exchange for the sexual acts. Mr Jones said the boy became depressed and angry but was too scared to tell anyone about the abuse. He said the offending was only discovered by the federal police late last year, as part of a wider child pornography operation. He said police found Manning was uploading child pornography on peer to peer file sharing service GigaTribe. Members of the gallery became very emotional throughout the hour-long prosecution summary. At one point the childs mother ran from the court sobbing, briefly turning to Manning to call him a sick f-. Manning, an overweight man with long greasy hair, stayed hunched over in the dock. He covered his face with his hands for most of the proceedings. Mr Jones told Judge Lance Pilgrim the court was seeking a 10 to 12-year head sentence with a non-parole period on seven to nine years. A conviction will mean Manning is categorised as a serious sexual offender and will be placed on the sex offenders register for life. Mannings defence counsel Stephen Payne said his client was remorseful and ashamed of his actions. The plea will resume in the same court this morning. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/399534/bendigo-man-filmed-sex-acts-with-boy/
NEVILLE MANSFIELD (VIC - Shepparton)|52 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in the Victorian County Court, to 16 years jail - 12 yrs non parole. Sentence was reduced on appeal (25-6-2013), to 14yrs jail/ 11yrs non-parole.|Neville Mansfield - Convicted Rapist. "Rapist has jail sentence reduced" (25-6-2013) A man arrested 14 years after his DNA was linked to a terrifying home invasion where a young mother was repeatedly raped and her two children and an elderly babysitter threatened has today had his jail sentence reduced by the Court of Appeal. Neville Mansfield, 52, was jailed last year for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years after a County Court jury found him guilty of five counts of rape, four of false imprisonment, three of making a threat to kill and one each of indecent assault and aggravated burglary. But Court of Appeal Justices Peter Buchanan, David Ashley and Paul Coghlan decided to recalculate his total jail sentence after finding the sentences imposed on the rape charges were inadequate but the sentences for the threat to kill charges were excessive. The three judges dismissed Mansfield's application seeking leave to appeal his conviction but reduced his jail sentence to 14 years with a non-parole period of 11 years. Justice Buchanan said it was early in the morning of April 7, 1993, when an intruder entered a house in Shepparton. The intruder was heavily disguised, wearing a tea towel over his face. A 37-year-old mother, her daughter, 11, and son, 6, and a babysitter, 69, were inside the house at the time. After entering the house, the intruder grabbed the son in a headlock and held a knife to his throat before telling the mother: "Do as you are told or he will be hurt. I will slit his throat." The mother managed to persuade the intruder to release her son and he then demanded money, which the mother and the babysitter handed over. The intruder ordered the family and the babysitter into the master bedroom where he told them to sit on the bed together and tell him their names. He then bound and gagged them. When the babysitter complained about how tightly the intruder had tied her hands together, the intruder told the mother, "Tell grandma to shut up," before asking the babysitter: "What is better, having your hands tied or having your throat slit?" When the mother pleaded with the intruder not to gag her son, the intruder replied: "Would you rather this or for me to slit his throat?" The intruder then dragged the mother into the kitchen and ran the knife across her stomach and throat and said: "Feel how sharp it is, I could kill you with this." The intruder then repeatedly raped the mother. He later washed the mother and the floor afterwards to try to remove traces of his DNA. Justice Buchanan said that during the police investigation, a sperm fragment containing DNA was recovered and later found to match Mansfield's DNA after his arrest in Queensland on other charges in 2007. Mansfield wanted to appeal his conviction and sentence, claiming he could not be convicted on the DNA evidence alone, but the judges said there was other evidence proving he was the intruder, including the fact he was seen in Shepparton at the time and he matched the description of the suspect. http://www.mailtimes.com.au/story/1596135/rapist-has-jail-sentence-reduced/ "Vic rapist appeals against conviction" (28-5-2013) A man who bound, gagged and blindfolded a six-year-old boy before raping his mother in a home invasion is appealing his conviction and sentence in Victoria's highest court. Neville Mansfield, 52, entered the woman's Shepparton home in 1993 through an unlocked door and held a knife to her son's throat. He tied the hands of the boy, his 11-year-old sister and their elderly babysitter, put socks in their mouths and pillowcases over their heads before raping their mother in another room and threatening to kill them all. He became a suspect 14 years later, after having to provide a DNA sample for another matter. A Victorian County Court jury heard DNA taken from the home was over 14 trillion times more likely to be Mansfield's than anyone else's. In the Victorian Court of Appeal on Tuesday, Mansfield's lawyer Dermot Dann said the jury was not properly instructed on how to deal with the DNA evidence and factors that could affect the likelihood it belonged to Mansfield. He said Mansfield's sentence of 16 years with a minimum of 12 years should be slashed because it was excessive and did not take into account the fact that Aboriginal men had an average life expectancy of 67. "Each year of the sentence does represent a significant proportion of this man's remaining life," he said. Crown prosecutor Tom Gyorffy SC said the judge had made it "absolutely plain" to the jury what they had to consider in dealing with the DNA evidence. He said the case against Mansfield was strong and the jury had been aware that there had been other suspects who had been eliminated. "This was a very comprehensive investigation. It's not just a case of saying this man is it," Mr Gyorffy said. He said the overall sentence was appropriate for what was a very serious offence. The appeal court judges reserved their decision. http://au.news.yahoo.com/latest/a/-/latest/17359727/vic-rapist-appeals-against-conviction/

Pleaded guilty to 3 charges of using the internet to access and transmit child pornography between 2006 and 2009, and 1 charge of recording an indecent visual image of a child under the age of 16 between December 2007 and February 2008. The Townsville - based key member of an international computer paedophile group, former postal worker Derek Richard Mara, has been jailed for six years. The Commonwealth prosecutor had asked for four-and-a-half years, but in a rare move, Judge Stuart Durward SC decided that that wasn't enough for a man he described as having `a cruel, unnatural and disgusting perversion'. Mara, 30, pleaded guilty to three counts of sending and receiving paedophile images after he was scooped up in a coordinated international crackdown on the group trading in hard-core child images and movies through a high-security computer system. Mara was one of the four core members of the operation, known simply as The Group, who in 2004 helped set up sophisticated security systems using uncrackable encrypted codes to avoid detection. .|/images/derek_mara_2.jpg
PETER MARAMA (QLD- Brisbane)|yrs old|To be updated.|Torres Strait Islander - Has a history of rape and assault offences,including a conviction for attempted rape of a 3 yr old girl. News (27-1-2012)- "Convicted rapist could walk free"- MORE than 100 sex offenders have come before the courts under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual) Offenders Act, which was originally designed to cater for about a dozen offenders, a court has been told. The revelations came to light in a court judgment where a convicted rapist was applying for release until a full hearing of an alleged breach of his supervision order could be heard. In the Supreme Court in Brisbane, Justice Peter Applegarth noted Peter Marama would spend eight months in jail waiting for a court date to hear his case. Justice Applegarth said Marama, who was returned to jail last September, would be seen by psychiatrists next month but his hearing wasn't listed until May. "That is because of a number of matters. One is limited judicial resources. When this Act was passed, the Attorney-General, in introducing it, anticipated that there would only be a dozen or so offenders subjected to it at any one time. "As it happens, there are well in excess of 100 and the number grows every year. There is limited judicial time available to conduct the regular hearings that have to be held in relation to continuing detention orders, and other hearings," he said. Justice Applegarth considered under the circumstances of the breach and the delay, Marama should be released under a continuing supervision order until his hearing. In 2009, Marama was released from jail on a strict supervision order with 41 restrictions which were breached last year and he returned to jail. Marama was brought back before the Supreme Court to show why he should not remain indefinitely in jail and has been held in custody since. The court heard Marama had been in jail since 2003 on his latest convictions and had a history of rape and assault offences. He also had a conviction for attempted rape of a three-year-old girl. Justice Applegarth noted Marama was a Torres Strait Islander with poor English and intellectual deficits, poor literacy and numeracy skills. He said Marama's situation was normally linked to alcohol abuse and psychiatrists were concerned he might reoffend. "But he comes before the court because of a series of unfortunate events and his deliberate failure to disclose a relationship which he developed with a woman for fear that by making disclosure he would be returned to custody," Justice Applegarth said. The judge said Marama thought he had breached the order by talking to the woman at a shopping centre but he his supervision order did not stop him from doing so. http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/convicted-rapist-could-walk-as-court-struggles-to-cope/story-fn6ck45n-1226254669177

Victim was a young Aboriginal woman. Co-offenders - Davin Roy Butler and Julian Marc Lawton . News (11-2-2011)- "Trio sentenced for gang rape"- Three men found guilty of the pack rape of a young Aboriginal woman have each been sentenced in the Rockhampton District Court today to between seven and eight-and-a-half years in prison. Judge Grant Britton delivered his judgment after hearing submissions from Crown Prosecutor Joshua Phillips and defence lawyers yesterday. A jury took four hours to come to a verdict which found Joshua Peter Marshall, 20, Davin Roy Butler, 23, and Julian Marc Lawton, 25, each guilty of two counts of rape and one of attempted rape. During the trial the court heard that Butler and Marshall had sex with the woman without her consent at a park near the South Rockhampton Memorial Pool on December 14, 2007. Lawton was also guilty of rape because he aided and assisted the other two by his presence and also the violence he showed towards the complainant. Judge Britton sentenced Lawton to seven years in prison to reflect his lesser involvement while Marshall was sentenced to eight years and Butler eight-and-a-half years. EARLIER: THREE men have been found guilty of a brutal gang rape of a young Aboriginal woman in a Rockhampton park more than three years ago. A jury deliberated for more than four hours before finding Davin Roy Butler, 23, Joshua Peter Marshall, 20, and Julian Marc Lawton, 25, each guilty of two counts of rape and one off attempted rape yesterday afternoon. Family members of the convicted rapists wept in the public gallery after the verdicts were read out. Judge Grant Britton after hearing submissions from Crown Prosecutor Joshua Phillips and defence lawyers for the trio adjourned the court and will deliver his sentence this morning. Mr Phillips asked for a sentence of between eight and nine years for each man. During the trial the court heard that the men had sex with the woman without her consent at a park near the South Rockhampton Memorial Pool on December 14, 2007. Mr Phillips told the court Marshall and Butler had taken turns to rape her while Lawton was also responsible because of the words uttered and the violence he had displayed towards her. He told jurors the case stands and falls on their assessment of her credibility. In a statement the complainant said she was raped by Marshall while the other two men held her down and hit her repeatedly. She said Butler then attempted to orally rape her but she bit him on the penis. Butler then raped the woman while the other two held her down again. Ross Lo Monaco, appearing for Lawton, said because his client did not physically take part in the acts of rape his sentence should be significantly discounted. He finds himself in this mess because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He had also not taken advantage of the situation for his own sexual gratification. Jeff Clarke, who represented Marshall, said his client was just 17-years-old at the time of the incident. He was illiterate and educated to a grade eight level. He asked for a reduced penalty because of his young age at the time and lack of criminal history. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/story/2011/02/11/trio-guilty-of-gang-rape-butler-marshall-lawton/

Cowaramup man Paul Ian Marshall was sentenced earlier this year to four years imprisonment for indecent behaviour. Mr Grono said education was an important tool and parents needed to feel they could speak with their children freely, knowing people they can trust to confide in if something is wrong.

PETER JOHN MARSHALL aka Peter John Leith (SA- Eastwood)|58 yrs old (2012)|9-2-2012- Judge Bampton remanded Peter Marshall on continuing bail for further submissions next month (March 2012).. Sentenced in March 2012 to 12 yrs jail - 6 yrs non parole.|Found guilty in July 2011, of 1 count of persistent sexual exploitation of a child, and 3 counts of buggery. Victims were boys aged 11-12 yrs old. Marshall had been jointly charged with former TV star and children's entertainer Ric Marshall . News (29-3-2012)- "Paedophile jailed for 12 yrs"- After four decades of secrecy and shame, paedophile Peter John Marshall has finally been jailed for his "devastating, insidious" crimes. The District Court today sentenced Marshall - aka Peter John Leith - to 12 years' jail, and ordered he serve a non-parole period of six years, for abusing three boys in the 1970s. The sentence brought one of Marshall's victims, who has waited 37 years to see his abuser face justice, to tears. "I'm not dissatisfied with the outcome, but I certainly think the court process is arduous," he said outside court. "For the last 30 years, successive South Australian governments made it impossible for the victims of sexual crime to file charges against their tormentors. "Those politicians should now be ashamed of themselves ... it was abominable, and there was absolutely no excuse for it." http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/paedophile-jailed-for-12-years/story-e6freono-1226313676640 News (9-3-2012)- "Paedophile Predator Gets Bail- http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/paedophile-predator-gets-bail/story-e6frea83-1226295404167 "Identity and case of paedophile Peter John Marshall can now be reported" (9-2-2012) After eight months of court-ordered secrecy, the paedophile convictions of a TV star's "informal son" can finally be revealed. Orders that banned AdelaideNow from reporting the case of Peter Marshall - aka Peter John Leith - were rescinded by the District Court this morning. In July last year Marshall, 58, of Eastwood, was found guilty of one count of persistent sexual exploitation of a child and three counts of buggery. He had been jointly charged with former TV star and children's entertainer Ric Marshall. Previously, the court was told Peter Marshall was "informally referred to" as Ric Marshall's son but there were "no legal proceedings formally endorsing that". Ric Marshall was a beloved Adelaide celebrity in the 1960s and 1970s, working extensively on television and with the now-notorious Cottage Theatre. The men were tried separately, however, because Ric Marshall was found to be mentally unfit to stand trial. The District Court has yet to determine whether he will be ordered to serve a limiting term. During Peter Marshall's trial - which was held in a closed court, with all evidence given subject to suppression orders - prosecutors alleged he offended against boys aged between 11 and 12 years. They claimed the offences occurred in Adelaide, Gilberton, Malvern and Renmark. One boy, they alleged, was persistently sexually abused between December 1971 and December 1974. Acts of buggery, they claimed, were committed between June and December 1974, and between March and September 1975. Prosecutors further alleged Peter Marshall's victims had already been groomed by his "father" at the time of his offences. Judge Anne Bampton - who heard the trial in the absence of a jury - found Peter Marshall guilty on June 10 last year. She then suppressed both her guilty verdict and her written reasons from publication. Today Libby Griffith, prosecuting, said Peter Marshall had committed serious crimes against vulnerable children. "His offending resulted in a great deal of shame and misery for the victims," she said. "It has adversely affected many aspects of the rest of their lives." She said Marshall - who faces a maximum life-sentence - deserved little mercy. "There has been no acknowledgment of guilt in any way nor, in any way whatsoever, evidence of contrition or remorse," she said. "There is no evidence before this court of any sort of rehabilitation... consequently, there is no mitigation available." Ms Griffith said any claims Peter Marshall may make about being a victim himself held little weight. "The mere fact an offender was a victim of sexual abuse should serve to bring home the terrible consequences for their own victims," she said. Judge Bampton remanded Peter Marshall on continuing bail for further submissions next month. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/identity-and-case-of-paedophile-peter-john-marshall-can-now-be-reported/story-e6frea83-1226266638345|/images/peter_john_marshall_2.jpg

DAVID PETER MARSTERS (New Zealand- believed to be moving to the QLD- Gold Coast , Australia in June 2011)|37 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced to 13 yrs 6 mths in April 2001.|Multiple rape and paedophilia offences. The Dominion (9-8-2001)- An appeal against a thirteen and-a-half year jail term for a man dubbed a sexual predator and serial paedophile has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal. David Peter Marsters was jailed on April 30 for rape, sexual violation, indecent assault - 12 sexual offences committed against four victims - and burglary. He appealed against both convictions and sentence. Judges said that given the nature and extent of the offending, a thirteen and-a-half year imprisonment term for an offender who put members of the public at risk was a lenient or minimal sentence. Lawyer Mary Tuilotolava argued that the sexual offences and the burglary charges should have been heard separately, an eleven and-a-half year sentence for the rape of a toddler was too severe, and imposing a cumulative sentence for the burglary and sex charges was unduly harsh. These arguments were dismissed by the Court of Appeal as unimpressive and unsubstantiated. Sensible Sentencing Trust-NZ|/images/david_marsters.jpg
JEREMY SCOTT MARTIN (Jeremy Martin) (QLD)|24 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced 4-12-2013, in the Brisbane District Court, to 3.5 yrs jail - granted immediate release, after Judge Julie Ryrie ordered Martin's sentence be suspended immediately, after noting the now convicted sex offender had already spent 13 months in pre-sentence custody..Martin received an additional three years' probation and ordered to undergo a sexual offenders course in the community.|Jeremy Scott Martin - Pleaded guilty to six charges, including recording in breach of privacy, assault with intent to rape, burglary and sexual assault while armed. "Would-be rapist wearing Scream mask jailed for 13 months, Attorney-General might appeal" (5-12-2013) An "obsessed" would-be rapist who broke into a woman's house wearing a Scream mask and armed with a "rape kit" has walked free after serving just 13 months' jail. But Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie said last night he had ordered a review of the case and would consider an appeal. Jeremy Scott Martin only agreed to stop the violent attack on his victim after she agreed to let him take naked photographs of her. The Brisbane District Court was yesterday told Martin was carrying a rape kit - complete with duct tape, blindfold and scissors - when he attacked a female acquaintance in her third-floor Indooroopilly apartment on October 25 last year. The court was told Martin scaled his victim's building and entered the unit via an open balcony door, before dressing in a black shirt, donning a Scream mask and demanding his victim have sex with him. Prosecutors said Martin became violent when his victim - who had just showered and was wearing only a towel - refused his request for sex, but then agreed to leave if she would pose naked for a photograph. Martin, now 24, was jailed for three-and-a-half years, but granted immediate release, after pleading guilty to six charges, including recording in breach of privacy, assault with intent to rape, burglary and sexual assault while armed. Judge Julie Ryrie ordered Martin's sentence be suspended immediately, after noting the now convicted sex offender had already spent 13 months in pre-sentence custody. Under existing Queensland laws, the maximum penalty for a person convicted of assault with intent to rape is 14 years, while aggravated burglary - which includes committing the offence while armed - can attract life imprisonment.

"Theatre worker jailed over 27,500 images of children" (15-9-2011) A former artistic contributor to the Commonwealth and Olympic Games, highly regarded for his work on many Melbourne theatrical events, has been jailed for more than three years for handling 27,500 items of child pornography. US-born Albert Joseph Martinez, 63, a sought-after puppet and props maker, pleaded guilty to charges of publishing or transmitting via the internet and possession of 26,837 child porn images and 702 videos, many depicting children younger than 10 and including some with the highest category of violent or abusive content. Martinez, who oversaw some artistic aspects of the Sydney Olympic and Melbourne Commonwealth Games, also worked with major ballet and theatrical companies and had taught for a number of years at the Victorian College of the Arts, the County Court heard. His involvement in sharing grotesque child pornography images came to police attention in Victoria after child exploitation experts in the US monitored his visits to known websites. Martinez told police he had become addicted to pornography, accessing it for up to six hours a day, and despite him finding some of the images abhorrent and the child victims distressed, he passed on the material to other offenders. In sentencing Martinez to three years and four months' jail, with a minimum of two years and three months, Judge Sue Pullen said he treated the children and the images "as a commodity to exchange". "You were creating a market to produce pornography." Judge Pullen said Martinez, who had worked on productions including The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, had expressed "shame and remorse" for his offending, now recognised it was not a victimless crime and said his reputation had suffered a "significant fall from grace". http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/olympics-worker-jailed-for-child-porn/story-fn7x8me2-1226137211004

McClumpha molested an 11 yr old girl in a hotel spa while on holiday in Darwin in Jan - 2007..Has Prior History. Suicidal paedophile walks free in NT (27-4-2007) A suicidal paedophile who molested a young girl in a hotel spa while on holiday in Darwin, has walked free after his two-year prison sentence was immediately suspended. Harry McClumpha sparked a missing person search in the Northern Territory following the incident involving an 11-year-old girl in January this year. The 70-year-old from Perth fled because he was ashamed of his actions and wanted to die, his lawyer Louise Bennett told Darwin Magistrates Court on Friday. Police found the known paedophile after six days on the run. He was disoriented and lying under bushes near the centre of the city. "He took himself off as he simply wanted to die and when police arrested him he was in a pretty terrible state, he was not expecting at that stage that his life would go on," Ms Bennett said. McClumpha, who sat with his hands clasped between his legs throughout the court proceedings, had travelled to the Top End with a family he had known for more than two years, the court heard. Magistrate Sue Oliver said he was treated by the young girl and her parents like a grandfather. "They had taken you into their hearts," she said. "You asked (the girl) for a cuddle, as well a grandfather might, and she came to you for that purpose ... "I am told you conceded your actions and said: 'I am a nasty old man'." Ms Bennett said McClumpha had twice tried to kill himself because he was ashamed of his paedophilia that had "destroyed" his life, including two failed marriages. "He has a fairly solitary, lonely sort of life," she said. "He says that what people need to realise is that people should be on (sex offending) programs for life." She said her client was "a frail, elderly man" who had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to one count of unlawful and indecent dealings with a child under 16. He had also shown remorse and served more than three months hard time in prison, requiring protection even from the other protected inmates. The magistrate sentenced McClumpha, who has been in custody since his arrest on January 11, to two years in prison, partially suspended. He could walk free from the court and return to WA provided he undergo a sex offenders course and report regularly to police. "You have a history of offending against young girls in this way," Ms Oliver said. "It is a sad history dating back to the age of 16 when you committed your first offence in 1953 ... "It is more sad, of course, that you have continued on this path for such a long time." http://news.smh.com.au/national/suicidal-paedophile-walks-free-in-nt-20070427-9tt.html

IAN ALEXANDER McCOOKE (Ian McCooke) (WA)|70 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in September - 2013, in the Perth's District Court, to 12 yrs jail - 10 yrs non parole.|Ian Alexander McCooke - Paedophile/ Former Primary School Teacher..Convicted on 13 charges of sexually abusing and raping two girls in Western Australia's Wheatbelt, the youngest of whom was just four years old. "WA teacher jailed for 12 years for raping girl, 8, on desk" (5-9-2013) A Former primary school teacher who raped one of his eight-year old students on a classroom desk has been jailed for 12 years. Ian Alexander McCooke, 70, will serve at least ten years in jail after being convicted on 13 charges of sexually abusing and raping two girls in Western Australia's Wheatbelt, the youngest of whom was just four. McCooke denied both sets of offences, which began in 1997 - despite being secretly recorded by one of the girls admitting to touching her ``below the waist''. An audibly emotional Judge John Staude said McCooke was one of the most cynical sex offenders he had ever encountered, saying he had utterly disgraced the teaching profession, and morally corrupted both of his victims. ``You put your sexual gratification above all other considerations,'' Judge Staude said in Perth's District Court. ``Both victims were groomed in order to get their cooperation and silence in a way that was particularly sinister.'' The two girls, who did not know each other, had both claimed McCooke groomed them with elevating levels of inappropriate touching before raping them. The youngest was just four when the alleged abuse began, the court was told. Prosecutor Brett Tooker said McCooke was a teacher at the Wheatbelt school from 1990, and in 1997 began taking a sexual interest in one of his Year 3 pupils. The victim, who is now 24, told police McCooke began his abuse by touching her over her clothes, then inside her underwear and eventually raped her in the pre-primary room of the school. He raped her again soon after on a desk in another classroom. The second girl alleged she was abused repeatedly in the back of McCooke's van and in his home between 2000 and 2002. McCooke, who has been married for 48 years, claimed to police that he had touched his younger second victim because she had asked him to. He had also attempted to blame another man as the abuser. Judge Staude described his claims as ``unspeakably dishonourable''. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/wa-teacher-jailed-for-raping-child-on-desk/story-fnhocxo3-1226711532501 "Teacher raped girl student, 8, on desk, prosecutor tells court" (26-8-2013) A teacher raped an eight-year-old female student on a desk in a West Australian primary school during years of increasingly serious sexual abuse, a court has been told. Alexander Ian McCook, 70, went on trial at Perth's District Court today charged with sexually abusing two girls between 1997 and 2002 while he was teacher at a primary school in the state's Wheatbelt region. The two girls, who did not know each other, both claim McCook groomed them with elevating levels of inappropriate touching before raping them. The youngest was just four when the alleged abuse of her began, the court was told. Prosecutor Brett Tooker said McCook was a teacher at the school from 1990, and in 1997 began taking a sexual interest in one of his Year 3 pupils. The victim, who is now 24, told police McCook began his abuse by touching her over her clothes, then inside her underwear and eventually raped her in the pre-primary room of the school. He raped her again soon after on a desk in a classroom. The second girl alleges she was abused repeatedly between 2000 and 2002. ``These are two women who share a common story - they are remarkable similar stories, although they are not related to each other and are not known to each other,'' Mr Tooker told the jury. The trial will be played a conversation the younger victim had with McCook which she secretly recorded on her phone, which the prosecution claim amounts to an admission. But defence lawyer Gary Rodgers said his client denied all 13 charges of indecent dealing with a child and sexual penetration of a child. The trial, before Justice John Staude, is set to last seven days. http://www.perthnow.com.au/national-news/western-australia/teacher-raped-student-on-desk-prosecutor-tells-court/story-fnii5thn-1226704412513#ixzz2d8kfCEgZ www.communityprotection.wa.gov.au/

"HIV victims tell court of 'betrayal'" (10-3-2011) Two men who were tricked into having unprotected sex with an HIV-positive man have told the South Australian Supreme Court they felt betrayed, embarrassed and depressed since. Stuart James McDonald was convicted of endangering the lives of two of his sexual partners and acquitted at trial of a further six counts. The court heard he deceived men and lied about his HIV status. In a statement read to the court, one victim said he felt betrayed by McDonald. "Prior to being diagnosed with HIV, I was outgoing, confident and had career ambitions," he told the court. "I still suffer from periods of depression and anxiety in public and this is something I am going to have to work on if I am ever going to get my life back on track." He said he had always taken responsibility for his sexual health and felt betrayed by McDonald's lies. "You of all people understand what I am going through. I am most hurt that you took advantage of the state I was in," he said. The other victim's statement said: "I have suffered terribly from stress and depression. "I now find it hard to socialise and be with other human beings and my day-to-day life has become complicated." He said he felt embarrassed, had suffered from loss of sleep and appetite and also had horrible side-effects from medication he was taking. Defence lawyers said the court could not be satisfied McDonald was the one who infected the men with HIV, but prosecutors disagreed. They said McDonald has taken no responsibility for his actions and could keep posing a danger to the community. Prosecutor Sandi McDonald said Stuart McDonald's statements about his HIV status had "an element of deceit and trickery". "The need to protect the community, that is a matter that should cause Your Honour some concern. "This is a man who still refuses to take responsibility for his actions. That does not go well in terms of his attitude towards the protection of other members of the community in the future." McDonald will be sentenced later. .|/images/stuart_mcdonald_2.jpg

Youth worker gave sex victim money- (5-2-2007) A Christian youth worker who had sex with a 13-year-old girl gave his victim money so that she would not go to the police. The County Court heard that Mark McGorum gave the girl $40 a week for four months and an extra $150 so she could visit her grandmother. Prosecutor Mark Gibson said McGorum, who was a youth leader at a church in Hoppers Crossing, had also bought the girl cigarettes, taken her to the movies and paid for her and her brother to attend church activities. "The accused stated that he was happy to give her this money so that the incidents were not reported to the police," Mr Gibson said. "The complainant's parents had trusted him with their children  he agreed that he had broken that trust." McGorum, 35, of Werribee, pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual penetration of a child under 16 between January 2002 and February 2003. Mr Gibson said the charges were "sanitised", with the victim, now 18, having alleged there were "many, many, many" other occurrences. The court heard she refused to testify about the further alleged incidents. Forensic psychologist Patrick Newton said McGorum had poor insight, showed little empathy for the victim and was at moderate risk of reoffending. Defence lawyer Leighton Gwynn said his client was remorseful. Mr Gibson said these types of cases were on the rise. "There needs to be  a clear message to the community, in particular people who are occupying positions of care, supervision or authority, that the courts won't tolerate this behaviour." Judge Jennifer Coate granted bail to McGorum until sentencing this month. He will be registered as a sex offender and must report for life. http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/youth-worker-gave-sex-victim-money/2007/02/04/1170523961009.html

News (15-11-2012)- "James Patrick McGrane, jailed over the rape and murder in 1986 of his sister, fails in bid for review of parole decision" A Darling Downs man who has spent all his adult life in jail for the rape and murder of his sister more than 25-years ago has lost his bid for court-ordered review of his parole. Brisbane Supreme Court judge David Boddice on Thursday dismissed James Patrick McGrane's attempt to force the Queensland State Parole Board to review its decision to refuse him release on parole. McGrane, 43, was 17 years-old when he pleaded guilty to the rape of his sister, 21, whose bound body was found at Hodgson Vale, 17 km south of Toowoomba, on the Darling Downs, on March 26, 1986. McGrane pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility but a Supreme Court jury found him guilty. He was subsequently sentencing to life imprisonment.

ANDREW DEAN McINTOSH (NSW)|53 yrs old (2011)|Found guilty 27-5-2011 in the NSW Supreme Court of child sex offences. Sentenced in August 2011 to 32yrs jail/ 20yrs non parole.|Victims were boys. "Paedophile given 32-year sentence" (23-8-2011)  As one of New South Wales's worst paedophiles, Andrew Dean McIntosh, was sentenced to at least 20 years' jail, Sascha Chandler leant forward in his seat and pointed directly at his former tormentor. Then, as the packed gallery in the NSW District Court cheered and broke into spontaneous applause, the young man's eyes filled with tears. ''It was a moment of triumph - a bit of an 'I told you so','' Mr Chandler said yesterday. ''We always wanted this case to be a beacon of hope for others and I think with the sentence he got, that's what happened.'' Justice Michael Finnane took the unusual step of singling Mr Chandler out for praise in his judgment, declaring that, without his determination and courage, the horrific acts McIntosh committed as a cadet master at Barker College on Sydney's North Shore ''would never had come to light''. As a 15-year-old in the early 1990s Mr Chandler was repeatedly raped, assaulted and flogged by McIntosh both at the offender's home and during cadet camps put on by Barker. He drew Chandler in and so ingratiated himself with the young man's parents that they frequently had him over for dinner and on one occasion invited him to join them on Christmas Day. Last year, McIntosh was found guilty of committing 24 offences against Mr Chandler alone. In May this year he was found guilty of a further 18 charges of buggery and indecent assault involving three boys as young as nine at Inverell, in far north NSW, between 1977 and 1983. He was sentenced to 32 years' jail with a non-parole period of 20 years. The court heard that McIntosh would befriend the boys, buying them drinks and cigarettes and inviting them to his property to ride BMX bikes and shoot rifles. He then brutally raped and assaulted them, flogging them with plastic canes and electrical cords and often threatening to ''blow up'' their families if they told anyone about the assaults committed against them. After watching a jury find McIntosh guilty last year, Mr Chandler took the unusual step of insisting that his name be published and of encouraging the media to publish photos of him and personal details. He is now working for a number of victim support organisations including Survivors Australia and undertook his first workshop for victims of sexual assault last week, an experience he described as ''pretty tormenting but totally worthwhile''. ''People are reaching out - you're going to see a groundswell of people coming forward and declare that they're victims of abuse,'' he said. McIntosh will be eligible for parole in December 2028, having already served 3 years of his sentence. http://www.theage.com.au/national/paedophile-given-32year-sentence-20110822-1j6p4.html "'Evil' NSW man convicted of child sex abuse" (27-5-2011) A man who flogged a boy with a kettle cord and feather duster has been found guilty of sexually abusing three boys in NSW in the 1980s. Andrew Dean McIntosh, 53, was convicted today of 18 offences, including buggery and indecent assault, between 1979 and 1984. Women and men, including one victim, wept in the public gallery as the jury returned its verdict in the NSW Supreme Court. During the trial, which began in April, the court was told McIntosh stalked and groomed his victims, and assaulted them sexually and physically. He befriended the boys' families to form relationships with them, the crown said. One victim who gave evidence at the trial said McIntosh threatened to blow up his family if he told anyone about the attacks. He said he had been whipped by McIntosh up to 10 times with a kettle cord after refusing him sex. The boy told the court McIntosh also beat him with a feather duster, had non-consensual sex with him and would regularly "masturbate us simultaneously". Today, one of the victims said he was relieved at the verdict and labelled McIntosh "evil". McIntosh showed no emotion as the jury delivered its verdict. The jurors were told afterwards that he had been convicted of similar offences in 1988 and 2009. The case was adjourned to July 18 and McIntosh will be sentenced at a later date. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/evil-nsw-man-convicted-of-child-sex-abuse/story-e6frfku0-1226064116624|/images/andrew_dean_mcintosh_2.jpg

COLIN GEORGE McKANE  (VIC - Hamilton / Geelong- 2011)|53 yrs old (2011) |Sentenced in the County Court on the 5-10-1998 to 10.5 yrs jail - 9 yrs non parole. |Abducted a 10 yr old girl from a Christmas street party and molested her. Her friend's screaming made him release her. McKane was on parole for other sex offences at the time. Has a 30yr record for random attacks on girls aged 7-16 yrs old. His priors include: The bashing and raping of a 16 yr old girl and a sex attack on a 9 yr old girl. News (11-10-2012)- "Serial child sex offender tried to bury girl alive" A predatory child sex offender who was jailed this week once tried to bury a girl alive and was recommended for indefinite imprisonment by the public prosecutor. Colin George McKane was sentenced on Tuesday to nine months in jail for tracking down minors for sex after seeing their photographs in a newspaper. At the time he was the subject of a supervision order imposed after he finished a sentence for kidnapping and molesting a 10-year-old girl. At his 1998 trial for the abduction and molestation, the Office of Public Prosecutions asked Judge Leo Hart to declare McKane a dangerous offender, so he could be sentenced to prison indefinitely. Judge Hart refused and sentenced McKane to nine years in prison. At that trial, it emerged that McKane had a long and brutal history of sexual abuse of children, a record police described as one of the worst they had ever seen. He had previously been jailed, in 1995, for phoning children whose picture he had seen in the paper. This is Colin George McKane, the paedophile police believe should never be released, this newspapers John Silvester wrote at the time. For at least 25 years McKane  has been every parents nightmare. He has attempted to bury a girl alive, abducted girls from the street and made hundreds of obscene phone calls that left children terrified. He refused prison sex-therapy programs, flouted parole conditions and reoffended every time he was released from prison. In a confidential police report in 1992, McKane was described as a real threat to females and children. He is a definite sexual deviant and while serving his last prison sentence for rape, declined  medical assistance and counselling. In 1977, a psychiatrist wrote: I think he needs to be hospitalised for further psychiatric assessment in his own interest and also in the public interest. The parole board found he was a long-term recidivist sexual offender, progressing from indecent exposure to indecent assault. Offences had involved knives, scissors and once an unloaded rifle  also notable has been his lack of impulse control, no sense of responsibility, of right and wrong and no remorse. In 1984, McKane bashed a 16-year-old girl with a tyre brace in Warrnambool as she was walking home, put her in his car, dragged her to a beach, assaulted her, then dumped her in a hole, covering her with bracken and debris. The girl escaped while McKane was away. Later that night, when police were examining the scene, McKane returned  with a shovel. Police believed he was going to bury her. http://www.theherald.com.au/story/390216/serial-child-sex-offender-tried-to-bury-girl-alive/?cs=7 McKane Recently reoffended- News (16-11-2011)- "Sex offender gets three years jail for phone calls" A convicted sex monster who tracked down teenage girls in Geelong and made obscene phone calls to them has been sentenced to three years jail. Colin George McKane, aged in his 50s, appeared at a closed hearing in Geelong Magistrates' Court on Monday where he pleaded guilty to 10 Commonwealth charges of using a carriageway to harass, offend or menace. It is unsure why the court was ordered to be closed. The filth-laden calls were made in June this year, after McKane tracked down his victims from their pictures in the Geelong Advertiser. At a hearing in Geelong Magistrates' Court on June 22 this year, Detective Senior Constable Amanda Evans told how one Geelong family answered the phone on June 18 to an "old sounding" man asking to speak to their daughter. Sen-Constable Evans said the girl hung up after the man suggested a sex act. The court was told that, on the same day, another family received a phone call from a man wanting to speak to their daughter. "The following day a man phoned the home of a third girl, asking her age and requesting phone sex," Sen-Constable Evans said. "Police were contacted and the man was later arrested and charged." The court heard McKane was found in possession of three mobile phones, a Geelong phone book and a copy of the newspaper open at the page where the victims appeared. In 1998, McKane, who by then had a 25-year history of random attacks on more than a dozen girls aged from seven to 16, was jailed for 10 1/2 years for sexually molesting a 10-year-old girl. A County Court was told how McKane had snatched the young girl during a street party and indecently assaulted her, before her terrified screams forced him to release her. He had been paroled just five months earlier after serving a four-year jail term for offences in 1995, when he made threatening and obscene phone calls to girls he had seen pictured in newspapers. In the 1980s McKane was jailed for 10 years for an attack on a 16-year-old girl during which he knocked her unconscious, raped her and left her for dead. That crime was committed two months after his release from a five-year jail term for a sex attack on a nine-year-old girl. A County Court judge at the time said McKane committed many of his crimes in public places and did not appear deterred by detection and punishment. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2011/11/16/291461_news.html|/images/Colin-George-McKane-2.jpg

McKenzie preyed on teenage girls online aged between 13 and 16, via Facebook in 2009 and 2010. "Jail for 'manipulative' Melbourne man preying on teenage girls on Facebook" (18-2-2013) A serial sex offender who preyed on teenage girls online and repeatedly asked them to send nude photos to him has been jailed for 15 months. Melbourne man Robert McKenzie, 24, befriended the girls, who were aged between 13 and 16, via Facebook in 2009 and 2010. He repeatedly asked them to send him naked photos of themselves, which two of the five girls agreed to do, the Victorian County Court heard today. McKenzie was also found with up to 350 child porn images. Jailing McKenzie, Judge Meryl Sexton said his conduct was "predatory, persistent and manipulative". She said the offending occurred at a time when sexting was big among young people. The judge said the child porn images, which were found at McKenzie's Altona house, depicted nudity but no sexual activity. She noted McKenzie had a difficult upbringing, had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and was still young enough to learn how to have age-appropriate relationships. Judge Sexton jailed McKenzie for a further 15 months. McKenzie has been in custody since 2010 on other similar matters and is a registered sex offender for life, the court heard. He was due for release in July next year, but Judge Sexton extended his non-parole date until two years from today. McKenzie pleaded guilty to five counts of procuring a minor for child porn and one count of possessing child porn. http://www.news.com.au/national/jail-for-manipulative-melbourne-man-preying-on-teenage-girls-on-facebook/story-fndo4cq1-1226580353201

Sentenced in a WA court in 1990's, to 12 yrs jail - served 4 yrs/ Deported to NZ in 2001.|Jeremy McLaughlin - Child Killer - Found guilty 23-4-2013, of murdering his ex-partner's 13 yr old daughter in her New Zealand home in November 2011.. Convicted in 1997 of the manslaughter of 14-year-old boy in Perth, Australia in 1995..McLaughlin was deported to New Zealand in 2001 after serving 4 yrs of a 12 yr jail sentence. See co-offender.. Craig Wood. "Aussie killer jailed over NZ girl's death" (9-10-2013) A man who had previously been jailed in Australia for the manslaughter of a teenage boy has been given one of New Zealand's longest non-parole sentences for the murder of a 13-year-old Christchurch schoolgirl. Abuse was yelled at Jeremy McLaughlin on Wednesday as he was led from the dock after being sentenced by a New Zealand court to at least 23 years behind bars for the 2011 murder of Jade Bayliss. McLaughlin narrowly avoided being the first person to be jailed for life without parole. During his trial in the High Court at Christchurch, the crown said McLaughlin strangled Jade - the daughter of his ex-girlfriend - and put socks in her mouth when she found him burgling the family home, and then set fire to the house to try to cover it up. In 2001, McLaughlin was deported back to New Zealand from Australia after serving four years for the manslaughter of 14-year-old Perth boy Phillip Vidot. McLaughlin was 18 when he and two others killed Phillip when they robbed him in a Perth park of his joggers and wallet in 1995. Christchurch police were aware of the conviction, but privacy laws prevented them from disclosing it to Jade's mother. Although specialist reports to Justice Graham Panckhurst labelled McLaughlin as a medium- to high-risk candidate for reoffending, he turned down a crown request for a life sentence without parole. Justice Panckhurst said he was taking into account submissions, victim impact reports and McLaughlin's Australian manslaughter conviction in handing down the 23-year non-parole sentence. Jade's mother, Tina Bayliss, described her daughter as the "apple of her eye" who was an exceptional student at Cashmere High School and who had everything to live for. Ms Bayliss said never a day went by that she didn't blame herself for what had happened. She described herself as having been always enthusiastic about life but that she now suffered from constant depression. She and her ex-husband Gary Bayliss said they constantly worried about the effect of Jade's murder on their two younger daughters. Justice Panckhurst said he found McLaughlin's denial of the murder was "simply fatuous" and that the case had been the most compelling he had ever experienced on the bench. He added that McLaughlin's refusal to "acknowledge the obvious was very disturbing". The non-parole option has been open to New Zealand sentencing since 2010 but Justice Panckhurst ruled that McLaughlin was "on the brink but not crossing the line". Phillips mother, Marriya Ann Vidot, and Ms Bayliss were united in the grief caused by McLaughlin after an emotional meeting in Perth several months ago. After the sentencing, Ms Vidot said not a day passed when she did not think of her son and not enough had changed in the justice system. She said it had taken another child to be killed for McLaughlin to get a life sentence and he should never be granted parole. Ms Vidot said while she was 50 per cent relieved at the life sentence, the case had invoked painful memories of her sons death. It is a life sentence for us, she said http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/newshome/19312588/aussie-killer-jailed-over-nz-girls-death/ "Man who killed Australian boy murders girl in NZ" (24-4-2013) http://www.smh.com.au/world/man-who-killed-australian-boy-murders-girl-in-nz-20130424-2ids6.html "NZ police knew of killer Jeremy McLaughlin's past manslaughter conviction" (24-4-2013) Police were told about Jeremy McLaughlin's WA manslaughter conviction when he was deported to New Zealand in 2001, but say there were privacy limits about what they could tell people about him. McLaughlin, 35, was found guilty yesterday of murdering his ex-partner's 13-year-old daughter Jade Bayliss in her New Zealand home in November 2011. After the verdict, it was revealed he was convicted in 1997 of the manslaughter of 14-year-old Phillip Vidot in Perth in 1995, when he was 18. He was deported to New Zealand in 2001 after serving four years of his 12-year sentence. Jade's mother, Tina Bayliss, had been given trespass papers by police days before the incident and planned to serve them if he tried to visit, but police were unable to tell her of the Australian conviction. Canterbury criminal investigations manager Detective Inspector Tom Fitzgerald says police were advised of McLaughlin's deportation, and noted his convictions. "If a person has legitimately completed their sentence served in another country and been released, New Zealand authorities have no legal mandate to impose further conditions upon their release,'' he said. "Under New Zealand law there are constraints on what police can disclose to other parties about a person's previous criminal history.'' Justice Minister Judith Collins told Fairfax Media she had sympathy for Ms Bayliss and said people should be able to get information about someone's convictions if they approached police. The jury in the Christchurch case deliberated for less than three hours before finding McLaughlin guilty. The crown alleged that McLaughlin strangled Jade and put socks in her mouth when she found him burgling the family home, and then set fire to the house to try to cover it up. McLaughlin admitted charges of burglary and arson but denied murder, saying someone else was responsible. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/nz-police-knew-of-killer-jeremy-mclaughlins-past-manslaughter-conviction/story-fnhocxo3-1226628681329 http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/nz-murderer-had-killed-before-in-wa-20130424-2idpn.html|/images/Jeremy_McLaughlin.jpg

"Torquay sex fiend put in jail" (6-3-2013) Torquay sex creep Terrence McMahon has been jailed for five months and placed on the sex offenders register for life after indecently assaulting a young cafe worker in the town. McMahon, 61, was already on a suspended jail sentence for similar offences against an 18-year-old schoolgirl at Torquay in October. He also has prior convictions for assault, wilful and obscene exposure and breaching intervention orders. McMahon, of Gilbert St, Torquay, pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates' Court yesterday to two counts of indecent assault and one of stalking. Police Prosecutor Leading Senior Constable Geoff Lamb said the most recent victim knew the defendant as a regular customer to the cafe where she worked. "On February 11, the victim was clearing tables and her arms were full," Sen-Constable Lamb said. "She was struggling to carry all the items when McMahon walked in. "She asked how he was and he replied, 'Wonderful, Paris', which was a name he gave her, claiming she reminded him of Paris Hilton." The prosecutor said McMahon approached the victim from her right side, then leaned right over and kissed her near her lips. "The victim told police this was a passionate kiss and she was unable to do anything because her arms were full," Sen-Constable Lamb said. "On two other occasions while working in the cafe, the victim had her back to the door when McMahon came up close behind and, with his hand, touched and rubbed a bare section of her back. She told police McMahon gave her the creeps." Defence lawyer Peter Epstein said there was a groundswell of anger among the Torquay community over McMahon's continued offending and conceded there was no option but a jail sentence. "He is a lonely, single man with some issues, who seems attracted to younger people," Mr Epstein said. "He also has a significant lack of insight into the effects of his behaviour towards others and still doesn't believe he has done anything wrong." Magistrate Michael Coghlan said it was clear the victim had no interest in a 61-year-old man. "Clearly kissing her the way you did was not what she wanted and certainly not something anyone should be subjected to," Mr Coghlan said. McMahon was convicted on all counts and sentenced to five months' jail and put on the sex offenders' register for life. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2013/03/06/360586_news.html|/images/Terrence_McMahon_sketch.jpg
LESLIE JOHN McMANUS (Leslie John McManus) (VIC)|N/A|Sentenced in 1997. To be updated.|Sex offender. Leslie John McManus - Sentence of Judge Walsh, 28 August 1997 - In the present case I am satisfied that the nature of each of the offences of attempted rape (counts 2 & 3) was exceptional. I have reached that conclusion for the following reasons: 1. Each of the offences was purpetrated upon a female aged 80 years; 2. The offences were perpetrated within her own home in the course of a prolonged period of nocturnal false imprisonment. 3. They were committed by you after you had entered the home of the victim at her invitation. The concept of safety and security of the home of a member of the community involves his or her right to admit only those who are trusted to be worthy of the privilege of admission. Where an offender establishes the trust of an otherwise defenceless member of the community to the extent that he is invited to enjoy the sanctity of her home and then suddenly becomes an instant predator who places her in a position of serious danger, then, in my view, the nature of the offence is exceptional. .

Benjamin Robert McPartland, 27, was due to face a South Australian Supreme Court trial in February, with his partner, the girl's mother, Ashlee Jean Polkinghorne, 21. But on Monday he pleaded guilty to unlawfully killing Chloe Valentine on January 2012, at Ingle Farm. The couple's lawyer had told a previous court hearing that the death, which the crown said resulted from criminal neglect, was a "tragic accident". Justice Trish Kelly was told the parties are still having discussions about the factual basis of his admission. Polkinghorne is still listed for the manslaughter trial, but the judge was told her matter may also be resolved.

"Paroled rapist jailed for stalking his victim" (4-2-2013) A convicted rapist who terrorised his victim only a few days after being released on parole has been sent back to jail. Ipswich District Court heard Randall Thomas McVoght, 37, was sentenced to seven years jail for the knife-point rape and assault of a 35-year-old woman in September, 2010. He was released on parole in April, 2012, but despite a direct order not to have contact with the victim, he broke into her Bundamba home seven days later, going through the woman's address book in order to obtain her mobile phone number. Crown Prosecutor Caroline Marco said McVoght then sent the woman - a former partner - numerous text messages seeking to rekindle their relationship. The woman resisted for a while but eventually succumbed and agreed to meet with McVoght. Ms Marco said the victim felt as though she had no choice but to give in to her attacker. "She felt that he had a hold over her," Ms Marco said. Despite meeting with McVoght, the woman still refused to restart the relationship. The court heard police attended her house on April 24 to forcibly remove him. The next day, McVoght returned, removing a fuse from the meter box and stealing a bicycle. Ms Marco said the parolee later threw a steel shackle through the victim's window. "She hid inside the house and called the police," Ms Marco told the court. McVoght returned the next day and ransacked the house, destroying furniture, photographs and even the victim's son's school report cards. Police returned McVoght to jail on April 28 last year and he has remained there since. Defence barrister Geoff Seaholme said his client was locked into a cycle of drugs and reoffending and that there was no question that he should go back to jail. The only question was, for how long. Mr Seaholme asked for a shorter head sentence. "His chances of getting parole now - given that these are serious offences against the same victim - he would be very fortunate to get parole," Mr Seaholme said. Judge Sarah Bradley sentenced McVoght to two years jail for the most serious of the charges - stalking and threatening violence. The sentence will be served on top of the existing sentence for rape. McVoght will be eligible for parole from January 31 next year. http://www.qt.com.au/news/jailed-for-stalking-his-victim/1741302/

He pleaded guilty to the murder of Kathryn Daley, 21, whose body was found in bushland in February 2008. Rockhampton Supreme Court Justice Duncan McMeekin sentenced Meredith to life on the murder charge, 12 years for rape, and two years for possession of child exploitation material.

Tough mandatory sentencing is needed Australia wide for sex offenders/ killers.. The vast majority of Australians would agree that Meyers deserved life in jail with no parole-at the very least. Crime Victims Support Association http://www.cvsa.asn.au/index.html "Fighting for just sentencing"- Today Tonight (22-1-2013) For a significant number of prisoners parole is being used as a second chance to offend, leading for victims' families to call for a system overhaul. Those whose loved ones were murdered by parolees are left devastated by crimes they believe should never have been committed. Locked up then let out, career criminals are awarded 'get out of jail free cards' time and time again, only to continue to re-offend while on parole. The aim of the Parole Board is to release offenders who are no longer considered a risk to society, yet almost half the time they get it wrong. According to the Bureau of Statistics, within two years of being released 41 per cent of prisoners are back behind bars. Shirley and Allan Irwin's two daughters were murdered by a career criminal while out on parole. 23-year-old Colleen and 21-year-old Laura were renting their first apartment together since leaving home. What the girls didn't know was the man living next door was about to savagely cut short their dreams, their hopes and their lives. On a Friday night in 2006 in Melbourne's west, he cornered them in their home, brutally raping and stabbing them to death. Allan and Shirley cling to their memories but believe this unbearable heartache could have been avoided. Murderer William John Watkins's record dated backed to 1985 and included convictions for rape, aggravated burglary and assaulting police. The maximum sentence is more than 40 years but he was given four years and released after just two and a half. "Had she known he was on parole there's a fair chance she could have gone to the police station and said 'this bloke is harassing me'," Shirley said. Watkins was fatally shot by police three days after the murders, when he bashed an officer in WA after being pulled over for stealing petrol. Allen and Shirley were thankful they didn't have to go through the justice system to see Watkins punished, but the same can't be said for Noel and Beverley McNamara. Their 29-year-old daughter Tracey was raped and bashed. "She went out that night and the next thing we get a call from the Ferntree Gully hospital saying she was unconscious," Noel said. She died after two days on life support. Rather than serving twenty years for rape and another 25 years for murder, her killer and rapist Noel Meyers, was sentenced to twelve years and freed after ten. "I don't think I've ever felt so angry in my life," Noel said. Helen Wicking's daughter Joanne was murdered, brutally tortured and stabbed by Sean Maraffko - a murder committed just three weeks after Maraffko was released from prison. "A violent prior history and he was just allowed to get out early and free," Helen said. However criminologist Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University, defends the system. "My observations of the various jurisdictions around Australian indicate that sentences are becoming longer - and have been for a long time - and parole is increasingly becoming more difficult to obtain," Professor Smallbone said. Noel McNamara wants concurrent sentencing scrapped, a criminal's prior convictions released publicly, and a minimum sentence for serious offences. "The murderer could have murdered before and they are not allowed to know about it - and that's wrong," Noel said. A recent police survey in WA found that 98 per cent had little faith in the judiciary, citing the sentences handed down by magistrates and judges is not tough enough. We have asked the Attorney-Generals for their response to this story and we plan to follow up. http://au.news.yahoo.com/today-tonight/lifestyle/article/-/15923667/fighting-for-just-sentencing/ "Outspoken Voice Of The Victims" (1-7-2006) http://www.cvsa.asn.au/mystory.html R.I.P - Tracey McNamara http://www.cvsa.com.au/?page_id=393

"'Kiddy toucher' admits working as volunteer for an Adelaide for surf club and CFS" (10-5-2013) A man who calls himself a "kiddy toucher" has admitted to defying conditions imposed as a registered child sex offender by undertaking volunteer work with an Adelaide surf lifesaving club and the CFS. Jason Bryan Michie was given a suspended eight-month prison term early last year for indecently assaulting a seven-year boy he was trusted to babysit. Michie, 24, was placed on a child sex offender register but was back in the District Court today over numerous breaches committed since. Michie has admitted to volunteering at the Port Noarlunga Surf Lifesaving Club and the CFS, to having a Facebook account without notifying authorities and to residing in the shed of a house where an 18-month old child lived. Prosecutor Patrick Hill told the court programs and community events involving the surf lifesaving club and the CFS could have exposed children to Michie. The court heard prosecutors would seek to have Michie serve his original eight-month sentence, as well as a suspended four-month sentence for driving offences - which he breached by being caught riding an unregistered motor scooter while disqualified in August last year. Michie represented himself without a lawyer during today's hearing, after telling Judge Simon Stretton that a bid for legal aid had been rejected and could not afford a lawyer. "You need to understand that you are at serious risk of going to jail, you don't seem to be taking this seriously," Judge Stretton said. .|/images/jason-bryan-michie.jpg

Pierre Elias Mikhail, 24, today admitted to taking and detaining a person with intent to obtain a sexual advantage on October 14, 2010.

She was handcuffed and assaulted, before managing to escape about an hour later. Judge Ronald Solomon noted in Sydney District Court today that Mikhail had a prior conviction for sexual assault and had been on a good behaviour bond at the time of the incident. "He does face a lengthy custodial sentence," Judge Solomon said, adding that Mikhail posed a flight risk.

Pleaded guilty to charges including 76 counts of possessing objectionable child abuse computer games,and 74 of making them. "Teacher gets six months for child porn" (18-11-2004) A North Rockhampton teacher who had 58,000 child pornography images on his computer was sentenced to six months' jail yesterday. Peter Francis Millan, 40, pleaded guilty in Rockhampton Magistrates Court to charges including 76 counts of possessing objectionable child abuse computer games and 74 of making them. Millan was also on a tainted-property charge for having possession of a computer for an illegitimate purpose. The court heard that Millan had saved a number of images to the hard drive, compact disc and zip disc. Police prosecutor Constable Darrell Dalton told the court of a number of previous child- abuse sentences, including the case of a Victorian man jailed for 18 months for possessing 45,000 images. "While (that) case was of a different nature, the volume of images of Millan's exceeds that case,'' he said. Millan's solicitor, Jeff Clarke, said his client had felt remorse and guilt. Magistrate Annette Hennessy said a community- based order was not sufficient. "The 75 games saved to disc are permanently stored and highly transportable,'' she said. "Imprisonment needs to be served.''

In 2011 Millard pleaded guilty to two counts of using a carriage service to procure a child under 16 for sex, will be sentenced on August 5. "Police pose as girls to snare internet predator" (7-7-2011) A Victorian man engaged in sexually explicit internet chats with police officers posing as two teenage girls and arranged to meet them for sex, a court has heard. Cameron Bruce Millard, 42, thought he was chatting to 13- and 14-year-old girls, and told them he wanted to have sex with them. Millard arranged to meet them at suburban railway stations, but he did not show up for the meetings, prosecutor Robert Corr said. During the conversations he asked the officers posing as girls about their breasts and masturbated in front of them on a webcam. When one of them said she was a virgin, Millard replied: "Not for long". Millard was jailed in South Australia last year for inciting a child to perform an indecent act after an online conversation with a South Australian police officer posing as a girl. That conversation took place around the same time as the Victorian one. When Millard was paroled in South Australia after serving 10 months he was immediately re-arrested and extradited to Victoria. Millard's barrister Philip Skehan said his client had an intellectual disability and was effectively an "eight-year-old in a man's body". He urged Judge Campton to place his client on a release order, which is similar to a suspended sentence. Mr Corr said the fact that no child had suffered did not diminish the seriousness of the offending. He said it was clear Millard knew what he was doing was illegal. Millard, of Croydon, who pleaded guilty to two counts of using a carriage service to procure a child under 16 for sex, will be sentenced on August 5. http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/police-pose-as-girls-to-snare-internet-predator-20110707-1h437.html#ixzz2ZkS19jg9 "Man jailed for seducing girl, 13" (28-9-2010) A Victorian man attempted to seduce a 13-year-old girl and travelled to Adelaide to meet her, but "chickened out", a court has heard. Cameron Bruce Millard, 41, of Melbourne pleaded guilty to one count of inciting an indecent act by a child. In sentencing today, Judge Rosie Davey said Millard travelled to Adelaide but "chickened out" of meeting with the girl - actually an undercover police officer. She said Millard had spoken with the intended victim using an internet chat program for about a month and planned the meeting as part of a trip to SA, where he also wanted to visit his infant son. During those chats he performed indecent acts on himself and asked the intended victim do the same. He also asked for a picture of the girl's breasts. On arrival in Adelaide he contacted the intended victim, but then made excuses to avoid the meeting. Judge Davey said it was important to protect young people, particularly teenagers, using the internet. "It is important that it is widely known in the community that the risk of being caught by police is very real," Judge Davey said. "It is important for the community to know that police officers are regularly conducting operations and engaging in chat room conversations."

DARYL DOUGLAS MILLER (Daryl Douglas Miller) (WA - Maylands)|18 yrs old (2014)|Sentenced 20-3-2014, in the WA District Court, to 27 months jail - May be paroled as early as Nov, 2014.|Daryl Douglas Miller - Sex Offender. Teen victim says says the justice system let her down by giving her attacker a soft sentence while she would suffer for the rest of my life. (The sentence) doesnt make me feel like justice has been served, she said -below. "Teen sex assault victim says her attackers soft jail term has let her down" (22-3-2014) A teenage sex assault victim says the justice system let her down by giving her attacker a soft sentence while she would suffer for the rest of my life. The 18-year-old wrote to The Sunday Times week after the man who preyed on her was jailed for 27 months  but could be out by November. This is despite the court hearing he was a high risk of reoffending and had shown limited remorse. (The sentence) doesnt make me feel like justice has been served, she said. I was punched, grabbed by the throat, shoved against a wall. I was restrained by him when I tried to escape. I was thrown into dirt and muddy water. The teenagers attacker, 18-year-old Daryl Douglas Miller of Maylands, was jailed in the District Court on Thursday. The court heard he followed the victim as they left the East Perth train station in the early hours of September 22. They were not known to each other. Miller had just smoked five cones of cannabis and in the days before he had used alcohol and amphetamines. As the victim walked through the train station car park Miller grabbed her, but she ran off. He then chased her, pinned her up against a wall, threw her to the ground and sexually assaulted her. The victim says lenient sentencing and victim blaming by some people in the community had created a rape culture in Australia. I feel like we instil guilt and paranoia into the minds of the victims, rather than focus on telling rapists not to rape, she said. Her frustration comes as Attorney-General Michael Mischin was this week forced to order a review of WAs Dangerous Sex Offenders Act after one of the states worst serial rapists was released from prison. Within days of being released the sex monster, known as TJD, was arrested for allegedly breaching one of his reporting conditions. He has attacked more than a dozen women in the past 23 years. The teenager who wrote to The Sunday Times said she had nothing but admiration for the police who investigated her case: The police officers and detectives work hard, deal with horrendous crimes and risk their safety for the sake of others (and) for that I am immensely grateful, she said. http://www.news.com.au/national/western-australia/teen-sex-assault-victim-says-her-attackers-soft-jail-term-has-let-her-down/story-fnii5thn-1226862100957

Miller was also sentenced in December, 1983, to 15 months' jail, which was suspended after he served eight months, for indecently assaulting a 13-year-old patient. "Ex-GP to serve six months jail" (12-5-2007) A former Bendigo doctor was jailed for six months yesterday for indecently assaulting three teenagers during internal examinations at an Arnold Street clinic. David Frederick Miller, 63, tutted loudly as Judge Pamela Jenkins sentenced him in Bendigo County Court to a total of three years' imprisonment, 30 months of which she suspended for two-and-a-half years. Supporting himself with a walking stick, the pensioner appeared visibly shaken as a policeman led him away. Miller pleaded guilty on Thursday to indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl in 1977, a woman aged 18 or 19 in 1979 and a 16-year-old girl in 1980 when he was working as a medical practitioner at the Arnold Street Medical Clinic. Judge Jenkins said immediate imprisonment was the only appropriate sentence. 'As a medical practitioner, you were in a position of trust and authority, which you grossly abused,'' she said. Miller was sentenced in December, 1983, to 15 months' jail, which was suspended after he served eight months, for indecently assaulting a 13-year-old patient. .|/images/david_frederick_miller_2.jpg

"Rapist's appeal against sentence thrown out" (19-6-2012) A man who raped a woman while she was sleeping has had his appeal against his sentence dismissed by the Supreme Court. Grant Lawrence Miller had been sentenced to five-and-a-half years in jail with a non-parole period of one year and nine months after pleading guilty to rape in Mt Isa District Court on February 7, 2012. The court heard the victim had spent the night of May 30, 2009, out with friends and family and returned home about 2.30am. The then-18-year-old had told police she had fallen asleep on a mattress in the living room fully clothed. The court heard she awoke to find her pants and underwear had been removed and Miller raping her. Miller was known to the victim, but they were not romantically involved. Miller said he initially denied the rape because he was embarrassed and had been drinking heavily on the night. He appealed his sentence on the grounds it was manifestly excessive. The Supreme Court justices considering the application heard Miller was 18 at the time of the offence and 21 when he was sentenced. He had no criminal history and at the time of his sentencing was in a stable relationship with a woman who was pregnant with their first child. Miller had strong employment prospects and had received a reference from his work supervisor that he was otherwise of good character. The sentencing judge had noted the aspects of Miller's life since the rape which were positive, as well as his guilty plea. However the sentencing judge also said the seriousness of the crime - raping a woman as she slept in a place where she had felt comfortable - could not be ignored and imposed the five-and-a-half-years sentence. The three Supreme Court justices reviewed the sentencing judge's decision and remarks and found he had not made an error, nor was the sentence excessive for the crime. Miller's application to appeal his sentence was dismissed. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/rapists-appeal-against-sentence-thrown-out-20120619-20lfr.html#ixzz1yVDfEMx4

William Thomas Dunbar Milne has been at the Maribyrnong Detention Centre since May when he was paroled after serving a seven-year prison sentence for the sexual assault of 10 girls aged seven to 11. The Scottish-born Milne, 69, has lived in Australia since 1970 and has been fighting to remain here, but last week a Full Bench of the Federal Court upheld Immigration Minister Chris Bowen's decision to deport him. The minister ordered Milne's visa cancellation because he failed to complete a sex offenders' rehabilitation program in prison and had shown little insight into his offending. Lawyers for Milne argued he had not had the opportunity to complete the course in prison, but the Full Bench of the Federal Court has upheld the decision to cancel his residency visa. "In the present case, the (Administrative Appeals) Tribunal had before it no information on whether the appellant was willing to undertake a sex offenders' program," the court said. In 2005, Judge Ian Robertson said when sentencing Milne: "Through your vile actions, Mr Milne, you have caused so much harm to so many children and so many families, including your own family." http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/court-rejects-appeal-from-sex-fiend/story-fn6bfkm6-1226030275253

He had pleaded guilty in the District Court in Mackay to using the internet to access child pornography. Moffatt was caught with 1640 child pornography files on his computer at his Mackay home in an Australian Federal Police raid. They also found copies of images on a memory stick at Moranbah, where Moffatt worked. EARLIER: Edwin Moffatt had 1640 files of child pornography on his computer when Australian Federal Police raided his Mackay house. Officers then went to Moranbah, where Moffatt worked, and found copies of the images on a memory stick. The 64-year-old admitted that he had been collecting the images for several years. He pleaded guilty in the District Court in Mackay yesterday to using the internet to access child pornography. Moffatt had a previous conviction in November, 2002, in Innisfail, for indecent treatment of a child, Commonwealth Crown prosecutor Amy Knott said. He was jailed for 12 months, which was later reduced to six months on appeal, she said. Moffat was arrested in Mackay in September last year after AFP received a tip off from Interpol. Of the 1640 files in his possession, 10 were videos. Ms Knott said the possession of child pornography was not a victimless crime as it exploited children somewhere in the world. "The children involved in these files can not protect themselves," she said. Defence barrister Greg Walsh, for Moffatt, said Moffatt was sexually abused as a child, and since his arrest he has been undertaking rehabilitation with experts in the field. "He accepts unreservedly that people like him, who access vile pornography, are contributing to the exploitation of children," Mr Walsh said. The Crown asked for a sentence of 18 to 24 months. The defence said the sentence should be about 15 months, with release after serving one-third of the sentence. Judge Julie Dick, SC, adjourned sentencing until today and granted Moffatt overnight bail. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/raid-nets-child-porn-collection/1534750/|/images/edwin_moffatt_2.jpg

It is exceptional by reason of the time of day and place which it occurred, the number and nature of the sexual acts persisted in , the associated violence and the profound effect on the victim. The bare fact that the victim was attacked at a particular hour or on a particular day of the week is not enough to make the nature of the offence exceptional [but] In my view it was open to the judge to find that to attack a woman in a public place in broad daylight and rape her a few metres away from a foot and bike path, using the threats and violence which this applicant did, made the nature of this offence exceptional. .

News (23-8-2012)- "Tyrendarra man pleads guilty to underage sex charge" A Tyrendarra man who admitted having sex with a 15-year-old girl in 1997 has been told he is fortunate to not be serving an immediate term of imprisonment. Andrew Simon Montgomery, 38, of Princes Highway, pleaded guilty in Warrnambool County Court on August 10 to one charge of sexual penetration of a child aged under 16 years. Sentencing was adjourned until yesterday so Judge Mark Taft could get sentencing statistics from the time of the offence. Judge Taft yesterday said that after anxious consideration and some misgiving he had determined to hand down a wholly suspended jail sentence. He sentenced Montgomery to two years imprisonment but suspended the jail term for three years. Judge Taft said the substantial delay, withdrawal of the complaint and revitalisation of the police investigation and Montgomerys guilty plea were all significant factors. He told Montgomery that he hoped he took notice of the chilling account of the victim tendered to the court through the victim impact statement. She should not have had to go through that experience. You can consider yourself fortunate that you are not going to jail today, he said. Judge Taft said the victims statement was a distressing document and the impact of the offending had been profound. The woman said in the statement she had sought much help from medical professionals after spending about 10 years trying to bury herself in alcohol and drugs. She said she would not wish what had happened to her on her worst enemy and that she never wanted anyone else to be Montgomerys victim. Montgomery was also placed on the sex offenders register for 15 years News (10-8-2012)- "Man pleads guilty to sex with under-age girl in 1997" A Tyrendarra man who admitted having sex with a 15-year-old girl in 1997 has had his case adjourned so a judge can gain more information about sentencing. Andrew Simon Montgomery, 38, of Princes Highway, pleaded guilty in Warrnambool County Court this week to one charge of sexual penetration of a child aged under 16 years. The prosecution alleged that at the time of the offending, Montgomery knew the victims brother. On the evening of April 26, 1997, the girl was at home with her parents reading before she left the family home about 10.30pm to meet up with friends. Her friends did not arrive in central Portland and she met up with other associates. Just after midnight Montgomery pulled up and the girl and a couple of her friends got into his car to go for a drive. Montgomery was told the girl was 15 years old. -read more- http://www.standard.net.au/story/193439/man-pleads-guilty-to-sex-with-under-age-girl-in-1997/

Sexually assaulted his tutor while in custody at the Capricorn Correctional Facility. http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2011/02/22/extra-jail-term-for-assault-on-tutor/ Prisoner assaults his tutor (22-2-2011) JUST 10 days shy of being released from jail, Hadley Graham Mooney sexually assaulted a female tutor who was helping him with a computer at Capricornia Correctional Centre. Mooney plead guilty to the charge of sexual assault and the brazen attack cost him at least an extra two months in jail. The 29-year-old man was jailed in September last year for his involvement in a violent home invasion that saw the occupant lose his eye. The Rockhampton Magistrates Court heard on Friday that while in custody at the Capricorn Correctional Facility, Mooney had sexually assaulted his tutor. Mooney was taking part in a computer class on February 3 with two other prisoners when the tutor was assisting him. Police Prosecutor Karen Dunham said the tutor reported that she had been standing by Mooney and had noticed his hand move to his groin area but assumed he had simply been scratching himself. She said he then reached out and grabbed her with a full hand on the vagina area. The tutor then stepped back and said dont do that Hadley and he let go. The court heard she then left the classroom and walked up the hallway with Mooney following her. She said she heard Mooney saying something about his computer password and asking what was wrong but she continued walking until she reached a secure area. She then told security who called Rockhampton Police. Defence solicitor Shayne Studdert said Mooney had said he had gotten the wrong impression from the tutor and when she said to back off he did. Mr Studdert said Mooney was due to be paroled on February 28. Magistrate Cameron Press sentenced Mooney to six months imprisonment with a parole eligibility date of April 29. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/story/2011/02/22/prisoner-assaults-his-tutor-capricornia/
DAVID WARREN MOORE (QLD- Brisbane)|58 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in November 2010, in the Brisbane District Court, to 15 mths jail - Sentence wholly suspended.|David Warren Moore - Pleaded guilty in November 2010 to 1 count of possessing child exploitation material. Moore has previous offences for sodomy and indecent behaviour and was jailed for 2.5 yrs in 1987. News (3-11-2010)- "Former cop avoids jail time for child porn") A former Queensland policeman who featured in a TV show for kids has avoided jail for keeping child pornography at his workplace. David Warren Moore, 55, pleaded guilty in the Brisbane District Court on Tuesday to one count of possessing child exploitation material. On Wednesday, he was handed a wholly suspended 15-month sentence. Moore, who was known as "Constable Dave" in the 1980s when he appeared alongside the puppet Agro on the children's TV show Wombat, was caught with the vintage film when police went to his Brisbane workplace in May last year. The court was told Moore directed the officers to a box of porn he had stored in his office, telling them it contained a video that had child exploitation material on it. The tape contained about 13 minutes of video showing naked boys rock climbing and boating, with the focus on their genitals. Moore, who has previous offences for sodomy and indecent behaviour, told officers he was given the tape about 10 years earlier and had forgotten he had it. Moore sobbed in court on Wednesday as details of his public fall from grace were recounted. http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-national/former-cop-avoids-jail-time-for-child-porn-20101103-17d7d.html News (Nov- 2010)- "'Proper scrutiny'" Queensland Attorney-General Cameron Dick says he has no concern about the media coverage of the case. He says reporters are entitled to do their job. "Every Queenslander is entitled to go into an open Queensland court and see justice being delivered, and so too can the media," he said. "The media can report on any case in any Queensland court. "I have no concerns about the coverage of this case - it's important in a democracy that our courts receive proper scrutiny and i have no concern about the coverage of this case." Deputy Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg says no-one should be tried by the media, but the main issue is the sentencing. "There is always a public interest particularly in cases like this, and I suppose there is an argument that sometimes that can go a little bit too far," he said. "Having said that I think the principal consideration for any sentencing judge has to be 'does the punishment fit the crime and is the community going to be protected by the sentence?'" http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-03/former-policeman-sentenced-over-child-porn-charge/2322016

DARRYL MORGAN (WA- Oombulgurri)|yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 10 yrs in jail.|Darryl Morgan- Convicted of 21 counts of abuse against 2 girls. Hope at last for 'hell on earth'- (8-10-2010) IT was just days after the Howard government announced its controversial intervention in the Northern Territory when the man dubbed Oombulgurri's sheriff boasted his community was free of child sex abuse. Reading Darren (Darryl) John Morgan's comments in a local Perth newspaper in mid-2007, Kimberley detective Tom Doyle - who had been investigating shocking cases of child sex abuse across the north of Western Australia - was instantly suspicious. "Darryl Morgan was pictured holding a baby and saying, 'This is the only place without child sex abuse.' That's probably what sparked the investigation into Oombulgurri, I looked around and asked a few of the Aboriginal ladies in Kalumburu [900km northeast of Broome], 'Is it happening over there?' "Most of those women were from Oombulgurri originally and they said, 'That's exactly what's happening over there.' " Three years on, Morgan, the community's head warden, has been convicted of 21 counts of abuse against two girls as young as 12, and has been sentenced to 10 years in jail. His wife, Shirley Ann Veronica Bulsey, was convicted on four counts of child sex abuse, including two of preparing one of the girls for Morgan to have sex with. She has been sentenced to four years and nine months in jail. The charges against Morgan and Bulsey were among 109 laid against seven alleged offenders after Doyle and a team of sex crime detectives spent 18 months uncovering what they describe as the town's "deeply guarded secret". Doyle says everyone who had links to the town, including government workers, knew that child sex abuse had been going on for years but no one knew what to do. "It was hard to approach and deal with something that had been going on for so long," he says. Victims felt extreme shame and were too afraid to come forward because of the level of fear and intimidation exerted by some of the town's leaders. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/hope-at-last-for-hell-on-earth/story-e6frg6z6-1225876662037
PETER ANDREW MORGAN (QLD- Townsville)|42 yrs old (2010)|Sentenced Dec 2010, in the Townsville District Court, to a 9 months jail - sentence wholly suspended.|Peter Andrew Morgan- Was charged with 2 state counts of possessing child exploitation material.. charged as part of Taskforce Argos a Queensland Police investigation targeting the illegal accessing and downloading of child pornography "Men walk free over child porn charges" (11-12-2010) A Townsville man who distributed a graphic tutorial over the internet describing how to sexually abuse young children will walk free in just three months after being sentenced yesterday. Timothy Hinspeter, 36, pleaded guilty to one count of distributing and three counts of possessing child exploitation material. On November 18, 2007, police discovered Hinspeter was circulating an explicit pictorial tutorial via a peer-to-peer file sharing site. The four-minute guide detailed how to sexually assault girls from infancy through to 13 years of age. Explicit instructions about different objects that could be used while performing illegal acts were provided. It also specified ideal times to carry out such offences to ensure a spouse would not discover what was going on. The file displayed 39 images of young girls. Hinspeter was arrested on March 5, 2008, after a raid at his home. In addition to the tutorial, police seized his laptop and numerous hard drives, which contained 42 child porn videos, some as long as 45 minutes. They depicted as many as three young children being molested by men. In handing down his sentence, Judge John Baulch SC told Hinspeter: "There is no indication the nature of the offence shocked you or caused you to reconsider or stop what you were doing." Hinspeter was given 18 months' jail for the distribution charge, to be wholly suspended after just three months. He will then be subject to two years' probation. Meanwhile, two other Townsville men also charged as part of Taskforce Argos a Queensland Police investigation targeting the illegal accessing and downloading of child pornography have pleaded guilty and walked from court. Ashley Kenneth Kearns, 48, and Peter Andrew Morgan, 42, both appeared this week in the Townsville District Court. Judge John Baulch SC said the pair, who were regular visitors to pornographic websites that offer illicit images and videos of underage children, was involved in a "disgusting trade". Kearns, an ex-employee of Ergon Energy, faced 22 charges. He also appeared on 21 commonwealth charges of using a carriage service, namely the internet, to download child pornography material. He was given two wholly suspended sentences 18 months in jail for the Commonwealth offences and ordered to pay $2000 recognisance, while he was given six months' imprisonment for the state charge. Peter Morgan, a fitter and turner, was charged with two state counts of possessing child exploitation material . He was given a nine-month jail sentence wholly suspended. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/12/11/191771_news.html
TERRY MORGAN (VIC - Sale, 2005)|yrs old|Sentenced to 3 months jail in 2005.|Terry Morgan - Convicted in September 2005 of 4 counts of indecent acts on a child under 16, and possession of child pornography.. Victims were 2 girls aged 8 and 12 yrs. "RAAF told me: cover up assault of girls" (26-12-2005) A RAAF employee of 20 years whose children were sexually assaulted by a senior officer was forced to resign after defence bosses allowed the attacker continued access to the base where she worked. The woman's daughters, aged 8 and 12, were assaulted by former wing commander Terry Morgan in June. When the woman tendered her resignation a month later, her commanding officer asked her to remove the reason from her letter, and to "let it go". "You don't want this to follow you around," the woman says she was told. Morgan, a pilot and former family friend, was convicted in September of four counts of indecent acts on a child under 16, and possession of child pornography. He resigned from the RAAF that month, taking with him the full "entitlements that were legally owing to him", the Department of Defence said. He continued to enjoy access to the base during the months before his trial, while on bail. The woman's letter read: "My resignation is in the main due to a pedophile who is employed as a senior officer in the RAAF at this base. This individual attacked my two young girls four weeks ago and my family and I no longer feel safe in this locality." The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, refused to alter her letter. The officer who allegedly told her to rewrite it, Wing Commander Terry Atkinson, declined to comment. Morgan is serving a three-month jail sentence, having abandoned an appeal. The woman, who joined the RAAF in 1985 when she was 18, initially in uniform, before taking on a civilian job in 2001, believes she was mistreated by the Defence establishment. The Department of Defence is still reeling from a parliamentary report on its military justice system, and is burdened by retention and recruitment problems. The combined services are 1000 people short of personnel targets, and the Federal Government has just announced it wants to expand the army by 1500. The woman says the department tried to "cover up" the incident, instructing pilots at RAAF East Sale in Victoria, where Morgan worked, not to talk or ask questions about the assault. "All staff including myself were being told it was in my best interest not to talk about the situation," she said. "Here the RAAF were pretending it didn't happen and forbidding people to ask questions. I was horrified at how it was brushed under the carpet." She is also angry that she was never informed that Morgan, while on bail, was allowed full access to the base where she was working. "He should have been made to hand in his ID and told not to come on base," she said. A Defence spokeswoman said: "Until an individual has been found guilty of any allegations made against him/her, the presumption of innocence prevails unless a court makes an order prescribing otherwise. Mr Morgan's bail conditions are a matter for the civilian authorities. To Defence's knowledge, his access to the base was not in breach of bail conditions, with no breach being reported to the local police." The woman says she was never offered assistance to move to another base - an option that was open to her employers under the Defence Employees' Certified Agreement, but which she learnt of only after she resigned. A Defence spokeswoman said: "Defence did seek to address safety concerns of [the woman]." Asked to elaborate, she said: "As soon as Defence became aware of [the woman's] concerns, her unit commander sought to address these concerns by recommending she access appropriate counselling and support mechanisms available to her under departmental policy and agreed to a period of leave from the workplace to allow her time to access these services." The woman said this happened only at the time of her resignation. She said that since the assault, her eight-year-old had "clinically regressed to [the age] of a four-year-old and has reverted to sucking her thumb. She is also extremely violent and cannot control her anger." Her 12-year-old suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorders, is under psychiatric care and on antidepressants. The woman says she wants the Australian Defence Force to "take ownership for the stuff that goes on its own backyard, and not hide it all the time". "Terry Morgan has destroyed my little girls' lives and was allowed to retire with his life fairly well intact to those who don't know, due to the RAAF cover-up. "My girls, on the other hand, have had to move states and they will carry this memory for life." http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/12/25/1135445486554.html?from=rss

Former Teacher. . "High school teacher Stephen Peter Morrow, 58, jailed for getting a Victorian student pregnant escapes disciplinary action by Queensland authorities" (30-8-2011) A high school teacher jailed for getting a Victorian student pregnant and later paying for her abortion in the 1990s has escaped disciplinary action by Queensland authorities who granted him registration to teach here seven years ago. The Queensland Civil and Administration Tribunal (QCAT) has granted the Queensland College of Teachers (QCT) "leave'' to cease disciplinary action against 58-year-old Stephen Peter Morrow - who obtained Queensland teachers registration in September 2004. QCAT, in a just published five-page decision, allowed the QCT to withdraw disciplinary proceedings against Morrow because it was satisfied the "public interest is protected'' due to fact the former teacher was "excluded person'' because of his child sex offence conviction and was no longer legally allowed to teach in Queensland. Morrow, now aged 58, was sentenced to three years jail after pleading guilty in a Victorian County Court last year to five charges of sexual penetration of a 16 or 17-year-old girl under his care under the Victorian Crimes Act of 1958. In April 2008 Morrow was convicted of more serious charges and jailed for six years, but the Victorian Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial. During the earlier court cases it was revealed Morrow, then a physics teacher at Melbourne Girls' College in the 1990s, had sex with a 16-year-old student. The court was told the girl, who was a virgin before Morrow had sex with her, discovered she was pregnant and later aborted the foetus. QCAT members Michelle Howard, Adrian Ashman and Robyn Oliver, in a just published five-page decision, granted QCT's application to withdraw disciplinary proceedings against Morrow on August 1. "QCT submits that Mr Morrow is now an excluded person under the Education (Queensland College of Teachers) Act 2005,'' the panel said. "(QCT says Morrow) is not entitled to apply for teacher registration or permission to teach because he is a relevant excluded person who is subject to offender reporting obligations. "In essence, QCT submits that the disciplinary proceedings are therefore unnecessary and that the public interest is protected by his status as an excluded person.'' QCAT, by way of background, said Morrow was granted registration to teach in Queensland in 2004, but that registration was suspended shortly after his arrest by the Victorian Police Service in November 2006. In reaching its decision whether Morrow should be subjected to disciplinary action, the panel said: "The relevant legislative provisions are technical and somewhat tortuous to navigate.'' "Disciplinary proceedings are protective, not punitive in nature. "The tribunal is satisfied that the public interest is protected as a consequence of Mr Morrow's status as an excluded person ... (and) for leave to be granted to QCT to withdraw disciplinary referral relating to Mr Morrow.''  http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/high-school-teacher-stephen-peter-morrow-58-jailed-for-getting-a-victorian-student-pregnant-escapes-disciplinary-action-by-queensland-authorities
ALAN FRANCIS MORTIMER (QLD- Ipswich)|62 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 2 yrs jail.|Alan Francis Mortimer - sexually abused a 9 yr old girl. Dad pays for pedophile threat- (19-3-2011) AN IPSWICH man who confronted a convicted pedophile over allegations of child abuse will spend the next nine months behind bars  while another pedophile caught grooming a boy of 11 is to serve just six months. The two men faced Ipswich District Court in separate hearings as controversy raged over two other sentences passed down by magistrates this week. The sentences which allowed two men who dragged a pony behind their car and a flood-looter who stole an elderly womans jewellery to avoid jail time prompted a furious reaction from Queensland Times readers. In the latest case, a 43-year-old stepfather went to the caravan home of pedophile Alan Francis Mortimer with two other men who are yet to face trial. The defendant, who cannot be named to protect his stepdaughters identity, was incensed when the seven-year-old girl claimed Mortimer had exposed himself to her inside his caravan. Unknown to the stepfather, Mortimer was on bail after being accused of sexually abusing a nine-year-old girl. He was later convicted of that crime and is now serving a two-year jail sentence. The stepfather waited outside Mortimers caravan in February last year while the other men went inside, armed with a bat, and brought him outside. They forced Mortimer, 61, into a car and drove him to where the girl was waiting with her mother. When the girl identified him, Mortimer claimed he was assaulted by the stepfathers accomplices, leaving him with a sore right hamstring. The stepfather was convicted of entering a dwelling while armed and in company and deprivation of liberty, but cleared of assault. Judge Gregory Koppenol sentenced him to 18 months jail to be released on parole on December 17, saying it was important to send a strong deterrence to would-be vigilantes. Crown prosecutor Sarah Dennis said: It was not the defendants job on that day to act as judge, jury and executioner. The Queensland Times understands Mortimer has not been charged over allegations he indecently dealt with the mans stepdaughter. He claimed it was simply a misunderstanding. While the protective stepfather will spend nine months in jail, a convicted sex offender who was caught with more than 10,000 child exploitation images after he tried to groom a young boy received a lighter sentence. Anthonie Roberto Hellemons, 45, yesterday pleaded guilty to two charges of indecent treatment of a child aged under-12 and one of possessing child abuse material. In December 2002, Hellemons invited the 11-year-old Ipswich boy to his house. He sat him on his lap, touched his stomach and stroked his hair while showing him an email which contained photos of nude adults. He then showed the boy a pornographic film. The child complained to his mother, who went to police. Police searched Hellemons home and discovered 10,543 child porn images on his computer and 1119 child abuse movies. Crown prosecutor Clayton Wallis said Hellemons was grooming the child. The court heard Hellemons was convicted in 1997 of sodomising an 11-year-old boy and sexually abusing him with a glass tube and gas bottle and sentenced to five years in jail. Judge Sarah Bradley sentenced Hellemons to 18 months in jail, to be suspended after he serves six months. Hellemons was charged before penalties for child sex offences were increased and the maximum sentence at the time was two years. Defence barrister Steve Kissick said his client believed he should spend no time in jail as he had stayed out of trouble for several years. http://www.qt.com.au/story/2011/03/19/dad-pays-for-pedophile-threat-ipswich/

ANDY MUIRHEAD (TAS- Hobart)|36 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Andy Muirhead - Former ABC television host - Pleaded guilty to child pornography offences. Andy Muirhead in custody on child pornography charges- (31-7-2012) The former ABC television host Andy Muirhead is being held in custody tonight after pleading guilty to accessing child pornography on his home computer. The police found more than 12,000 images of child pornography and 24 videos on Muirhead's computer when they searched his Hobart home in 2010. The former host of Collectors has written a letter apologising for his actions, saying the things he saw were vile and disgusting. Felicity Ogilvie reports from the Supreme Court in Hobart, and a warning, this story contains descriptions of child abuse. Andy Muirhead's lawyer describes her client's fall from grace as significant. The 36-year-old Tasmanian has gone from presenting the national TV show Collectors and hosting breakfast radio on the ABC in Hobart, to pleading guilty to child pornography charges. The prosecution says the pornography Muirhead accessed involved children as young as three years old. Of the more than 12,000 images that were found of Muirhead's home computer the majority were of children, who were often naked, posing erotically. The prosecution rated the severity of the images, saying there were also hundreds of photos of girls and boys engaged in sexual acts with other children and adults. The worst rating went to the 62 images that Muirhead had accessed of children being treated sadistically and images of bestiality and bondage. The prosecutor, Maitland Lincoln, told the court that Muirhead was a regular and consistent user of child pornography and downloaded it almost daily. He said that in one of the images a child appeared to be crying. The court heard that the Australian Police were first alerted to Muirhead's activities by Interpol in Luxembourg after Muirhead downloaded four images in May of 2009. The Federal Police then watched Muirhead for more than a year before arresting him in June 2010. A sample of the images that Muirhead had accessed were then shown to the court. Most of Andy Muirhead's family and friends left the court when the images were shown. Journalists who remained in court said that Muirhead looked down and cried while the pictures were shown. Later, Andy Muirheads defence lawyer Kim Baumeler described how the former ABC TV and local radio host is unlikely to be employed in the industry again. She said he had been largely unemployed since being arrested two years ago and has moved back in with his parents. She read a letter to the court that Muirhead had written. He apologised for his actions saying what he did was shameful, reckless and stupid. The former TV host also said the things he saw on his computer were vile and disgusting and he said that he couldn't imagine how much hurt had been caused to the people depicted in those images. His lawyer, Kim Baumeler, told the court that Muirhead has been getting counselling and seeing a psychologist since his arrest and that he has the support of his family and friends. The maximum sentence for the crimes of accessing child pornography and possessing child exploitation material are between 10 to 21 years jail. The judge has remanded Muirhead in custody and plans to sentence him in two weeks time. http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2012/s3557695.htm Former ABC host Muirhead pleads guilty to child porn- (31-7-2012) FORMER ABC presenter Andy Muirhead has pleaded guilty to three charges relating to child pornography in the Tasmanian Supreme Court. The court has been told that Muirhead used peer-to-peer software to access more than 12,000 picture files and 24 videos. Prosecutor Maitland Lincoln said Muirhead had changed software after reading articles about a child pornography ring busted by police in May 2010. The ages of children depicted ranged from three to 14 and at least 60 were in the worst category, showing the explicit or sadistic treatment of children. Muirhead looked down as graphic examples of the images and videos were played to the court. He had previously pleaded not guilty to the charges. His plea hearing is set to continue this afternoon. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/former-abc-host-muirhead-pleads-guilty-to-child-porn/story-e6frea6u-1226439355701|/images/andy_muirhead_2.jpg

See co-offender - Loren Marita Fothergill. "Babysitters from hell guilty of child pornography charges in Brisbane District Court" (8-5-2014) Babysitters from hell who photographed themselves in sexual poses with a toddler have been jailed after police found the images stored on computers alongside child porn movies, photos and animation. Engaged couple Nicholas James Murdoch, 27, and Loren Marita Fothergill, 28, pleaded guilty in Brisbane District Court today to 10 counts of indecent treatment of a child, making child exploitation material and for possessing child exploitation material. Crown prosecutor Phil McCarthy said Australian Federal Police investigating the pair over a large quantity of child pornography material found photos that revealed the indecent treatment of a little girl, aged between two and three, and the creation of exploitative images between April 2011 and March 2013. Mr McCarthy said the images showed Fothergill holding the childs genitalia open with her fingers and showed Murdochs erect penis being held by the child. The girl was positioned in the photos so that her genitalia was exposed for the camera. He said the couple tried to downplay the images when police contacted them, saying they were within the realm of ``a childs curiosity. Judge Brian Harrison said the couples offending amounted to ``blatant abuse. .

ERIC JAMES MURRAY (Eric Murray) (NT/ QLD)|66 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced July 2013, in the Brisbane Supreme Court, to life in jail.|Eric James Murray - Murderer/ Rapist. Murray's life of violent crime began in 1964 and that his litany of sadistic and brutal offences included murder, extreme violence, kidnapping, false imprisonment and rape. Justice Byrne sentenced Murray to life imprisonment, saying: "You have a monstrous criminal history ... (and) you murdered a woman (Ms Quinton) you barely knew.'' -below. "Eric James Murray, 66, sentenced to life in prison for murdering June Quinton in Brisbane in 1996" (25-7-2013) A "monstrous" murderer and "sex slave'' rapist is likely to die in a Queensland jail after being found guilty of the savage 1996 slaying of a 60-year-old Brisbane woman. A Brisbane Supreme Court jury deliberated just four hours before finding Eric James Murray, 66, guilty of murdering June Quinton by bashing her to death with a metal bar and dumping her body in long grass at West End, in Brisbane's inner-city between January 27-31. It is the second jury empanelled to decide Murray's fate after a jury was discharged on Monday after failing to reach a verdict after almost three days of deliberations. What the jury did not know, and The Courier-Mail can now reveal, is that at the time of the murder, Murray had been on parole for the horrendous 1981 NSW murder of a man in front of his children. Also, after fleeing Brisbane following the slaying of Ms Quinton, Murray went onto kidnap a 17-year-old girl in the Northern Territory in 2003, and subjected her to unspeakable acts while keeping her as his "sex slave'' for three days. Murray received a 24-year jail sentence for that crime and was likely to die in a NT prison cell had he not confessed to killing Ms Quinton. Justice John Byrne, within seconds of the jury delivering its verdict, took the rare step of suggesting it may be in their best interest to stick around for Murray's sentencing. "I think you might find (Murray's) criminal history instructive,'' Justice Byrne said. Prosecutor Danny Boyle then revealed Murray's life of violent crime began in 1964 and that his litany of sadistic and brutal offences included murder, extreme violence, kidnapping, false imprisonment and rape. Justice Byrne sentenced Murray to life imprisonment, saying: "You have a monstrous criminal history ... (and) you murdered a woman (Ms Quinton) you barely knew.'' "You are a serious danger to the community. You are sentenced to life in prison.'' Murray turned belligerent after Justice Byrne left the court and tried to remonstrate over the decision with a handful of people in court. The Brisbane jury was told Ms Quinton's murder was likely never to have been solved had Murray not made a jailhouse confession - his motivation being to get a prison transfer to a jail closer to his family. Murray - who earlier had tried and failed to win a transfer from the Alice Springs Correctional Centre to Queensland via an application to former Queensland Corrective Services Minister Judy Spence - expected the move would mean his family could visit him more frequently. On August 18, 1981, Murray murdered lecturer David Morrison-Howie, 32, in Bathurst, 200km north west of Sydney, in front of the victim's wife and two children, aged 19-months and 3-years-old. Murray stole a 12-gauge shotgun to gun down Mr Morrison-Howie after a daring prison escape from the Kickconnell Afforestation Camp. He served 14-years of a 16-year prison sentence for those attacks and was on parole when he beat Ms Quinton to death in retaliation for her "being rude'' to him as they shared a meal provided by an inner-Brisbane charity - St Vincent de Paul. Prosecutors said Murray bashed Ms Quinton to death, wrapped a t-shirt around her head and dumped her body in a vacant block near the Pauls Milk Factory at West End. Murray then fled Brisbane and Ms Quinton's remains were not found until factory workers sought the source of a foul odour. Murray remained on the run for almost eight years but again captured national media attention when he abducted a NT teenager and held her as a sex slave for at least three days in 2003. The NT courts were told Murray repeatedly raped and threatened to kill the teenager during her harrowing ordeal. It was expected Murray would have died in a NT prison had he not confessed to killing Ms Quinton. During a March 2010 prison interview with Queensland detectives Murray was recorded saying: "It doesn't bother me if it (Ms Quinton's murder) gets solved or not. "I was going to let it go. Some kind of people keep that stuff (to the grave).'' But, when pressed by police if he was making a false confession to gain a prison transfer his reply was adamant. "Is it the case Eric that you didn't do it ... and you're using it (the confession) to get to Queensland?" a detective asked him. Murray: "I tell you now I killed her. I'm giving you something that happened.'' http://www.news.com.au/national-news/queensland/eric-james-murray-66-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-murdering-june-quinton-in-brisbane-in-1996/story-fnii5v6w-1226684988884|/images/eric-james-murray-2.jpg
GEOFFREY GRAEME MURRAY (Geoffrey Murray) (VIC - Warrnambool)|27 yrs old (2010)|Sentenced Nov 2010, to 22 months jail - 1 yr non parole..Murray had already spent 105 days in custody which will count as time served.. added to the sex offenders register for life.|Geoffrey Graeme Murray- Repeat Offender- Pleaded guilty to theft, obtaining property by deception, failing to appear on bail, committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 and three counts of being a registered sex offender who failed to comply with reporting obligations..Previously convicted of committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 years in 2004. "Prison for sex fiend" (17-11-2010) A repeat sex offender has been jailed for almost two years after pleading guilty to a number of offences. Geoffrey Graeme Murray, 27, of Warrnambool pleaded guilty to theft, obtaining property by deception, failing to appear on bail, committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 and three counts of being a registered sex offender who failed to comply with reporting obligations. He was convicted and sentenced to a total effective term of 22 months imprisonment with one year non parole and has also been added to the sex offenders register for life. Murray has already spent 105 days in custody which will count as time served. Previously convicted of committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 years in 2004, Murray was placed on the sex offenders' register. There are a number of obligations through that registration and he has to report any unsupervised access with children. But during July and August Murray was having regular contact with girls as young as 14 without reporting and the court heard on at least one occasion introduced a girl to another registered sex offender. In August, Murray drove two teenage girls to Melbourne and bought them alcohol. When one of the girls became heavily intoxicated and was falling asleep, Murray undressed her and indecently assaulted her. The court heard the removal of the girls clothing happened more than once despite attempts made by the other girl to prevent it. Magistrate Ron Saines described Murrays behaviour as predatory. Noting this was the sixth time Murray had been sentenced for similar sex-related matters and the 18th time he had been sentenced for theft and dishonesty-related offences. Mr Saines said the court had to have a strong emphasis on denunciation, deterrence and punishment. Mr Saines also ordered Murrays drivers licence be suspended for two years. He was also ordered to pay $200 compensation to Cash Converters where he sold a stolen bicycle. * The South Western Centre Against Sexual Assault can be contacted on 5564 4144 or after hours on 1800 806 292. http://www.standard.net.au/story/787579/prison-for-sex-fiend/|/images/Geoffrey_graeme_murray.jpg

JARROD NADORT (VIC- Bendigo, Lockwood)|24 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 5-5-2011, in the Melbourne County Court to 10 yrs jail - 7 yrs non parole.|Found guilty by a jury of 2 counts of Rape and one of assault. Violently raped and assaulted a 15 yr old girl. Pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16. Victim was a 12 yr old girl. See Co/offender - Dale Goss. News (6-5-2011)- "Rapist gets 10 years"- Lockwood man Jarrod Nadort has been sentenced to 10 years jail for violently raping and assaulting a 15-year-old girl. The sentence also takes into account two charges of sexual penetration of a child under 16, relating to a 12-year-old girl on a different occasion. Nadort, 24, was sentenced in the Melbourne County Court yesterday morning. During his trial in Bendigo last month, the court was told Nadort had been caught in the act when another person walked into the spare bedroom and found him kneeling over the teenage victim who was crying and screaming. A female witness told the court she saw the victim try to crawl away from Nadort. Nadort did not deny having sex with the teenager, but said it was consensual. He was found guilty by a jury of two counts of rape and one of assault. In a victim impact statement, the victim described the pain and anguish the rape had caused. I felt that I had a tattoo across my forehead after Jarrod had attacked me and I felt vulnerable because of it, she said. I would try and act tough so I didnt seem vulnerable to the outside world, but really I was feeling anything but tough. I felt easy targeted, naive, empty, used, violated and fearful. The scars from this incident may not be visible, but I live with the pain, the mental and emotional scars every day. The rape occurred at a 21st birthday party in February last year. Four months later Nadort twice had sex with a 12-year-old girl in a bungalow at his parents house. Nadort pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16. His friend, Dale Goss, 25, of Golden Square, pleaded guilty to one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16. At the pre-sentence hearing for all matters, prosecutor Patrick Southey called for a sentence of seven to 10 years with a non-parole period of five to seven years for Nadort, and two to three years jail with a non-parole period of 12 to 18 months for Goss. Judge Rachelle Lewitan said Nadorts offending was very serious, considering the violent nature of the rape and the fact that the victim was affected by alcohol. Nadort will be eligible for parole after seven years. Goss was sentenced to two years jail with a non-parole period of 16 months. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/rapist-gets-10-years/2154635.aspx News (3-6-2010)- "Girl, 12, rape charges"- Two Bendigo men have been charged with the rape of a 12-year-old girl. The men, both in their 20s, are alleged to have consumed drugs and alcohol and had sex with the girl in full view of their friends despite her pleading with them to stop. Long Gully man Dale Goss, 25, and Jarrod Nadort, 23, of Lockwood were arrested on Tuesday after the girl made a report to police. They appeared in the Bendigo Magistrates Court yesterday afternoon for a bail application. It was opposed by police on the grounds that the charges were of such a serious nature that the men were considered a flight risk. Prosecutor, Leading Senior Constable Dave Somerton said police also believed the men would interfere with prosecution witnesses and endanger the safety of the victim if allowed back into the community. Despite their concerns Magistrate Jennifer Tregent granted bail. Detective Senior Constable David Newman from the sexual crimes squad said Goss and Nadort picked up a group of people, including the girl, from KFC in Bendigo on Saturday night. He said the group then drove to Nadort's bungalow at his parents' house where they consumed alcohol and the two men smoked cannabis. While in the Bungalow, the court was told, Nadort began touching the girl and had sex with her on a bed. ``She was telling him to stop, she was trying to push him away,'' Detective Senior Constable Newman said. Nadort is alleged to have had sex with the girl a second time that night. He is alleged to have followed the girl out to a rear shed, pushed her onto a mattress and tried to remove her clothes. When she struggled he allegedly slapped her across the face and then had sex with her. Goss is alleged to have had sex with the girl on a couch inside the bungalow. Detective Senior Constable Newman said the girl awoke to find Goss standing over her naked. He then removed her clothes and lifted her on top of him while he sat on the couch and they had sex, the court heard. Two other people who were present at the time have made statements to police alleging they witnessed Nadort and Goss have sex with the girl. Both men deny the allegations. Nadort is charged with two counts of rape, two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16, one count of common law assault and one count of indecent assault. Goss is charged with one count of rape, one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and one count of common law assault. They will return to court in September. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/girl-12-rape-charges/1848098.aspx|/images/jarrod_nadort_2.jpg

Sentenced 27-7-2012, in the Townsville District Court, to 5 yrs jail - 4 yrs non parole...has served 220 days pre-sentence custody.|Edward George Nallajar/ Repeat Offender/ Declared a serious violent offender in 2004 and again in 2012..Sentenced in 2004 after he pleaded guilty to 2 charges of rape, 1 of taking a child for immoral purposes,and Indecent treatment of a child under 12 yrs..Victim was an 8 yr old girl. Nallajar was sentenced in 2012 after attempted to rape an 11 yr old girl in May 2011..Pleading guilty to indecent treatment of a child under 12, unlawful deprivation of liberty and enter premises with intent. News (28-7-2012)- "Underage sex called 'cultural'" A man who says it's "become a cultural thing" on Palm Island to sleep with underage girls has been jailed for five years, after he attempted to rape an 11-year-old. His comments have enraged Palm Island elders and Indigenous spokespeople, who have called his remarks "appalling". Edward Nallajar, 37, lured his young victim to a laundry room with cannabis and $50 in May 2011, and tried to pull his shorts down and hers too. He was interrupted by the girl's brave friends, who pushed open the door where she was being held and pulled her out. A psychologist said Nallajar showed little remorse when he was interviewed afterwards. Nallajar told her most children on Palm Island weren't virgins and said, had he offered more money, the girl may have been more willing. He said having sex with children on Palm Island was a "cultural thing". But Professor Gracelyn Smallwood, a prominent Indigenous activist, said this was definitely not the case. "I've spoken to a number of key elders on Palm Island and they're disgusted at him saying it's culturally appropriate," she said. "It's absolutely appalling he used that in the courts. Under Aboriginal law, before white fellas came, you were actually speared or killed (for a crime like this)." Professor Smallwood has long campaigned against violence and rape, especially in Indigenous communities, and said it was a concern others might adopt the same excuse. She said prison sentences for offenders like Nallajar needed to be reviewed. "He has to have some serious mental health counselling," she said. "It should be compulsory, not elective, for every person in jail to take healing classes for their crime. There needs to be some serious accountability in terms of the institutions." Judge Stuart Durward SC had adjourned the matter for two weeks to decide whether Nallajar's intention was to rape the girl that day. He concluded yesterday in Townsville District Court that it was. "I'm satisfied that your intention in taking the girl to the laundry was to sexually interfere with her," he said. "It was only the brave intervention of the other children that prevented you from giving effect to that intention." Judge Durward SC declared Nallajar a serious violent offender, meaning he will have to serve at least 80 per cent of his five-year sentence. He has served 220 days pre-sentence custody and will be released after four years. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2012/07/28/350481_news.html News (12-7-2012)- "Friends rescued girl from rape, court told" A young girl was saved from a convicted rapist by her heroic friends, who pushed open the blocked door where she was being held and pulled her out. The 11-year-old girl and her friends were playing marbles in the yard of a Palm Island home when they were approached by the offender in May 2011. The man, Edward George Nallajar, had been released from prison that week for raping an eight-year-old girl, and asked the children if an adult was home. He then lured the children to the home's laundry with a $50 note and cannabis. He grabbed the girl and closed the door to the small room with them inside, locking the others out. Her friends pushed on the door as the 37-year-old tried to pull the girl's shorts down and his own, while the terrified girl cried out for help. Prosecutor for the Crown Susan Hedge told a Townsville District Court one of the children got through and pulled the defendant away. "It was only due to the bravery of the other children that the complainant (wasn't raped)," she said. "The defendant said to the psychologist he would have had sex with the (child) if he wasn't interrupted." Nallajar's previous rape conviction against the eight-year-old girl was in very similar circumstances, including luring the girl with cannabis to some nearby school grounds, where he had committed sexual assaults. He had also been convicted of manslaughter when he was 18 years old and was jailed for six years. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2012/07/12/346111_news.html

AVINESHWAR NAND (NSW- Quakers Hill)|40 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced June 2012, in the NSW District Court, to 11 yrs jail - 7.5 yrs non parole.|Avineshwar Nand/ Repeat Offender..pleaded guilty to sexual assault and rape. News (29-6-2012)- "Man jailed over rape at train station" A Sydney man has been jailed for up to 11 years for repeatedly raping an 18-year-old woman as she slept at an inner-city railway station and filming it on his phone. AVINESHWAR Nand had carried on the attack despite several train passengers walking past, the NSW District Court was told. Nand bowed his head slightly and covered his face as the sentence was read out in the court on Friday. The 40-year-old from Quakers Hill, in the city's northwest, began the predatory attack after spotting the young woman sleeping on a bench at Newtown railway station during the early hours of December 16, 2010. The woman, who has not been named for legal reasons, had drunk alcohol the night before and had not slept for several days because of a bout of insomnia. Nand took advantage of her deep slumber and raped her several times, filming the entire ordeal on his iPhone. The film, later found by police, and CCTV footage from the station played a key role in the case. It was revealed in court that Nand was on parole at the time of the attack and had previously broken into homes in 2004 and 2006 and indecently assaulted two women inside.

In 2010, Shane Narkle, now aged 48, became one of the few sex offenders in WA to be detained permanently, after a judge decided he posed a significant danger to society having committed two rapes 17 years apart. Locked up indefinitely under the state's Dangerous Sexual Offenders Act, Narkle had already been unsuccessful in one appeal against his detention, after the courts ruled he still posed a major risk to family members and the public. But in a Supreme Court judgment handed down on Monday, Justice John McKechnie ruled Narkle could be released under the strictest supervision, despite concerns. "I have concluded that the respondent remains a serious danger to the community,'' Justice McKechnie said. "I am nevertheless satisfied that the community will be adequately protected if the respondent is released on a supervision order with strict conditions for a period of four years.'' Those conditions include a monitored abstention from alcohol and drugs, a curfew for up to 12 months, regular reporting to authorities and consistent counselling. In a previous ruling, Narkle was described as ``violent, cowardly and callous''. In 1987, he was jailed for eight years after being convicted of drunkenly raping his 62-year-old aunt, an invalid pensioner who was blind in one eye and could only walk with a stick. After being released, Narkle was involved in numerous acts of violence - including beating his de facto wife who was six months pregnant - until in 2004 he was sentenced to six years in for another sex crime. He raped a female acquaintance while beating her around the head with a piece of wood, having enticed her back to his home after a drinking session at a local park. After becoming eligible for release in 2009, the state's Director of Public Prosecutions appealed, arguing no supervision conditions were sufficient to protect the community. Justice Stephen Hall agreed, saying Narkle posed a ``serious danger to the community ... (and) a largely unpredictable risk that could occur opportunistically''. In late 2011, Justice McKechnie turned down an application for Narkle to be freed. But on Monday, the same judge ruled differently, despite being told by a psychologist Narkle's risk of reoffending was "chronic'', and his reluctance to find work means ``he will have very little to do and the temptation of both alcohol and sexual offending will be great''. WA's laws allowing dangerous sex offenders to be jailed permanently were introduced in 2005, sparked in part by the repeat offending of Garry Narkle, who was described by former attorney general Jim McGinty as a ``serial sex monster''. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/national/sex-offender-shane-narkle-freed/story-fndo6e6y-1226549067861 News (10-1-2013)- "Detaining sex offenders in WA indefinitely" Seven years ago, then-West Australian Attorney General Jim McGinty was working on a law that could lock away serious sex offenders indefinitely. At the time he had people like Garry Narkle on his mind - a repeat sex offender whose crimes later went on to include a prolonged sexual assault on a homeless man. The year before WA's Dangerous Offender Act was drafted, Mr McGinty had publicly branded Narkle "a serial sex monster". Sex offender Garry Narkle is currently in prison and not eligable for release until 2019. When the legislation passed state parliament in 2006, WA became only the second state in the country to attempt indefinite detention for sex offenders. "There were a small number of very dangerous sex offenders who would always re-offend," Mr McGinty said. "The community needed to be protected against those people and we legislated for the first time in WA to keep people in detention after they had completed their term if they were repeat offenders and posed a risk to the community. "It was groundbreaking legislation when we brought it in." More than half a decade later, 38 people have been deemed dangerous sex offenders under the Act  four of those in the past year, according to Department of Corrective Services data. Of those people, 15 remain behind bars indefinitely after serving the court imposed sentences for their crimes, with no knowledge of when they will be released. One prisoner has been held in custody indefinitely since November 2007. Mr McGinty still believes there are a "handful" of sex offenders who should not be reintroduced back into society - who have no hope of reform - who simply pose too great a risk of re-offending. This week a different man named Narkle - who was deemed a dangerous sex offender and held for a further three years after serving his sentence - was freed. The release of Shane Narkle on Monday reignited a debate about balancing human rights against public safety on Perth's talkback radio programs. Unlike the more notorious of the two sexual offenders, Shane Narkle's two victims were known to him. The attacks were violent, brutal  no doubt scarring. But they play out on court transcripts not as calculated hunting exercises, rather as opportunistic drunken assaults. And he served his time for them, before being further detained under the Act in 2010. Mental health assessments of Narkle in the months before his release revealed he had not responded to counselling  his treatment requirements were in fact "unaddressed," according to a psychiatrist's report presented at his annual detention review. On Monday Supreme Court Justice John McKechnie found Narkle was still a serious risk to the community, with relapse into alcohol abuse a key risk factor for reoffending. But his circumstances had changed, he had stable accommodation available to him and family support. Justice McKechnie released Narkle to a Rivervale unit in a complex known for antisocial behaviour. Mr McGinty was shocked. "I was surprised by the decision of Justice McKechnie that he decided even though he posed a high risk, that the risk could be managed," he said. "In those hardcore small number of cases often they refuse to undertake treatment or programs while in prison and they remain a high risk." There were conditions to Narkle's release  he would be subject to counselling and four years of regular supervision, and failure to meet these commitments would see him back behind bars. He would also be a prime candidate for WA's new GPS ankle monitoring devices for sex offenders. "I think we'll all pay the price of bringing him into the community," Mr McGinty said, adding that he did not believe perpetrators of multiple serious sexual assaults could be reformed. "If all three of those components were there  repeat, violent and serious - and on a number of occasions then this is someone who is going to re-offend," he said. Murdoch University human rights lawyer Anna Copeland said laws that hold people indefinitely "probably breach Australia's human rights obligations at international law". And the assumption that somebody could not be rehabilitated would have to be balanced against the severity of taking their liberty indefinitely, she said. "The difficulty with indeterminate detention is also the psychological effect on the person being detained," she said. "If they don't know - if they don't have any inkling as to when the detention will end - that can have some very serious psychological effects." Garry Narkle is currently in prison for the assault on the homeless man and not eligible for release until 2019, at which time the Director of Public Prosecutions could make an application to have him held indefinitely. http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/detaining-sex-offenders-in-wa-indefinitely-20130109-2cgqr.html

ROBERT TYLER NASH (QLD- Fairney View)|66 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced Feb 2011, in the Ipswich District Court, to 3 yrs probation - conviction recorded.|Robert Nash- Pleaded guilty to making child exploitation material, Feb 2011. Prior history- 1985/ convicted of 3 charges of indecent dealing with young boys, and sentenced to 3 yrs jail which was reduced on appeal to 2 yrs. Paedophile's art offensive (2-2-2011) A CONVICTED pedophile will be banned from contact with minors after creating an obscene and pornographic drawing. The 66-year-old man, who was convicted of abusing young boys in 1985, recently admitted he created the child exploitation material despite no real children being involved in his art. Police received a tip-off about the drawing and searched Robert Tyler Nash's Fairney View home, near Fernvale, on June 16 last year. The drawing depicted adult men involved in explicit sexual activities with young boys. Ipswich District Court heard Nash seemed to think the drawing was funny when speaking to a psychiatrist. He also tried to blame his deviant Behaviour on his non-smoking, Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden said. Ms Farnden said the drawing was made more serious, considering Nash's previous criminal offending. In 1985 Nash was convicted of three charges of indecent dealing with young boys and sentenced to three years jail which was reduced on appeal to two years. But Ms Farnden said there was no evidence Nash planned to distribute his offensive image. Nash pleaded guilty to making child exploitation material. He was put on three years' probation with a conviction recorded. Nash will be required to undergo drug and alcohol counselling, psychiatric counselling, a sexual offenders program and he will be banned from unsupervised contact with children under 16. He will also be subject to reporting conditions under the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004. Defence barrister Debra Wardle said the public shame which followed from the Queensland open court system would also punish her client. Ms Wardle said no children were harmed in the making of the drawing and Nash never planned to show anyone. He came to realise it was offensive, Ms Wardle said. Police searched his computers and no other downloaded material was found. The material was for his personal gratification.http://www.qt.com.au/story/2011/02/02/ipswich-paedophiles-art-is-offensive-history/

ZANE CHARLES NEAVE (Zane Neave) (WA)|32 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Zane Charles Neave pleaded guilty in November 2012, to child sex offences and possessing child pornography.. Victim was a 14 yr old boy. Co-Offender - Kirsty Joy Robinson "Ex-pub workers plead guilty to child sex crimes" (20-11-2012) The former licensee of a Great Southern pub and one of his employees have admitted to a range of sex crimes against a 14-year-old boy. Zane Charles Neave, 32, who was the licensee holder of the Gnowangerup Hotel, has pleaded guilty to three counts of sexually penetrating the juvenile. He also admitted to indecent dealings with the boy and possessing child pornography. Kirsty Joy Robinson, 21, admitted to indecently dealing with a child and indecently recording a child, with the court hearing she filmed and took photos of Neave abusing the boy. The pair is due to be sentenced in the District Court in Albany on February 18. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-20/ex-hotel-workers-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-crimes/4382154 "Alleged sex romps could floor country publican" (4-4-2012) A country publican faces a liquor industry ban amid allegations he was involved in sex romps with a teenage boy and a barmaid at a hotel. As revealed on the PerthNow iPad last night, police will allege Zane Charles Neave, 32, showed the boy explicit images of child pornography and gave him alcohol before they engaged in threesome sex acts which were filmed at the Gnowangerup Hotel, 370km south-east of Perth. Police will also allege the trio became intimate soon after Mr Neave took over the pub. It is alleged the relationship continued for nine months during which time they shared a bed and showered together. Police raided the hotel on February 7 and allegedly uncovered hundreds of child exploitation images. Officers will also allege those images were of the boy and pictures downloaded from internet file sharing sites. A laptop computer, cameras, thumb drives and mobile phones were also seized and are being examined by police. Police will allege the barmaid, Kirsty Joy Robinson, 20, took photographs of Mr Neave and the boy having sex, which will now form part of the prosecution against the licensee. Mr Neave has been charged with two counts of possessing child pornography, six charges of indecent dealings with a child and five counts of aggravated sexual penetration of a child aged between 13 and 16. Ms Robinson has also been charged with six counts of indecently dealing with a child and five counts of aggravated sexual penetration of a child between the ages of 13 and 16. They will appear in Albany Magistrates Court on May 31. It is understood the alleged sexual encounters happened in an upstairs room of the pub, which the licensee planned to renovate into a creche or kids' club to use while their parents visited the downstairs bar. Now, police have lodged a submission with the WA Liquor Commission, calling for the liquor licence of Zacheave Pty Ltd, of which Mr Neave is a director, to be cancelled. It is understood the submission claims Mr Neave is "not a fit and proper person" to hold a licence because of the child sex allegations against him. Police have also called for Mr Neave to be disqualified from holding any position of authority at a licensed venue and be fined. Gnowangerup officer-in-charge Dave Murphy said police started the criminal investigation after a thumbdrive was handed to officers by a worker who found the device in the hotel's laundry in October last year. "We will allege the thumbdrive contained child exploitation material," Sgt Murphy said. "The allegations are that the licensee groomed him, was involved sexually with him and it carried on from there." Police said once the forensic examination of the seized items was completed, more charges may be laid. It is understood Mr Neave left the town a month ago. The pub is undergoing renovation. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/alleged-sex-romps-could-floor-country-publican/story-e6frg143-1226318769869

Piotr Nedza pleaded guilty 2 counts of rape, one count of creating risk of harm and attempting to dissuade a witness over the offending. "Piotr Nedza jailed for at least five years for raping woman, pouring petrol down her throat" (12-9-2013) A man who raped a woman and poured petrol down her throat has been ordered to serve more than five years in prison. Piotr Nedza, 41, was charged with two counts of rape, one count of creating risk of harm and attempting to dissuade a witness over the offending over an incident at Paralowie in February 2010. Today in sentencing Judge Rauf Soulio said the victim was "clearly terrified" by Nedza's behaviour. "Offences of sexual violence against the vulnerable cannot be tolerated," he said. Judge Soulio said although Nedza pleaded guilty to the offences, he was not entitled to any discount for his plea because of his attempt to withdraw his plea which caused distress to the victim. "In fashioning the sentence I have been required to impose, I have endeavoured to reflect the seriousness of your offending and the impact of your offending on the victim." Nedza was also sentenced for failing to comply with a bail agreement and failing to comply with a restraining order.

News - They peaked when parents discovered the chaplains were giving caretaker work and accommodation to convicted paedophile Michael Nilsson at a Humpty Doo family crisis centre, close to many schools -below. "Probe into chaplaincy after poisonous drama" (27-11-2010) One-to-one chaplaincy of students will be reviewed after a church program became part of a poisonous drama involving everything from a pedophile to teachers' threatened boycott of certain kids. The Education Department review has been forced by an Ombudsman's investigation into the Living Waters Chaplaincy Service to five Darwin rural area schools. The investigation identified several breaches by chaplains, "concerning" one-on-one sessions with students, and inadequate monitoring of the service. The bulk of the problems happened late 2007 and into 2008. They peaked when parents discovered the chaplains were giving caretaker work and accommodation to convicted pedophile Michael Nilsson at a Humpty Doo family crisis centre, close to many schools. While Nilsson eventually fled, tensions remained. Parents complained chaplains were inappropriately accessing confidential family information, propagating religion and providing services to students without proper training or permission. Staff at Humpty Doo Primary - one of the five schools - began protesting about suffering sustained harassment from some parents, in and out of school. Then principal Felicity Hancock told investigators of a "horrendous" time. "(There) were all sorts of accusations, there were emails that you couldn't make sense of talking about dead puppies, things like that," she said. Ombudsman Carolyn Richards' report noted a "particularly concerning" development was the proposed boycott by some teachers at the school of teaching services to kids of complainants. The report said one-on-one pastoral care services caused the most concern. "In one instance a psychologist who later treated a student was of the opinion that the chaplain provided psychological services without the required qualifications," it said. "... nobody knew what services were provided during one-on-one sessions, nor the appropriateness or quality of those services." The report said a common theme in the probe was a need for extra resources. It said schools were too hasty implementing chaplaincy services in their rush to get funding and did not spend enough time drawing up appropriate policies and guidelines. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2010/11/27/196921_ntnews.html "School at 'crisis point'" (17-11-2008) A school on the outskirts of Darwin is at "crisis" point and staff have pleaded for help against a campaign of harassment by parents. Almost all Humpty Doo Primary school staff - from teachers, administration staff to groundsmen - have been on the "receiving end of some really quite severe abuse", school council chairman Ted Murphy said. "I'd been aware of isolated instances of teachers being on the receiving end of abuse, but I was startled when the magnitude of this was brought to my attention," he said. Independent MLA Gerry Wood has joined the council in calling for the Education Department to protect teachers. Staff revealed at a school council meeting this week that they have been subjected to abuse and harassment in shopping centres, by emails and phone calls. Mr Murphy and Mr Wood said staff were at breaking point - and some were considering quitting the school. The Education Department refused to allow principal Felicity Hancock to be interviewed yesterday. Executive director schools north Alan Green blamed the animosity on a small group of parents who had long been opposed to a Uniting Church chaplaincy program in the school. The opposition started after it was discovered the church had allowed convicted pedophile Michael Nilsson to do voluntary work at its Humpty Doo family crisis shelter last year. But Mr Green could not explain why administration or grounds staff would be harassed. School council member Kim Hawthorne - who has lodged a complaint with the NT Ombudsman about the chaplaincy service - said she knew of no improper behaviour by parents. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/11/17/16385_ntnews.html
ROY ANTHONY NEUMANN (QLD- Gympie)|48 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced May 2012, in the Ipswich Magistrates Court, to 6 months jail - granted immediate parole.|Roy Neumann - 2 counts of committing an indecent act in public. News (21-5-2012)- A sex pest caught in the act of publicly pleasuring himself in his vehicle twice in a month has avoided jail time. Roy Anthony Neumann was charged with committing an indecent act in public after a passer-by spotted him engaged in an act of masturbation, within view of the skate bowl in Warwick's Queens Park on March 6. Police alleged at the time that Neumann was watching a video on his mobile phone while performing the act on himself. He was charged with a second such count on March 21, when police officers located him inside his vehicle while it was parked on Horsman Rd, in the vicinity of the Glennie Heights SS. Neumann, 48, had his case transferred from Warwick to the Ipswich Magistrates Court where he was convicted on both counts of indecency on April 24. A spokesman for the Warwick Police Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB) said public self-pleasuring was an offence under the Queensland Criminal Code. "In the first instance, this person was located by a member of the public at approximately 2.20pm on the day in question inside his vehicle, which was parked near the skate bowl," the spokesman said. "He was seated in the driver's seat of the vehicle with his underwear lowered and engaged in the act. "On the second occasion police were called to Horsman Rd where his vehicle had been observed and Neumann was arrested for the same offence." The Horsman Rd incident prompted calls to the Daily News as well as to police on the day, from concerned parents who had been walking their children home from Glennie Heights State School and who had seen Neumann openly masturbating inside his car. One mother claimed at the time that Neumann's vehicle had been observed on Horsman Rd on previous occasions at school finishing times. Neumann was sentenced in the Ipswich Magistrates Court to six months imprisonment, but was granted immediate parole. http://www.gympietimes.com.au/story/2012/05/21/caught-in-the-act-in-public-twice-masturbation/

PAUL BARRY NOONAN (Paul Barry Noonan) (VIC - Derrinal)|41 yrs old (2013)|Sentence to be updated.|Paul Barry Noonan - Pleaded guilty December 2013, in the Bendigo County Court, to downloading child pornography. "Child pornography collection could end in prison term" (5-12-2013) A man who downloaded more than 500 child pornography files could face jail. Paul Barry Noonan, 41, pleaded guilty on Thursday to downloading the files at the home he shares with his mother in Derrinal, north of Heathcote. A tip-off from the Australian Federal Police led to Noonan's arrest and the seizure of his computer and USB hard drives in January this year. The Bendigo County Court heard Noonan had saved a collection of 584 files between February 2009 and January 2012. The images and videos showed children aged between five and 15, with most depicting low-level categories of sexual content. Noonan had named one of his USB drives 'Santa'. Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions' Aman Dhillon said it was very serious offending that perpetuated the abuse of children. "Without people distributing it and downloading it there would be no need for children to be exploited, degraded and violated," he said.

"Man jailed over violent sexual assault" (7-5-2013) A Perth man has been jailed for more than nine years for violently sexually assaulting a woman in her own home as her four-year-old daughter slept in a nearby room. James Alexander Nugent entered the home in May last year through an unlocked door after the woman's partner had left for work. He slapped, punched and threatened her with a screwdriver during the attack. Nugent entered pleas of guilty earlier this year. In sentencing today, Judge Philip Eaton noted counsel did not agree on whether Nugent had threatened to rape the woman's daughter, as claimed by the prosecution. But he said the attack would have been terrifying regardless. "I accept in your case that your offending was spontaneous and that you were probably in the house, as I say, to commit a property offence rather than an offence of a sexual nature,'' Judge Eaton said. .

Andrew Nutter, 52, of Doubleview, stood trial in the District Court this week accused of indecently assaulting the woman in her Balga home in the early hours of January 20, 1991. Nutter was alleged to have put his hand over the womans mouth as she slept while laying on top of her. Nutter pleaded guilty to breaking and entering the home with intent to commit an offence but not guilty to indecently assaulting the woman in her bedroom. Late this afternoon after a two-day trial, a jury of eight women and four men found him guilty on the indecent assault charge.

On the opening day of the trial yesterday the woman, who was 21 years old at the time of the incident, gave evidence. The woman said she woke up to find Nutter on top of her and pinning her to her bed and his hand over her mouth. .   Search

News (4-3-2011)- "Parole plea by child molester rejected"- Convicted child molester Denis Allen has been refused parole for the second time in two years. The 76-year-old was sentenced to a maximum 14 years in prison in November 2000 for a string of serious sex crimes involving 11 boys. He was sentenced to a further three years behind bars, to be served concurrently, in 2002 after he pleaded guilty to fresh allegations involving a nine-year-old boy and a 10-year-old boy. Allen became eligible for parole in November 2009 but his application was refused. He was refused parole again at a private hearing yesterday but will have another opportunity during a public hearing at Parramatta on March 29. The retired butcher and former football coach preyed on boys for 33 years, recruiting them by preaching the joys of independence and risk-taking and encouraging them to drink. He told a psychiatrist that the boys were special to him and claimed to have loved them. If they resisted his advances he would often resort to tears, tantrums and bribes and, in some cases, physical and emotional cruelty. One victim said that Allen would often play a game of blindman's buff, covering his eyes and then fondling the genitals of several young boys in order to guess their identities. His victims were all affected by the crimes and some suffered major psychiatric problems in later years. http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/parole-plea-by-child-molester-rejected/2093386.aspx|/images/denis_frederick_allen_2.jpg

News (8-7-2011)- "Port Stephens bus driver indecently assaulted 16-y-o girl" A FIFTY-seven-year-old Port Stephens bus driver convicted of indecently assaulting a 16-year-old girl told police he was keen to pursue a relationship with the teenager because he thought she "wanted to take it further". Ross Frederick Allen received a one-year suspended jail sentence yesterday after Newcastle Local Court magistrate John Chicken previously found one count of aggravated indecent assault proven. Allen, of Marty Avenue, Salamander Bay, was an upholsterer and driver at Port Stephens Coaches, a police statement said. The company expected to keep Allen on as an upholsterer, a letter tendered to the court stated. Allen was alone with the girl at a home on April 18 last year when he walked up behind her and put his hands on her hips, the court heard. The girl said that Allen then put his hand in her pants and molested her, but Allen told police that he only touched the girl on the hips and any contact in her pants was accidental. He previously pleaded not guilty, but was convicted following a hearing. When asked by detectives during an interview if he wanted to pursue a relationship with the girl, Allen replied: "Oh possibly later on, yeah . . . you know, if she was amenable to it". He also told police that he thought the girl "wanted to take it further". The girl told police she was initially shocked then became upset and told a friend. Police were notified the next day. Mr Chicken said Allen "perceived there was some encouragement from this young lady" and that Allen exercised "very poor judgment". "These types of offences are extraordinarily serious," Mr Chicken said. "They can have significant psychological impacts on the victims." Mr Chicken declined to send Allen to jail because he had good rehabilitation prospects and the offence appeared a "momentary aberration". http://www.theherald.com.au/story/472948/port-stephens-bus-driver-indecently-assaulted-16-y-o-girl/|/images/ross_frederick_allen_2.jpg

The Daily Telegraph (4-12-2009)- "Murder rapist pleads guilty"- A HOMELESS man who held four young international students captive in a Sydney apartment has pleaded guilty to the murder of one woman who plunged to her death from a balcony. In the NSW Supreme Court today, Brendan David Dennison, 26, pleaded guilty to 19 charges, including the murder of an 18-year-old Chinese student and reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm on her 19-year-old Korean boyfriend. He has also pleaded guilty to 10 counts of raping the couple and two other women present at knife-point, and four counts of illegally detaining them.

He had originally been facing 27 charges. Dennison is due to be sentenced on March 9 next year.

BRETT ARMAND DUTTON (Brett Dutton) (NSW - Sydney)|57 yrs old (2010)|Sentenced to 12 months jail - suspended for 12 months.|Brett Dutton- Sydney wine salesman and Former teacher/ boarding house master at Scots PGC College.. Convicted in the Brisbane District Court on September 22 2009 of 3 counts of indecent treatment of a boy under the age of 17, in 1978.. The victim was a boarding student at the time. "Teacher in court again over sexual assault charges" (30-3-2013) A former Warwick teacher has fronted court for the second time for sexually assaulting a student 40 years ago. Teacher turned wine merchant, Brett Armand Dutton, was a teacher and boarding house master at the Scots PGC College in 1978 when he sexually assaulted a 15 year old student. The 60 year old was sentenced for the offences in 2009. But unbeknown to the Director of Public Prosecutions at the time, police were investigating further complaints from a student he was involved with in the early 70s. Dutton fronted Brisbane District Court on Thursday where he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting and indecently treating a grade nine student at Anglican Church Grammar School in Brisbane. The court heard Dutton had taken extended leave from the Queensland Police Service in the 1970s to study at university. Crown prosecutor Ben Power said Dutton took on a role as assistant boarding master at the prestigious boys' college. It emerged 30 years later, when the victim came forward to police, Dutton had masturbated and performed oral sex on a student on school grounds sometime between the end of 1972 and 1974. The court heard Dutton finished his university studies and resigned from the police service. The Sydney resident then worked as a teacher at Scots PGC College in Warwick. Mr Power said Dutton sexually assaulted a 15 year old student in his dorm room. He also kissed the student and touched his genitals on the outside of his clothing while he slept on an excursion to Brisbane. Defence barrister Stephen Zillman said the police knew about the outstanding charges when Dutton was sentenced in 2009 but did not take action. He argued it could have all been dealt with if police had done something about it. "It's by reason of this reaction my client is faced with this terrible position of having to reappear today when unnecessary," Mr Zillman said. The Crown confirmed it was not aware of the pending investigation in 2009. The student victim of Dutton's offending in Brisbane wrote in a victim impact statement he felt no one would believe him and he would be branded a "poofter", Mr Power said. "He could never have told his father," Mr Power said. "His father died in 1997 not ever knowing what happened to his son." Mr Zilmman said his client was young at the time of offending - in his early 20s - and had not offended since. Judge Julie Ryrie said even though the offending was at the lower end of the scale it was still serious. "You did not just leave him alone after counts (offences) one and two, you persisted for a third occasion," she said. Judge Ryrie sentenced Dutton to an 18-month jail term for the sexual assault offences and 12 month jail term for the indecent act charge. Both sentences were suspended. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/teacher-court-again-over-sexual-assault-charges/1810648/ "Sex abuse schoolboy finds attacker using Google" (23-10-2009) A third former teacher has been convicted of sexually abusing students at a private school in Warwick after the man's victim Googled him on the internet.

Co-offender - Robert Clarence Child Couple in court over sex assault- (2-2-2010) THREE members of the gallery were ejected from Grafton Court yesterday during the bail hearings for a couple charged with sexually assaulting a 23-year-old Casino woman over the weekend. Robert Clarence Childs, 39, of South Grafton and Caran Louise Everson, 42, from Mudgee, entered pleas of not guilty to two counts of aggravated indecent assault in company, a charge of detaining a person to obtain advantage in company and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. The court was told Childs and Everson were living together at the Sunset Caravan Park in South Grafton. Childs appeared first before magistrate Kim Pogson. His appearance in court sparked a fiery outburst from the gallery. A woman cried out You nearly killed my daughter. You dog, you dog, and another man yelled an obscenity. The sheriff escorted both from the court room. Solicitor Joe Fahey, representing Childs, entered a plea of not guilty for his client. He said there were aspects of the police account of the victims escape that were open to question. Mr Pogson refused bail to Childs and he was remanded in custody to appear before Grafton Local Court on April 12. Everson appeared next and she was bailed to appear on the same date. Police allege that the couple met the Casino woman at a licensed premises in Casino. The three people went to a caravan park in South Grafton before the man and woman offered to drive the 23-year-old back to her home in Casino later in the evening. As the trio drove towards Casino the 39-year-old man allegedly pulled the car into a camping ground at Lillydale and threatened the Casino woman. The Casino woman was allegedly indecently assaulted before she was able to escape the man and woman by jumping into the nearby Clarence River. The South Grafton man and woman fled the camping ground. The 23-year-old sought help at a nearby home where police and emergency services were contacted. A crime scene was established and police conducted a number of inquiries into the incident. About 12.40pm on Sunday Grafton police arrested the South Grafton man and woman in a car in Grafton. They were taken to Grafton Police Station where they were both charged. http://www.coffscoastadvocate.com.au/story/2010/02/02/court-in-uproar-as-man-and-partner-charged-with-se/

"Activist on bond over sex case" (22-8-1998) Aboriginal activist Gary Foley, 48, was placed on a three-year $1,000 good behaviour bond in the Downing Centre District Court yesterday over an incident of oral sex with a 14-year-old girl following a film premiere 14 years ago. Judge Shillington said he was satisfied that both the girl and Foley, then aged 34, were affected by liquor when they returned from the film to Foley's home in Glebe. Despite differing evidence about who got into bed naked with whom, the judge did not consider it a vital issue. Foley had engaged in oral sex with the girl, whose mother gave evidence that her daughter appeared infatuated with the activist, but did not proceed to full sexual intercourse. The next day the girl had told her mother. The revelation resulted in the breakdown of Foley's then de facto relationship, and also of his close association with the girl's family, Judge Shillington said. The judge directed that Foley, who had pleaded guilty in April, enter into a bond but without any accompanying parole supervision. newsstore.smh.com.au

Victims were 3 boys aged 9-15 yrs old. News (15-3-2011)- Reading out his comments, crown prosecutor Kara Shead said: "Our community has the right to know about the accused so parents can protect their children". Ms Shead also said the public interest in securing the prosecution of offenders who commit such crimes was great, adding that one of the victims came forward only after reading Fox's name in the newspaper- - http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/sydney-developer-admits-paedophile-crimes/story-fn3dxity-1226022022225 News (24-11-2011)- A wealthy property developer who sexually abused three boys he gained access to through a child paedophile ring has been jailed for at least 4 years. Mitchell Bruce Fox, 68, of Northbridge, was part of a child sex ring operating in Sydney in the late 1970s and '80s, which had links to the notorious paedophile Robert "Dolly" Dunn. The Sydney District Court this morning heard Fox, a former partner in a Pink Panther printing business, sexually abused the boys, aged between nine and 15, over a five-year period at his homes in Bellevue Hill and Collaroy and on a boat on Sydney Harbour. Judge Michael King said Fox was introduced to the boys by other members of the ring, including John Thomas Shiel and Phillip Edwards, who had "groomed" the boys to participate in sexual activity with adult men. Judge King said Fox pleaded guilty to seven charges in March this year after his lawyer, in "a desperate last roll of the dice", failed in a bid to have each victim give evidence in a separate trial. Fox often paid Sheil $50 for access to the boys, who had been trained to do sexual acts with men. Judge King rejected a submission from the defence that the victims had consented and did not physically resist, saying the youths had a "warped" view of the world as a result of being groomed by the ring. One victim told police that, by the time he was "pimped" to Fox, "it was normal to me". "For the offender's deviant sexual gratification, these boys were a mere sexual commodity for which he was willing to pay," Judge King said. Fox, who was born in the US and has two daughters, aged 27 and 24, to his first wife, and a 15-year-old son to his second wife, has been in protective custody since April. One of his daughters sobbed loudly as Judge King sentenced Fox to a non-parole period of 4 years, with a maximum sentence of nine years. Fox will be eligible for parole on October 28, 2015. This month, Shiel was sentenced to a minimum 11 years' jail after he pleaded guilty to 54 charges committed between 1978 and 2007, including indecent assault, being an accessory to indecent assault, and 23 charges of buggery. Karen Lindley, from the organisation Bravehearts, said Fox was jailed according to sentencing principals in force at the time of the offences, rather than penalties set under legislation today. "In historical cases we like to see a longer sentence but it's still a fairly big sentence and it goes some way towards the victims feeling that there was justice here today." Ms Lindley said the sentence should encourage other victims of historical sexual abuse to come forward. "The community is saying very strongly that [when it comes to] historical cases, if you offend, you will be bought to trial. "It takes a lot of courage to come forward but, if you have been offended against, people are there to stand behind you and help you get justice." http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/developer-insydney-child-sex-ring-jailed-20111124-1nw3e.html

News (26-3-2012)- "Worst criminals able to reoffend" SOME of Tasmania's worst criminals are reoffending after the court refuses to declare them dangerous criminals a classification that gives judges the power to jail them indefinitely. There are seven declared dangerous criminals in Tasmania, being mostly child abusers and serial rapists. Crown prosecutors recently applied to add violent Hobart home invader Gavin Raymond McIntosh to the list. Beyond Abuse spokesman Steve Fisher said it appeared either the Director of Public Prosecutions was not making enough dangerous prisoner applications to the court or the court was rejecting too many. The Supreme Court in 2003 refused a prosecution application to declare child sex abuser Anthony John Minney, of Launceston, a dangerous criminal, yet he was jailed last September for 14 months after pleading guilty to loitering near children. Minney has a long history of sexually assaulting children and last year asked police to send him to prison. In 2003 Justice Ewan Crawford said Minney's child sex abuse case was ``not sufficiently exceptional'' to justify making a dangerous criminal order. "Seven people (declared dangerous) across the whole of Tasmania does not seem to indicate they are using the tool at their disposal enough, '' Mr Fisher said. "The dangerous criminal register was brought in to serve a purpose and that's to do exactly that to keep them off the street.'' Late last year convicted serial rapist Kevin Richard Bell failed in his bid to have his dangerous criminal order overturned. Bell was sentenced to 12 years' jail in 1991 for six rapes, one indecent assault and four counts of defilement of a young girl. Six months after being paroled in 1998, he committed sex offences against children aged three and 16. Rocherlea man Brendan James Freeman was declared a dangerous criminal in 2004 and sentenced to seven years' jail after admitting to raping and bashing a woman in Launceston. Jamie Gregory McCrossen was placed on the dangerous criminal registry in 1991 after he pleaded guilty to attempting to commit the crime of threatening to murder. Colin John Sparkes (1997) was also placed on the list after being convicted of burglary with intent to rape. Other criminals the DPP has applied to have placed on the dangerous criminal register include Ian John Brumby (2002) who had committed assault, robbery and rape, and serial rapist Paul Vincent Phillips (1998). http://www.theadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/worst-criminals-able-to-reoffend/2500119.aspx

"Serial sex offender kept behind bars" (16-10-2007) Sydney - A serial sex offender who preyed on young boys in NSW, Queensland and South Australia will remain behind bars for another six months. The NSW government applied to extend the jail term of Warren Graeme Hayter for an additional year under tough new laws to keep high-risk child sex offenders behind bars. Hayter, 43, has a lengthy history of serious sexual offences against boys aged between seven and 12 dating back to 1984. He also has admitted committing further offences for which he has not been charged, and has a history of noncompliance with parole, bail and supervision orders. NSW Attorney-General John Hatzistergos applied to keep Hayter in prison, and was granted an interim detention order allowing Hayter to be detained beyond the September 28 expiry of his sentence. Mr Hatzistergos argued Hayter remained at high risk of reoffending and had a record of committing further offences whilst on a good behaviour bond. He was denied access to a custodial sex offenders treatment program for a number of years because he was classified as a high-risk inmate, having previously escaped from jail. Hayter was reclassified and entered the program in January, but he was suspended in August, when a list containing names, descriptions and schools of children taking part in a television program was found in his cell. He admitted the list was "probably about victims of the future", and there also was evidence he was seeking products to counteract anti-libidinal medication, which he has agreed to take. Pictures of young boys were found in his cell the previous month. A number of prison psychologists told NSW Supreme Court Justice John Hislop that Hayter was at high risk of recidivism and needed at least six months further intensive custodial treatment. In his report to the court, Professor David Greenberg said without anti-libidinal medication, Hayter's chance of fairly rapid relapse was "very, very high". Doctor Stephen Allnut's report concluded it was not feasible to safely manage Hayter in the community "without almost constant supervision". Justice Hislop agreed, saying Hayter's acknowledgement last month that he was planning to reoffend when released was ample reason to keep him behind bars. "The defendant has a history of opportunistic offences against young boys, who very often are unknown to him," the judge said. "The offences frequently occur in public places. "It is very difficult, if not impossible, to protect the community from crimes of the nature here in issue, short of having the defendant under full-time physical surveillance." Justice Hislop ordered Hayter remain in custody until April 2008, when he may again apply for release on a supervision order, subject to his completion of the treatment program and stabilisation on anti-libidinal drugs. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/national/serial-sex-offender-kept-behind-bars www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/scjudgments|/images/warren-graeme-hayter.jpg

Jacobs was a CEBS leader at Christ Church, St Ives, and St Swithuns, in Pymble, St Ives, from 1971 to 1981. In 1982 he moved to CEBS at St Swithuns in Pymble but left in 1984. News (4-3-2011)- "Sexual abuse victims tell of despair, anger and death wish"- Four victims who were serially sexually abused as 10- and 11-year-old boys by a church youth group leader told a Sydney court today how he had ruined their lives. One victim said he had attempted suicide at the age of 14 and had struggled all his life to contain a "simmering anger" that lay below the surface. Another said he had attempted suicide twice and had been admitted to hospital five times with severe depression. A third, now aged 42, whose mother read out his statement to the court, said he had struggled with the effects of the abuse for 30 years. "I felt betrayed by a young man I trusted and by an Anglican Church I respected," he said. Today, in the District Court, Sydney management consultant Simon Antony Jacobs, 58, of North Sydney, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the four as boys between 1977 and 1983 when he was an Anglican Church youth group leader in the 1980s. Jacobs pleaded guilty in December to raping and indecently assaulting two other boys who were in his care while he was a leader in the Church of England Anglican Boys Society, or CEBS. Those charges - one count of buggery and three counts of committing an indecent act - related to offences he committed while he supervised the boys. Michael Farrar, barrister for the accused, said his client had led a "blameless life" since the offences were committed "some 30 odd years ago". Jacobs went on to enjoy a long career in management consultancy, working most recently for Forum Asia Pacific in its Sydney office. He was taken into custody today ahead of sentencing on March 23. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sexual-abuse-victims-tell-of-despair-anger-and-death-wish-20110304-1bhdi.html#ixzz1wEdenwWC News (6-12-2010)- A former Anglican Church youth group leader who repeatedly raped a boy, 11, over a two-year period told his victim the assaults were okay because they were not against God's word. Simon Antony Jacobs, 58, from North Sydney, has pleaded guilty to four charges against two boys while he was a leader in the Church of England Boys Society, or CEBS, at two churches on the north shore during the 1970s and 1980s. The charges - one count of buggery and three counts of committing an indecent act - relate to offences committed while he supervised the boys, who were both 11, as a CEBS leader at Christ Church, St Ives, and St Swithuns, in Pymble. Jacobs is also accused of molesting another two boys, both 10, during the same period. The District Court was told on Friday that Jacobs - now a management consultant - raped one of the boys, Victim A, at least twice a month from the beginning of 1978 to the end of 1980 in the downstairs bedroom of Jacobs's parents' home in St Ives. At one point Victim A challenged Jacobs, who was then 25, about what he was doing. "In his Bible studies [the victim] had read that a man and another man should not have sex together," the court heard. "Jacobs told him that it was permissible as they were not making babies." The court was told that Jacobs went to extraordinary lengths to groom his victims, telling them they were special and even shaving Victim A's genitals and legs when he showed signs of puberty. Jacobs also befriended the boys' parents, hosted sleepovers, babysat the boys and their siblings, showered them with gifts, took Victim A to the rugby league at Brookvale Oval and bought ugg boots for Victim B. "[Victim B] and his parents grew to know, like and to trust Jacobs," the court heard. ''Jacobs regularly told the victim that he was a special person and singled him out to do special things from time to time. He also generally paid more attention to him than to the other boys." Jacobs also took nude photographs of both boys, comprising "close-ups and full body shots", the court heard. One photographic session took place when Jacobs took Victim A bushwalking behind Acron Oval, St Ives. Victim B was assaulted while at a CEBS beach camp in 1983. Jacobs forced the boy to share a tent with him and assaulted him. A spokesman for the Anglican Church said Jacobs had worked as a CEBS leader at Christ Church, St Ives, "in various roles" from 1971 to 1981. In 1982 he moved to CEBS at St Swithuns in Pymble but left in 1984. "The record is unclear, but at some point, possibly after leaving Pymble, a note was made that he was not to be issued with a leaders warrant, which he would have required in order to move to leadership in any CEBS group in another parish,'' the spokesman said. Jacobs is due to be sentenced in the District Court on March 4. http://www.smh.com.au/national/church-youth-group-leader-repeatedly-raped-boy-11-20101205-18lep.html|/images/Simon_Jacobs_2.jpg

CASSANDRA LEIGH JOHNSON (NSW)|43 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 24-3-2011, in the NSW District Court, to 8 yrs jail - 5 yrs non parole.|Cassandra Leigh Johnson - found guilty of 21 sex offences involving boys aged 11 and 12 yrs at a NSW school. Cassandra Leigh Johnson jailed for five years for sexually abusing boys at a NSW school- (24-3-2011) A "WICKED terrible woman'' who sexually abused six boys at the NSW school where she worked has been jailed for at least five years. In sentencing the 42-year-old former house mistress today in the NSW District Court, Judge Anthony Garling said the immature and naive boys were in "no position to deal with this predatory Behaviour. The judge earlier this week lifted a non-publication order on naming Cassandra Leigh Johnson who was found guilty in December of 21 sex offences involving boys aged 11 and 12. The 2009 offences included 18 counts of sexual intercourse, involving fellatio and penile vaginal penetration. Judge Garling said he did not take Johnson's gender into account in sentencing, adding he would have sentenced a male offender to the same term. He referred to a victim impact statement by the mother of one of the victims describing Johnson as a "wicked terrible woman'' who was being paid in her job as she was carrying out her sexual offending. The judge set an eight-year maximum term. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/cassandra-leigh-johnson-jailed-for-five-years-for-sexually-abusing-boys-at-a-nsw-school/story-e6freuy9-1226027385910
MURRAY WENDELL JONES (NSW- Griffith, near Sydney)|47 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Murray Wendell Jones/ former Griffith High sports master- pleaded guilty to installing a device and filming for an indecent purpose. News- "Spy's time in jail is cut" Disgraced former Griffith High sports master Murray Jones has had his sentence cut in half after a psychological report indicated glandular fever and work stress contributed to his crime. Dubbed the bathroom spy, Jones fronted the District Court in Griffith on Wednesday, calling for a reduction to the six months periodic detention he received after pleading guilty to installing a device and filming for an indecent purpose. Pointing to a detailed psychological report, his barrister Irving Wallach argued mental health issues had led him to make a monumental error of judgment in setting up a hidden pot plant camera in his bathroom to record a teenager who was living with him at the time. Mr Wallach argued the original sentence had been excessive and called for a good behaviour bond or suspended sentence in its place. However Judge Payne instead chose to reduce the penalty to three months. There were strong mental health issues and this was an absolutely out of character personal judgment, Mr Wallach said. What he did was so far out of his normal character it was extraordinary. The defence counsel also spoke of the penalties Jones had received outside the court, in particular the loss of his 20-year teaching career and widespread public humiliation. Ultimately hes having to move town  to live in Sydney. Hes realised he cant stay in a small town like Griffith, he said. This is a personal tragedy for him. He also said Jones had not housed the young victim in order to prey on him but rather was acting altruistically in assisting the family. Theres no suggestion Mr Jones was a predator  he played an ill advised role in supporting this family, he said. Acting on behalf of the Crown, Gabrielle Steedman said Jones had breached the victims trust. This was a father and son type relationship  and the victim was particularly vulnerable, Ms Steedman said. He held a high moral position and a position of trust. Judge Payne indicated she found the psychological report difficult to swallow. Why would stress lead you to access child pornography?, Judge Payne said. I find it difficult to see the connection between being under stress and engaging in this kind of behaviour. She also expressed shock the teacher was living with the young man and said the community needed to be protected from such behaviour. It beggars belief he would put himself in this situation  he should have known this was a recipe for disaster, she said. This is a very sad case for him. Jones was suspended from Griffith High without pay since he was charged in January and was terminated on March 9 when he pleaded guilty to the offences. He has been placed on a never to be employed again list at the Department of Education and the national child protection register. http://www.riverinamediagroup.com.au/Home/common/printNews.asp?publication=The+Area+News&ArticleID=19982 News (14-3-2007)- "Teacher faces lifetime ban over toilet camera" A Griffith High School teacher in southern New South Wales will never be allowed to teach again after pleading guilty to charges related to a teenage boy finding a hidden camera in his home. The 17-year-old boy reported Murray Wendell Jones, 42, to police in December after finding a small hole in a pot plant in the mans toilet, which contained a camera. An Education Department spokesman says the Griffith teacher has been suspended without pay after pleading guilty to three charges, including filming for an indecent purpose and having a restricted substance, namely sleeping pills, without a prescription. The spokesman says Jones will be placed on a never to be employed list. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-03-14/teacher-faces-lifetime-ban-over-toilet-camera/2216396|/images/murray_wendell_jones_2.jpg

News- "Child sex offender should get 20 years says MP"- A Maclean man convicted of having sex with a child should spend at least 20 years in jail says Clarence MP Steve Cansdell. Mr Cansdell was yesterday scathing of a sentence imposed by the District Court last month that allowed the sex offender to be released back into the community. Ronald Dean King spent 14 months in custody while awaiting sentence on a charge of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10. The 24-year-old admitted entering a house in South Grafton while intoxicated and sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl. The Daily Examiner revealed on Saturday that King received a two year suspended jail sentence, meaning he will only go to prison if he commits further offences in the next two years. Mr Cansdell said he was shocked at the leniency of the sentence, yesterday contacting NSW shadow Attorney General Greg Smith for a crisis meeting. He said Mr Smith agreed the opposition would pressure the Department of Public Prosecutions to appeal the sentence. The courts have once again proved they are completely out of touch with the community, Mr Cansdell said. Crimes against children, particularly those of a sexual nature, deserve the harshest possible punishment. This monster should be locked up in jail and get the punishment he deserves and what the community expects. Mr Cansdell said the case showed the need for lengthy mandatory minimum sentences for child sex offenders.- http://www.dailyexaminer.com.au/story/2009/03/03/20-years-jail-for-child-sex-offender-says-mp/

To be updated.|Takuya Koaze/ Bus Driver, installed a spy camera on a Sydney Transport bus, to film up the skirts of hundreds of schoolgirls. Police discovered more than 2500 photos of girls who appeared to be as young as 10. pleaded guilty to 3 charges of filming without consent. Sydney bus driver who perved on schoolgirls, jailed (15-6-2012) A bus driver who installed a spy camera to film up the skirts of hundreds of schoolgirls will spend at least nine months in jail. Sentencing Takuya Koaze, 48, in the Downing Centre Local Court today, Magistrate Michael Price said he had filmed "many unwitting victims" after he bought a spy camera in Japan and installed it on a Sydney Transport bus. "An aggravating factor clearly has to be (the victims') vulnerability by virtue of their age," Mr Price said, adding it was not an impulsive or isolated event. "This is a serious pattern of criminal behaviour, more particularly because it was planned." Koaze had pleaded guilty to three counts of filming people's private parts to obtain sexual arousal, while working as a bus driver. Police found more than 2500 images and over 60 minutes of footage of girls, some of whom appeared to be as young as 10 or 11. The images focused on the victims' legs, buttocks and genital area. Earlier Koaze told the court he had made a "terrible mistake" and he apologised to his victims. Koaze's mother told the court she continues to support her son and their relationship has grown stronger since the charges were laid. "After this incidence he began to realise that is not a preferable hobby," Setsoko Koaze said. Ms Koaze added that her son had turned to religion and was going to marry. Mr Price said it was clear Koaze, who the court heard has a high IQ, suffered from "some social discomfort". "It's apparent to the court that you regret your actions," he said. He sentenced Koaze to one year's imprisonment with a non-probation period of nine months. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/sydney-bus-driver-filmed-up-skirts-jailed/story-e6freooo-1226396998126|/images/takuya_koaze_2.jpg

In 2012 he admitted sexually abusing two young boys in 1992 and 1997 and was given a 3 year good behaviour bond. News (29-9-2012)- "Bungle allowed paedophile to take care of children" A Paedophile was given parental responsibility for 19 vulnerable Aboriginal children and his organisation handed $5 million in taxpayer funding by the same government department which had classified him as a risk to juveniles years earlier. The chief executive of the Hunter Aboriginal Children's Services, Steven Andrew Larkins, was convicted last month of child sexual assault and fraud charges after he was caught with child pornography. But the Department of Family and Community Services had known that Larkins was a risk to children as he was suspected of sexually abusing a boy in the 1990s when he was a scout leader. Larkins applied for a ''working with children check'' with the department's screening unit in 2003. The allegations meant Larkins was deemed to be ''medium risk'' and was not cleared to work unsupervised with children. Yet he was still able to obtain the powerful position of parental responsibility for 19 children whose care had been given to HACS by the department over nine years. Parental responsibility gave Larkins complete control over the children, including allowing him to take them into his home alone. Larkins was also able to play a prominent role in child protection, including presiding over HACS being given a $5 million boost in taxpayer funding in 2007 to expand the number of children it had care of. This week the department admitted it failed to follow standard procedure and tell the board or any other managers at the Hunter Aboriginal Children's Services (HACS) of its findings. Instead, Larkins alone was informed of his classification, which allowed him to forge a document showing he had obtained clearance to work with unsupervised with children, and which was placed in his personnel file. A spokeswoman for the department said: ''Standard procedure was to send correspondence on the working with children check to the employer and, where the chief executive officer was the applicant, to the board. This was not done in this case. Community Services acknowledges and regrets this error.'' The department also admitted the practice of awarding parental responsibility to an executive of a non-government organisations ''was not usual practice'' and was banned following the Wood special commission of inquiry into the child protection system in 2009. The new chief executive of HACS, Terry Chenery, said Larkins had had access to the children alone and outside of work as a result of being awarded parental responsibility. Mr Chenery said there had been no ''substantiated evidence'' to say that Larkins had inappropriately dealt with children under HACS care. Larkins was exposed last year by a chance incident when a fellow employee found a USB stick containing dozens of child abuse images belonging to Larkins in one of the organisation's cars. A police search of his home found cartoons depicting child pornography on his mobile phone, tablet and computer. An investigation was launched, and Larkins was charged with the aggravated indecent assault of an 11-year-old boy in 1992 and a 12-year-old boy in 1997. Last month Larkins, 46, was convicted and sentenced to at least nine months in jail for four counts of possessing child abuse material. He was given a further 12-month minimum sentence for forging the working with children documents to obtain his $86,000-a-year position and for lying in a statutory declaration, amounting to a total non-parole period of 19 months. The sentence has been stayed pending an appeal, although Larkins is not contesting the three-year good behaviour bond handed down for the assaults on the two boys. The appeal will be mentioned in the Newcastle District Court on November 15.- .|/larkins/steven_andrew_larkins_2.jpg
JAI LEONARD LESLIE (NSW)|21 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 11-1-2012, in the NSW District Court, to 23 yrs 6 mths jail/ 16 yrs 2 mths non-parole. Eligible for release on 7-5-2027.|Abducted and sexually assaulted an 8 yr old girl, in Sydney's west, in Feb 2010. Pleaded guilty in August 2011, to 2 counts of aggravated sexual assault with a person under the age of 10 and to a count of attempted sexual intercourse. News (11-1-2012)- "Rapist jailed for 23 years after abducting girl during friend's sleepover"- A man who abducted an eight-year-old girl from her home in Sydney's west during the night before he raped her in nearby bushland has been jailed for more than 23 years. Jai Leonard Leslie, 21, was today sentenced in the District Court for the abduction and aggravated sexual assault of the girl in February 2010. He pleaded guilty in August last year to two counts of aggravated sexual assault with a person under the age of 10, having inflicted her with actual bodily harm during the attack. He also pleaded guilty to a count of attempted sexual intercourse with the complainant. The eight-year-old, who cannot be identified, had been asleep in the lounge room in the Tregear house with a visiting friend when she awoke during the night to find Leslie sitting near her. She asked him "where's my mum" and the offender said she might have been at a friend's house so suggested the child take a walk with him to find her. The complainant later told police that Leslie "dragged" her by the shirt from the house. A short time later, now holding her hand, he suggested they try to find the girl's mother in nearby bushland - but it was here that the sexual assault began. Leslie told the youngster: "If you don't [comply] I'm going to kill you." After committing two acts of sexual assault on her, Leslie returned her to the property and "told her not to tell her mum", Judge Helen Syme said. The next morning, the child told her mother and sister of the pain she was in. DNA evidence was directly linked to Leslie, who initially denied knowing where he was that night as he had been drinking alcohol heavily and taking drugs. "Well I can't remember much that night so I'm not, not sure if I done it to tell you the truth, 'cause all this stuff's going on and some of the people are making allegations ... I know this, if I done it I can't remember that I've done it but if I've done it then I've done it - and I feel sorry for the little girl too," he told police in a recorded interview. Finally he admitted being in Tregear that night and pleaded guilty. Judge Syme said Leslie used threats or pressure before and after the offence to ensure the victim's compliance, and noted there had been some planning. But she said the immediate "fear, pain and confusion" created by the conduct had led to the serious likelihood of long-term consequences. "A separate and further consequence of the offence is the heightened fear within the community, which rightly expects their children to be safe inside their homes, especially at night," Judge Syme said. "This court is well aware of the potential consequences for children who suffer sexual assault when young - frequently they are serious and life-long." In this child's case, she said the "unchallenged opinion" was that "this child's prognosis of an early recovery is poor". Of equal concern is the "strong evidence of her self esteem being significantly compromised", notwithstanding what the psychologist refers to as a "substantial period of specialised treatment". In handing down the sentence today, Judge Syme said she also took into account a number of other matters, including detaining for advantage and entering a dwelling with intent to commit a serious offence. She sentenced Leslie to an overall jail term of 23 years and six months, with a non-parole period of 16 years and two months. He will be eligible for release on May 7, 2027, but only if he had made "satisfactory progress" on treatment programs in custody. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/rapist-jailed-for-23-years-after-abducting-girl-during-friends-sleepover-20120111-1put1.html#ixzz1jCX5RD58|/images/jai_leslie_1.jpg
JOHN EDWARD LILJESTROM (NSW- Toormina)|53 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 17-3-2010, in the Coffs Harbour District Court, to 18 months in weekend detention at the Grafton Correctional Centre/ 6 months non parole and a 2 yr suspended jail term.|John Edward Liljestrom- Pleaded guilty to charges of using a carriage service to access child pornography and for possession of child pornography. News (18-3-2010)- "Caught with 4427 child porn images" Hetty Johnston, has expressed anger at the leniency of the sentence imposed on a Toormina man caught with thousands of sexually explicit images of children. John Edward Liljestrom, 51, was free to walk from the Coffs Harbour District Court yesterday after admitting he downloaded 4427 images of children, some as young as three, over a two-year period. Sitting Judge Hosking ordered Liljestrom to serve 18 months in weekend detention at the Grafton Correctional Centre, while imposing a two-year suspended jail term should he re-offend. This is a matter of supply and demand, while offenders are downloading these images of children being raped, tortured and abused, they are creating the necessity for this material on the internet, Ms Johnston said. Downloading child pornography is not a victimless crime. I believe the two-strike rule should apply, where the offender is given the benefit of the doubt for the first offence, but if they re-offend again then they should be locked up and the key thrown away. Police raided his Toormina home last February seizing two computer hard drives and a collection of DVDs. Liljestrom told the court he had been fascinated by the material. When interviewed by detectives, he said he was relieved they had caught him. Liljestrom was afforded leniency for an early guilty plea on charges of using a carriage service to access child pornography and for possession of child pornography. In acknowledging the offenders guilt, remorse, disability and troubled childhood, Judge Hosking said he believed the warning to Liljestrom not to re-offend had been seared into his psyche. When he took the stand last week, Liljestrom said he was sorry he had committed the crimes, acknowledging he had created a market for the exploitation of young children. I feel ashamed that I ever thought to observe the photos and save the photos, Liljestrom said. The 51-year-old will serve a minimum parole period of six months with a full term of 18 months. Late yesterday, Liljestroms legal defence Todd Ritchie said the whole matter has been traumatic for John and his family, and one his client hoped to put behind him. Crown prosecutors have 28-days to appeal the sentence. http://www.coffscoastadvocate.com.au/news/child-porn-downloader-gets-leniency/490503/|/images/john_liljestrom_2.jpg

Victims were 12 boys aged from 6 to 11 yrs..offences took place between 2007 and October 2011. Lord worked at a YMCA in southern Sydney, participated in a before-and-after school care program, and worked privately as a babysitter. Childcare worker admits molesting 12 boys- (23-8-2012) An eight-year-old was the main target of a Sydney childcare worker who molested 12 young boys after gaining the confidence of their parents. Jonathan Luke Lord, 25, pleaded guilty to 29 child sex and indecent assault charges in Sydney's Central Local Court on Thursday. One of his victims, the eight-year-old boy, was sexually assaulted twice and was also the victim of seven acts of indecent assault and incitement to commit acts of indecency. Two other charges of sexual intercourse involving the boy were withdrawn on Thursday by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The boy's mother choked back tears after learning of Lord's guilty pleas. "I'm just happy it's over," the woman, who can't be identified for legal reasons, told AAP. She said her son was "doing okay" and her family was coping well. Lord pleaded guilty to the offences on 12 boys aged from six to 11 that took place between 2007 and October 2011. He worked at a YMCA in southern Sydney, participated in a before-and-after school care program and worked privately as a babysitter. He allegedly put his hands inside one boy's pants and asked, "Does that feel nice?", documents previously tendered to the court state. Lord appeared via audio-visual link and wept when pleading guilty to the charges, saying "Yes, your honour". A woman who had children under his care, but were not among those molested, also burst into tears. Police said Lord was in a "highly trusted position" and abused his roles as professional childcare worker and babysitter. "The accused has on all occasions groomed the complainants and their families to earn their trust," previously tendered court documents state. "Investigators will submit that this behaviour is predatory and premeditated in nature." A YMCA spokesmen and Lord's mother, Jill Yankos, declined to comment on Thursday's court proceedings. Ms Yankos is married to soccer legend Charlie Yankos, who captained the Socceroos in the 1980s. Lord will remain in custody until he appears in Downing Centre District Court on August 31 for sentencing. A spokesman said the YMCA was devastated by the nature of the charges relating to a former employee. "Our focus remains, as always, on the families and children who have been affected," he said in a statement to AAP. "We would like to reassure our families and the community that from the moment we became aware of the allegations we took immediate action by following mandatory reporting procedures, immediately standing him down and working with NSW Police to ensure the proceedings were not affected." http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/childcare-worker-admits-molesting-12-boys-20120823-24oo0.html

Judge Laura Wells said she found it difficult to accept that people who viewed such material could experience anything other than revulsion or sexual gratification. She sentenced Errol Francis Mayo, 59, of Macquarie Street, to two years and four months' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 months. With time served, he will be eligible for release in May. Of the 544 images, 19 were in the worst category while 32 of the 70 short movies that were found on the computer were in the second-worst category of child pornography, Newcastle District Court heard. Mayo was caught by his wife viewing some of the images in June 2009, Judge Wells said. The wife went to the police without telling Mayo, and allowed officers to seize the computer so it could be analysed. http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/prison-for-man-over-child-porn/2072973.aspx

ANDREW DEAN MCINTOSH (NSW)|53 yrs old (2011)|To be updated. Found guilty 27-5-2011 in the NSW Supreme Court of child sex offences. Back in court 18-7-2011.|Victims were boys. News AAP 27-5-2011..'Evil' NSW man convicted of child sex abuse. A MAN who flogged a boy with a kettle cord and feather duster has been found guilty of sexually abusing three boys in NSW in the 1980s. Andrew Dean McIntosh, 53, was convicted today of 18 offences, including buggery and indecent assault, between 1979 and 1984. Women and men, including one victim, wept in the public gallery as the jury returned its verdict in the NSW Supreme Court. During the trial, which began in April, the court was told McIntosh stalked and groomed his victims, and assaulted them sexually and physically. He befriended the boys' families to form relationships with them, the crown said. One victim who gave evidence at the trial said McIntosh threatened to blow up his family if he told anyone about the attacks. He said he had been whipped by McIntosh up to 10 times with a kettle cord after refusing him sex. The boy told the court McIntosh also beat him with a feather duster, had non-consensual sex with him and would regularly "masturbate us simultaneously". Today, one of the victims said he was relieved at the verdict and labelled McIntosh "evil". McIntosh showed no emotion as the jury delivered its verdict. The jurors were told afterwards that he had been convicted of similar offences in 1988 and 2009. The case was adjourned to July 18 and McIntosh will be sentenced at a later date. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/evil-nsw-man-convicted-of-child-sex-abuse/story-e6frfku0-1226064116624|/images/andrew_dean_mcintosh_2.jpg

Fake immigration officer pleads guilty to Hyde Park sex assault- (25-6-2012) A man who posed as an immigration officer and indecently assaulted a young woman in Sydney's Hyde Park has pleaded guilty to the offence. Pierre Elias Mikhail, 24, today admitted to taking and detaining a person with intent to obtain a sexual advantage on October 14, 2010. Mikhail, from Sylvania, in Sydney's south, was arrested at Sydney airport in November 2010 shortly before his Lebanon-bound plane was due to take off. Mikhail's victim, a 26-year-old international student from Ecuador, was attacked while walking along Liverpool Street after he approached her and pretended to be an immigration officer, the court heard previously. She was handcuffed and assaulted, before managing to escape about an hour later. Judge Ronald Solomon noted in Sydney District Court today that Mikhail had a prior conviction for sexual assault and had been on a good behaviour bond at the time of the incident. "He does face a lengthy custodial sentence," Judge Solomon said, adding that Mikhail posed a flight risk. He refused bail and adjourned the matter for a sentence hearing on September 14. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/fake-immigration-officer-pleads-guilty-to-hyde-park-sex-assault-20120625-20xmp.html#ixzz1zALTuMEQ
DAVID FREDERICK MILLER (VIC-Bendigo... NSW- Sydney, South Coogee- May 2007)|68 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced May 2007, in the Bendigo County Court, to 3 yrs jail - 30 months suspended for 2.5 yrs.|David Frederick Miller- Former Bendigo doctor..pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl in 1977, a woman aged 18 or 19 in 1979 and a 16-year-old girl in 1980.. Miller was also sentenced in December, 1983, to 15 months' jail, which was suspended after he served eight months, for indecently assaulting a 13-year-old patient. News (12-5-2007)- "Ex-GP to serve six months jail" A FORMER Bendigo doctor was jailed for six months yesterday for indecently assaulting three teenagers during internal examinations at an Arnold Street clinic. David Frederick Miller, 63, tutted loudly as Judge Pamela Jenkins sentenced him in Bendigo County Court to a total of three years' imprisonment, 30 months of which she suspended for two-and-a-half years. Supporting himself with a walking stick, the pensioner appeared visibly shaken as a policeman led him away. Miller pleaded guilty on Thursday to indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl in 1977, a woman aged 18 or 19 in 1979 and a 16-year-old girl in 1980 when he was working as a medical practitioner at the Arnold Street Medical Clinic. Judge Jenkins said immediate imprisonment was the only appropriate sentence. 'As a medical practitioner, you were in a position of trust and authority, which you grossly abused,'' she said. Miller was sentenced in December, 1983, to 15 months' jail, which was suspended after he served eight months, for indecently assaulting a 13-year-old patient. Despite Miller's guilty plea, Judge Jenkins said the former army reserves medical officer lacked remorse and had denied his victims' allegations during his police interview. The judge also said the women had to go through the trauma of giving evidence at Miller's committal hearings. The victim impact statements tendered on behalf of each of your victims each demonstrated the profound adverse effect that your offending had on each of them,'' Judge Jenkins said. The judge told Miller the cases of two of the women were aggravated by the fact that Miller knew they had already been sexually abused when he indecently assaulted them. Miller not only abused his position by taking advantage of the vulnerable patients, he compounded the abuse, Judge Jenkins said. She said victim impact statements tendered to the court showed they had experienced relationship difficulties, a lack of self-esteem and trust in others and had had to have counselling for long periods. The judge noted one of the women was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Judge Jenkins said the difficulty the women had in trusting doctors and attending medical clinics because of Miller's offending could have serious ramifications. She placed the father-of-five on the sex offenders register. Judge Jenkins recommended assessment for Miller to get treatment on sexual offender programs, particularly in regards to minors. The judge also made an order for police to take a swab sample from Miller, who was living in a housing commission house in South Coogee, Sydney, until yesterday. Judge Jenkins reiterated the point she made on Thursday that had Miller committed the offences after changes to the legislation, he would have been charged with more serious offences. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/679361/ex-gp-to-serve-six-months-jail/ http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/679344/ex-doctor-admits-indecent-assaults-on-three-teenagers/|/images/david_frederick_miller_2.jpg

Man jailed over rape at train station- (29-6-2012) A Sydney man has been jailed for up to 11 years for repeatedly raping an 18-year-old woman as she slept at an inner-city railway station and filming it on his phone. AVINESHWAR Nand had carried on the attack despite several train passengers walking past, the NSW District Court was told. Nand bowed his head slightly and covered his face as the sentence was read out in the court on Friday. The 40-year-old from Quakers Hill, in the city's northwest, began the predatory attack after spotting the young woman sleeping on a bench at Newtown railway station during the early hours of December 16, 2010. The woman, who has not been named for legal reasons, had drunk alcohol the night before and had not slept for several days because of a bout of insomnia. Nand took advantage of her deep slumber and raped her several times, filming the entire ordeal on his iPhone. The film, later found by police, and CCTV footage from the station played a key role in the case. It was revealed in court that Nand was on parole at the time of the attack and had previously broken into homes in 2004 and 2006 and indecently assaulted two women inside. Nand also had convictions for assault, drugs offences and aggravated break and enter. He admitted the 2010 attack only in January this year, just days before a trial was due to get underway. He pleaded guilty to sexual assault and rape, sparing the victim the ordeal of giving evidence in court. He was also convicted of possessing a small amount of cannabis. Nand will serve a minimum of seven and a half years in jail. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/national/man-jailed-over-rape-at-train-station/story-e6frfku9-1226412062314#ixzz1z8zMOsiu http://blacktown-advocate.whereilive.com.au/news/story/quakers-hill-rapist-jailed/

He attacked an 11 yr old girl, after grabbing her from a laneway in Oakleigh, on October 13, 1977. News (11-12-2006)- "'Santa' child sex attacker jailed" A man who sexually assaulted a child in Melbourne 29 years ago only to be caught last year after applying for a job as Santa Claus has been jailed for a minimum of 15 months. Raymond Wayne O'Brien, 51, will be eligible for parole next year, having already served 216 days in custody. O'Brien was initially charged in November 1977, but gave police a false name and fled to NSW. He was caught when he applied for a job as a Santa in 2005. The victim, who cannot be identified, said she was "very happy" with the sentence, even though Judge Michael Bourke said many would take the view that the length of the jail term imposed on O'Brien did not reflect the gravity of the crimes. Judge Bourke sentenced O'Brien to a maximum of three years and six months in jail, adding he was constrained by the maximum sentence, which in 1977 was five years. "At the end of the day, what I wanted was for him to be on the sex offenders' list," the victim told reporters outside court. "He got more than what I expected." Judge Bourke said the behaviour displayed by O'Brien - who pleaded guilty in the County Court to three counts of indecent assault last month - would "revolt any decent person". "She lost her innocence and was then insulted and humiliated," he said. O'Brien attacked the girl, then aged 11, after grabbing her from a laneway in Oakleigh, on October 13, 1977. Repeatedly threatening to break her neck, he assaulted her three times. Forcing her to take $2.30 after the ordeal, O'Brien told the girl she would be called a prostitute if she went to the police. O'Brien's lawyer, Stewart Bayles, earlier told the court that while his client had admitted most of the offences to police, he no longer remembered the attack because he was a chronic alcoholic at the time. But Judge Bourke said: "Your intoxication does not reduce the level of your moral culpability, which was significantly high." Judge Bourke told the victim he "greatly admired" her courage and dignity that she showed throughout the court case. "I wish you the very best for the rest of your life," he said. http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/santa-child-sex-attacker-jailed/2006/12/11/1165685594280.html

News- "Persons of interest named in murdered girl's inquest"- A BLOOD-stained piece of rough-sawn timber found in thick scrub near a secluded beach camp site is believed to be the weapon used to murder teenager Lee Ellen Stace, an inquest into her death heard yesterday. Police found the piece of wood, which also had hairs on it, on the edge of the camping area at Red Cliff, on the North Coast, where the 16-year-old's remains were discovered scattered in sand dunes in October 1997. The teen, described as shy by her parents, Peter and Robyn Stace, had vanished six weeks before while hitch-hiking home from her part-time job at Bi-Lo in Yamba.

News (6-12-2007)- A woman involved in home-made porn films with two 14-year-old Adelaide girls has been found guilty of criminal offences. Rebecca Jane Clarke, of Goulburn in NSW, was found by a South Australian District Court judge to have incited the teenaged girls to perform sex acts. The 23-year-old also was found guilty of producing child pornography by Judge Michael Boylan. Clarke had pleaded not guilty to charges of inciting a child to commit an indecent act and producing child pornography, telling her trial she believed the girls were 17-years-old. Clarke was one of three people charged over the filming of six home-made pornographic films between July 2005 and February last year. Her co-accused - Daniel Troy Osis, 25, and Renee Jean Malyschko, 23 - were tried separately and pleaded guilty in June this year to having unlawful sexual intercourse with the two 14-year-old girls. Osis and Malyschko also pleaded guilty to two counts each of inciting a child to commit an indecent act and producing child pornography, while Osis was convicted of two further counts of possessing child pornography. Both have yet to be sentenced. Judge Boylan found Clarke guilty on Thursday despite saying she "honestly and, indeed, reasonably believed the two girls were 17". "I'm of the view that does not matter given the gravity of the offence," Judge Boylan said. Sentencing submissions for Clarke will be held in January next year. http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=333008

JUNG HU PARK ( NSW/ Korean national)|23 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Jung Hu Park/ Korean student-broke into a woman's room armed with a knife and rope, and raped her. Pleaded guilty to 2 charges of inflicting actual bodily harm,while having sexual intercourse without consent. Rapist was depressed: psychiatrist- (26-2-2011) A Korean student's depression contributed to his sickening rape of a Figtree woman but not to the extent that he was unaware of what he was doing, a court has heard. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Stephen Allnutt yesterday told Wollongong District Court that Korean national Jung Hu Park, 22, was strongly driven by emotion when he broke into the woman's room on February 27 last year, armed with a knife and rope. Threatening to kill her if she screamed, Park tied the woman's hands to her neck before sexually assaulting and raping her. He also taunted her through the prolonged attack by reading a pre-prepared list of reasons why he wanted to kill her, but said he would give her tips on how to survive because he loved her. Park videotaped the ordeal, threatening to post it online and send it to her family and friends if she spoke out about the attack. He pleaded guilty to two charges of inflicting actual bodily harm on the woman while having sexual intercourse without consent. During a sentencing hearing yesterday, Dr Allnutt said there was some connection between Park's depression and the offence, and while his illness did not amount to psychosis, it did affect his judgment. Defence barrister James Trevallion described his client as a particularly young and naive man who was culturally isolated. "He has no access to other Korean people in custody, no family or friends close by ..." Mr Trevallion said. When questioned in the witness box, Park said he understood what he did was wrong and that he had hurt the woman. Director of Public Prosecutions lawyer Kristy Spiers said there were a number of aggravating features in the case, including the presence of a knife, the death threats, duration of the attack and the degree of planning involved. She also said the multiple sexual acts further degraded and humiliated the victim. Judge Paul Conlon reserved his judgment until April 15. http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/rapist-was-depressed-psychiatrist/2087597.aspx

"Satanist Daniel William Peckham lured girls into Rookwood cemetery for sex" (4-12-2009) A satanist who preyed on young girls, luring them to a Sydney cemetery for sex through a fake online gothic society, has been sentenced to nine years' jail. As a condition of membership to the "Rookwood Gothic Society," Daniel William Peckham, 24, required teenage girls to send naked photographs of themselves and be prepared to have sex with him. He convinced at least two girls to meet him in the grounds of Rookwood cemetery at night, where he kissed and touched them before trying to persuade them to have sex. At his sentencing hearing, a girl he sexually assaulted in an open tomb in April 2007 told the District Court in a victim's impact statement she felt the attack was her fault. She said her school grades have suffered greatly and she now has trouble trusting people. "At the time...it felt like what was happening was my fault and everything was what I deserved," she said. The girl, who was 15 when the assault took place, said she began self-harming by cutting her legs and arms and she became "obsessed" with talking to people on the internet because she "could pretend to be someone else." The court heard Peckham had asked her to have sex with him previously and when she refused, he posted a video of her naked on You Tube as "punishment." Judge Peter Berman said it was disturbing how easily "young, naive girls can be persuaded to act in such a way by a person prepared to manipulate them for his own sexual gratification." Peckham pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault, three counts for each of three victims of using the internet to procure underage girls for sexual activity and transmitting child pornography. He also admitted using the internet to menace one of the girls and two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice by asking two girls to hide his stored images of child pornography. Judge Berman sentenced him to nine years jail with six years non-parole. With time already served, he will be eligible for release in June, 2013. http://www.news.com.au/national-old/satanist-daniel-william-peckham-lured-girls-into-rookwood-cemetery-for-sex/story-e6frfkvr-1225806998428

RODNEY PHIPPS (NSW)|39 yrs old (2007)|Sentenced in the District Court for 14 years jail.|Rodney Phipps - Paedophile-16 separate counts of sexual assault. "Stepfather: daughter a sex slave" (27-5-2007) A teenage schoolgirl was forced to become a sex slave for four years by her violent, controlling stepfather, a Sydney court has heard. The stepfather, whom a judge described as "manipulative'', exploited the girl's fears for her mother's and sisters' safety to ensure she never reported his vile attacks on her. The extraordinary story of the young woman's five-year fight for justice emerged last week after Rodney Phipps, 39, was jailed in the District Court for 14 years on 16 separate counts of sexual assault. The young victim persuaded the judge to remove a court suppression order so her boastful, self-obsessed tormentor could be publicly named. Judge John Goldring said he wanted "to send a message to all stepfathers that this type of behaviour will be severely punished by the courts''. He said Phipps, a former soldier and mobile phone salesman, was lucky his crimes had been committed before the maximum jail term for such offences had been doubled to 20 years. The judge said Phipps' crimes amounted to ``the worst type of sexual servitude''. He said Phipps had ``manipulated his stepdaughter to become his sexual slave''. In an exclusive interview, she told The Sunday Telegraph she wanted to show other young women caught in a similar sexual trap that they could escape from such nightmares. "I wanted people to know about this sort of crime - so many people just don't know about it,'' Lois (not her real name) said. "Only five or six per cent of these people get caught and sentenced. It's also good to know the justice system does work sometimes''. Shortly after Phipps moved into Lois's life, as her mum's de facto, his charming salesman's veneer began to slip, exposing a cunning and violent side. One day, when no one else was at home at their western Sydney address, Phipps came into her bedroom and sexually assaulted the then 12-year-old. He threatened violence if she told anyone and she had already seen what he did to her mother, the court heard. Later, he exploited different fears: he said he wouldn't hurt her mum any more nor "do it to my sisters'', if she went along with his assaults. According to Lois, Phipps controlled her life and all their lives. He forced her older sisters to leave home; he forced her to leave school. According to the girl's victim impact statement, Phipps later started to bribe her. At times he allowed her requests as long as she agreed to have sex with him. Her mother was on shift work, her older sisters had moved out, the younger children were asleep. Later, she came to think that she was in a relationship with the man more than twice her age. "Phipps always used to tell me: `No one will love you like I do. Boys your age will just use you','' she said, in her victim impact statement. Judge Goldring noted: "The offender was the only father figure in the victim's life and she had no other father figure. "This relationship evolved into an emotion-dependency relationship - the worst type of sexual servitude.'' He added: "Dependency of this type is not uncommon''. Judge Goldring said it was not in dispute that Phipps and the then 16-year-old Lois later "intended to live together'', such was his control over her. "The offender had manipulated his stepdaughter to become his sexual slave,'' he said. After Phipps was jailed briefly over other matters, he wrote 19 "telling'' letters to Lois. Her mother intercepted one and, horrified by its contents, urged Lois to speak to the police. She resisted at first but eventually agreed. Then came a four-year wait, a delay while Phipps pursued a range of legal options, including seeking to be excused from being charged because he was not mentally fit to stand trial. For Lois and other witnesses, it meant four years of not discussing the case with each other, for fear that these talks might "taint'' their evidence in the trial; and four years of putting up with the frustration of repeated adjournments. In her victim impact statement to the court, Lois wrote: "I feel I have missed out on my childhood. I was not allowed out with friends, not allowed to have a boyfriend, he made me stay at home ...'' Now that chapter is over and she said last week: "I can finally start my life again''. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/stepfather-daughter-a-sex-slave/story-e6frewt0-1111113618250|/images/rodney_phipps_2.jpg
TONY PISCITELLI (NSW- Tuross Head)|25 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced Feb 2011, to 16.5 yrs jail - 11.5 yrs non parole/ with time already served he will be eligible for parole in October, 2021.|Tony Piscitelli/ Tuross Head rapist-viciously raped an 83 yr old woman in her Tuross Head home in April, 2010. Pleaded guilty to 2 counts of aggravated sexual intercourse occasioning actual bodily harm, one charge of special aggravation break, enter and committing a serious indictable offence and a further sexual assault charge. Tuross Head rapist leaves legacy of fear- (18-2-2011) An undercurrent of fear still exists in the Tuross Head community, despite this weeks jailing of a savage rapist. Tony Piscitelli, 24, was sentenced on Monday to 16-and-a-half-years jail for the vicious rape of an 83-year-old woman in her Tuross Head home last April. The savage and callous attack was almost in the worst case category of aggravated sexual assault, according to Wollongong District Court Judge David Frearson. The sentence came as a relief for many Tuross residents, most of whom were happy to close the chapter and move on. However, speaking to the Bay Post/Moruya Examiner, some said there was still an undercurrent of fear and nervous tension, felt particularly by the villages many elderly residents. I never thought that it would happen here, in Tuross, one woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, said. I moved here with mum in 86 and you could walk the streets at night with no problems. Not now, there are too many louts and loons about at night. A few streets over, another man said, despite feeling no personal danger, his elderly neighbours were constantly afraid. We didnt have any (street) lights along here until recently, he said. Thats made a huge difference. They come out of the pubs and walk this way, yelling and making noises. The police are too far away, and the old ones are too afraid to speak out. Im not though, I come out and yell at them, get them to move on. The general consensus was that Tuross needs a stronger police presence. With the closest 24-hour police station at Batemans Bay - 40 minutes away - residents still feel vulnerable. People who didnt lock their doors before (the attack) probably do now, and thats not a bad thing, another woman said. But it would be a great weight off the minds of many if Tuross had its own police station. These problems arent going away, something has to be done. http://www.batemansbaypost.com.au/news/local/news/general/tuross-head-rapist-leaves-legacy-of-fear/2079720.aspx Savage rapist behind bars- (16-2-2011) A Tuross Head man who raped an 83-year-old woman and repeatedly slammed her head against a wall during a drug and booze-fuelled attack will spend more than 10 years behind bars. Tony Piscitelli, 24, was sentenced to a total of 16-and-a-half years jail for the vicious attack on the elderly woman in April last year. Wollongong District Court Judge David Frearson this week described Mr Piscitellis actions as a savage and callous attack that was almost in the worst case category of aggravated sexual assault. Mr Piscitelli pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse occasioning actual bodily harm, one charge of special aggravation break, enter and committing a serious indictable offence and a further sexual assault charge. He admitted he broke into the womans Tuross Head unit in April last year and, upon discovering her alone in the bathroom, put a hand over her mouth and said: Dont make noise, Im not going to hurt you. However, Mr Piscitelli then pulled the woman into the bedroom and raped her twice, despite her repeated pleas for him to stop. During the ordeal he told her he had a knife, and at another time, asked her if she was enjoying it. When he was finished, Mr Piscitelli made the woman sit against a brick wall before he slammed her head against it four to five times. The court heard the woman, who suffered from asthma, was also having trouble breathing and asked Mr Piscitelli to get her puffer when he finally stopped. He left the room but did not return, and soon after the woman alerted neighbours, who contacted police. Mr Piscitelli told the court during sentencing submissions last Friday that he consumed seven or eight beers, smoked 15 cones of cannabis and had two sleeping tablets before the incident and did not remember much of it. He initially denied knowledge of the crime when spoken to by police, however conceded his involvement when DNA swabs pinned him as the rapist. Judge Frearson said Mr Piscitellis record showed numerous convictions for dishonesty and assault. He also acknowledged Mr Piscitelli began using illicit drugs at 10 and was himself sexually assaulted at age 12. Judge Frearson acknowledged that Mr Piscitelli accepted responsibility for his crimes and was remorseful and ashamed, but said it didnt excuse his actions. The victim impact statement was extremely distressing ... The victim was frail and vulnerable, Judge Frearson said. Piscitellis non-parole period of 11 and a half years includes one year of time already served. He will be eligible for parole in October, 2021. http://www.batemansbaypost.com.au/news/local/news/general/savage-rapist-behind-bars/2076898.aspx

Found guilty of 5 charges- Victims were 3 Nepalese boys aged 13 and 14. Also found guilty of possessing child pornography. Child Wise (16-11-2010)- "Outrage at sentence of predatory sex offender"- Child Wise, Australias leading international child protection charity are outraged at the 15 month jail term handed down to convicted Australian child sex tourist Geoffrey John Prigge. On 12 November, Geoffrey Prigge, 55 of Mosman, was the first Australian convicted of child sex tourism offences in Nepal. At the trial at the District Court in Sydney, Prigge was found guilty of five charges related to indecent touching and attempted acts of indecency involving three Nepalese boys aged 13 and 14. Prigge was also found guilty of possessing child pornography in his home in Mosman. Prigge reportedly helped to set up an orphanage in Nepal and was known as a "man of charity". The offences were part of a "careful grooming process" that started when he visited Nepal on a previous occasion and took indecent photographs of boys. Returning to Nepal in 2007, he committed the offences as he showed the victims indecent pictures and a pornographic film in his hotel room. http://www.childwise.net/images/stories/documents/Media_releases/Geoffrey_John_Prigge_16_November_2010.pdf News (15-11-2010)- "Nepal charity work hid predator's sex abuse of children"- He helped set up an orphanage in Nepal and was known as a "man of charity". But there was a darker side to Geoffrey John Prigge's interest in children, said the judge who jailed him for molesting teenage boys. Prigge, 55, of Mosman, was the first Australian convicted of child sex-tourism offences committed while in Nepal. He was charged under legislation allowing Australians who offend overseas to be investigated by the Australian Federal Police and prosecuted at home. At his trial in the District Court in Sydney, a jury found him guilty of five charges related to indecent touching and attempted acts of indecency involving three Nepalese boys aged 13 and 14. He also pleaded guilty to the possession of child pornography at his home in Mosman. Sentencing him on Friday, Judge John Nicholson said that to his friends and relatives, Prigge was community-oriented and gregarious, but "to three Nepalese boys  he presented as a predatory, manipulative paedophile". The offences were part of a "careful grooming process" that began on an earlier visit to Nepal when Prigge, a photographer and charity worker, took indecent photographs of boys, the judge said. Returning in 2007, he committed the offences as he showed the victims indecent pictures and a pornographic film in his hotel room. The court was told the Nepalese appreciate the value of tourism. Judge Nicholson said the boys, who came to Sydney to give evidence, sought to welcome Prigge and downplay his sexual interest in them to accommodate a foreign visitor. The difference in the financial status of tourists from a First-World country and the local population helped create a "tidal wave of power abuse", the judge said, adding that Prigge's crimes were "a serious abuse of power". The federal police's national co-ordinator of child protection operations, Alison Wegg, said that even abroad, Australians were not beyond the reach of federal law. Intervening before children are harmed is a key strategy for the federal police, who can cancel the passports of suspected child sex tourists. Under new laws, planning a child sex-tourism offence or grooming or procuring a child for sexual activity overseas is punishable by up to 15 years in jail. Prigge will serve 15 months behind bars, to be released in February 2012. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/nepal-charity-work-hid-predators-sex-abuse-of-children-20101114-17sq2.html|/images/Geoffrey_Prigge_2.jpg

Jail for child porn offender Save (22-11-2012) A child pornography offender caught in a nationwide Australian Federal Police investigation has been sentenced to jail in Dubbo District Court. Adam William Quelch, aged 40, was one of 11 people arrested in June last year. The court heard computers and external hard drives were seized from the home Quelch shared with his wife and children when police raided a sheep, cattle and cropping property located midway between Narrabri and Bingara. The raid followed the detection of online activity by a covert police team in Canberra. Quelch was prosecuted under state and Commonwealth child abuse legislation. Guilty pleas were entered to charges of accessing, possessing, disseminating and making available child pornography. The charges related to thousands of images of children, aged from one to 17 years. Judge Gordon Lerve was told the bulk of the images were of pre-pubescent children. Quelch was charged with seven counts of bestiality, involving dogs and horses, after investigators found computer images of sexual acts with animals. The court heard the bestiality offences, described in a psychiatrist's report as zoophilia, occurred on the family property "at different times of the day" across more than seven years. The bestiality charges were dismissed by the court. Judge Lerve handed down a series of jail sentences, to date from July 23 last year. The sentences totalled five years and five months. A non-parole period of 24 months was set. Quelch has been on remand in jail since August 10 last year.

John Thomas Shiel, a member of the infamous Robert "Dolly" Dunn paedophile ring, cunningly and systematically ensnared six young boys, building up trust with them and their families before sexually assaulting them. The court heard that Shiel, 62, targeted boys whose families were in financial difficulty or had suffered a recent tragedy, including three young brothers whose father was struggling to look after them because their mother had just died. He would approach them at suburban Sydney swimming pools or fetes, often using his existing victims to draw them in, and then shower them with gifts and activities that their families would never be able to afford, such as trips to theme parks and motorcycle speedways. Having cleverly won the trust of the victims and their families families Shiel would offer to look after them for a weekend, or take them away for a "holiday" at surfers paradise. During these trips he would rape the boys and then, as the months progressed, prostitute them to the other members of the paedophile ring, such as Robert "Dolly" Dunn and the Northbridge property developer Mitchell Fox, who has pleaded guilty to seven charges. The boys were instructed about how to behave around the other members of the ring, and to help Shiel ensnare other young victims that appealed to his tastes. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/notorious-paedophile-jailed-20111117-1nkvu.html News (13-10-2011) http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/pedophile-supplied-kids-to-dolly-dunn/story-e6frfku0-1226166116028

Man jailed for rape of teenager (31-1-2013) A man who raped a 14-year-old girl on the Newcastle Foreshore with another man was jailed for more than seven years yesterday while his accomplice remains on the run. Luke Skuthorpe, 26, had been released on parole only two weeks before he lured the girl from Newcastle train station on January 1, 2012, to an area near Customs House, Judge Peter Berman said. The girl was so drunk she could barely stand, but she tried to stop Skuthorpe from kissing and fondling her, the court heard. He led her to an area in the park, put her on the ground and removed some of her clothes while she resisted. He and the other man raped the girl telling her, You love this, youre loving this, before leaving her lying on the ground. She eventually found her clothes and got help before attending John Hunter Hospital. Skuthorpe, formerly of Newcastle, was arrested last March and initially denied having sex with the girl. When police told him they had extracted his DNA from the girl he admitted performing an act on her, but when informed they had extracted his semen from the girl he still maintained he hadnt had sex with her. Skuthorpe waited until the day of his trial to plead guilty to aggravated sexual assault. Judge Berman jailed him for seven years and six months with a non-parole period of five years. Skuthorpe will be eligible for parole in March 2017. Skuthorpe was given a discount on his sentence for telling Newcastle District Court how the other man took part in the rape. http://www.theherald.com.au/story/1272017/man-jailed-for-rape-of-teenager/?cs=305

PETER KEVIN SMITH (NSW- Newcastle)|25 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced May 2011, in the District Court, to 22 yrs jail - 16.5 yrs non parole.|Smith slit a 13 year old girl's throat before sexually assaulting her, at a Jesmond shopping centre on 17-10-2010. Pleaded guilty in Newcastle Local Court to attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault and armed robbery. News (17-2-2011)- "Offender sexually assaulted 13-year-old girl Slit throat: guilty plea"- A MAN who slit a 13-year-old girl's throat before sexually assaulting her at a Jesmond shopping centre pleaded guilty to attempted murder yesterday. When police informed Peter Kevin Smith of his victim's age, Smith replied: "Was she really only 13 . . .? That's f-Ed," a police statement said. The girl suffered a 12-centimetre cut to her throat, but was not expected to experience any long-term problems with the wound, the statement said. Smith, 25, whose address was given as both Maitland and Muswellbrook, pleaded guilty in Newcastle Local Court to attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault and armed robbery. He will face Newcastle District Court next week when a sentence date will be set. Several hours before he attacked the girl on October 17 last year, Smith held a knife to a woman's throat in the underground car park of Maitland District Leagues Club while she was getting her baby daughter out of a car. Smith approached her from behind and yanked her head back by pulling her hair. He did so with such force that she fell, a police statement said. She was able to run away with her daughter in a pram while Smith searched her car and stole her handbag. He then travelled to Stockland Shopping Centre, Jesmond, where he forced the 13-year-old girl to the back of a shop and slit her throat with a carving knife. He then groped her breasts and put his hand in her pants and sexually assaulted her. The girl told police she thought she was going to die. She was able to escape with blood pouring down her. Smith was arrested at Telarah train station at 12.15am on October 18. http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/offender-sexually-assaulted-13yearold-girl-slit-throat-guilty-plea/2078658.aspx News (19-10-2010)- "No bail in alleged knifing, sexual assault and robbery"- Within just nine minutes, a man is alleged to have attacked and tried to kill a teenage girl in a Jesmond shopping centre, sexually assaulting her before slashing her throat with a knife so badly it damaged her trachea. Court papers state that the 13-year-old victim was attacked at the Blue Gum Road centre between 5.11pm and 5.20pm on Sunday  less than seven hours after the same man is accused of threatening a woman with a knife while she was strapping her baby into a pram in a Maitland car park. The girl had surgery and remained in John Hunter Childrens Hospital last night, where her condition was not being released, although medical staff have told police the injuries to her throat had damaged her trachea and were millimetres from causing major damage. Peter Smith, a 25-year-old whose address was listed in court papers only as being at Maitland, faces six charges relating to the separate attacks including the attempted murder and aggravated sexual assault of the teenager. Barefoot and wearing plastic white overalls, Mr Smith spent less than three minutes in the dock of Maitland Local Court yesterday before being led away by Department of Corrective Services officers. He did not enter pleas nor apply for bail, which was formally refused by magistrate Ellen Skinner. Police allege Mr Smith approached a woman in the Maitland District Leagues Club car park as she was strapping her child in a pram on Sunday morning. He allegedly stole her handbag and attempted to drive off in her car before fleeing. He faces four charges including an attempted carjacking count, use or possess or attempt to threaten to use an offensive weapon and two dishonesty counts relating to stealing the handbag and trying to withdraw money using a stolen keycard. Mr Smith is then alleged to have attacked the girl later that day. He was arrested at Telarah railway station about 12.10am yesterday before being charged. He will face Newcastle Local Court on December 15. http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/no-bail-in-alleged-knifing-sexual-assault-and-robbery/1971850.aspx

BRIAN SPILLANE (NSW)|69 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 9 yrs jail - 5 yrs non parole/ will be eligible for parole in November 2015..full sentence to expire on November 29, 2019.|Brian Spillane/ Former Catholic priest - Convicted of 8 charges of indecent assault on a female younger than 16, and one count of indecently assaulting a female aged 16 years or more.. The charges relate to abuses during the 1970s and 1980s when Spillane was a priest working in both Sydney and country areas of New South Wales. "Priest 'a violent bully and coward'" (20-4-2012) The former priest Brian Spillane has been sentenced to nine years' imprisonment for a series of sexual assaults on young girls - attacks described as "serious, planned and callous" by Judge Michael Finnane of the NSW District Court. "The offender used his position as a priest to gain access to the homes in which each of his victims lived," said the judge. "He was very trusted and the parents of each of the victims readily gave him access to their daughters because of that trust and the esteem in which he was held." The assaults began in the late 1970s when Spillane was on the staff of St Stanislaus College, a boys' boarding school in Bathurst. They continued when he became a parish priest in Sydney. He later returned to St Stanislaus as school chaplain. Spillane, 69, continues to deny all the charges that have been brought against him, not only those involving these young girls but some 100 charges he has yet to face relating to assaults on boys at the school. A heavy-set redhead, Spillane trained for the priesthood in the Vincentian Order and was sent to teach at St Stanislaus in the late 1960s. At his trial he described himself as a modern priest - joyful and enthusiastic, a hugger and kisser, a man at ease with families and their children. In the late 1970s, he ingratiated himself into a family with boys at the school and abused their sister, then aged 11. "This was the conduct of a violent bully and coward, done without regard to the effect it would have on the young girl," Judge Finnane said at sentencing. "It was sexual abuse carried out by a trusted priest, and was a major breach of trust." The Vincentians posted Spillane to Sydney in the late 1970s and for a time he was acting parish priest at St Anthony's Marsfield. There he befriended another devout Catholic family and, under the guise of hearing their daughters' bedtime prayers, abused both for more than a year. The judge called this: "Predatory and a major abuse of trust." One of those victims, known as Miss M, told the court of the devastating impact on her life of Spillane's abuse: of guilt, panic, mistrust, anger, depression, estrangement, drinking, drugs, loss of interest in study and, now, fearfulness for her daughter. She said: "It changed my fate and all that I wanted to be." In those years in Sydney, Spillane also assaulted and wrote love letters to a 16-year-old student at a western suburbs Catholic school. Judge Finnane called the assault "predatory and heartless" and the letters "maudlin, full of false piety and completely inappropriate". Spillane left the priesthood in 2004 and a son was born after his marriage that year. The first complaints about him were made to Bathurst police three years later. He was charged in 2008 and convicted by a District Court jury in 2010. Sentencing was delayed until yesterday by the defence solicitor Greg Walsh attempting to have his old friend Judge Finnane disqualify himself from this and any future proceedings involving Spillane. Mr Walsh claimed that after the swearing-in of a new District Court judge in March last year, Judge Finnane remarked over a cup of tea that paedophiles were "all guilty" and "should be put on an island and starved to death". Judge Finnane denied saying those words and declined to disqualify himself. The dispute reached the NSW Court of Appeal in November and the decision upholding the judge's right to sit was delivered a fortnight ago. The court found the words, if uttered, might have been incautious but couldn't be taken seriously and would not be regarded by a fair-minded bystander as prejudging the former priest's position. Lawyers estimate about $700,000 has been spent on the former priest's defence so far. But who is footing that bill is a mystery. A spokeswoman for the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Pell, says it is not the church. The Vincentian Order has refused to take the Herald's calls. At Spillane's sentencing, Judge Finnane spoke of receiving glowing testimonials to his good character. But, he added, "it has also to be said that he used his eminence in the community and his role as a priest to gain access to his victims and to carry out sexual offences on them." Miss M sobbed with relief when the judge sent her abuser to prison for nine years with a non-parole period of five. http://www.smh.com.au/national/priest-a-violent-bully-and-coward-20120419-1xa40.html "Priest jailed 5 years for sex assaults on young girls" (19-4-2012) A former Catholic priest has been jailed for at least five years for sexually abusing girls as young as eight. Brian Spillane, 69, was convicted today of eight charges of indecent assault on a female younger than 16 and one count of indecently assaulting a female aged 16 years or more. The charges relate to abuses during the 1970s and 1980s when Spillane was a priest working in both Sydney and country areas of New South Wales. In sentencing Spillane, Judge Michael Finnane called each assault "serious, planned and callous". He said Spillane's position as a priest and his "standing in the community" allowed him to gain access to the homes of his victims, many of whom came from devout Catholic families. Some of the offences occurred when Spillane was alone with his victims in their bedrooms for night-time prayers. One happened in a car after he'd said mass at a memorial service. "He was very trusted and the parents of each of the victims readily gave him access to their daughters because of that trust and the esteem in which he was held," Judge Finnane told Sydney's Downing Centre District Court. "The victims in this trial were all girls to whom he got access when he was conducting parish missions or ... when he was visiting a country town. "It was sexual abuse carried out by a trusted priest and was a major breach of trust." The judge said Spillane had shown no remorse and no contrition for his offending "which means that there can be little hope of rehabilitation". But he noted Spillane's age and said in all other respects the former priest had lived a "blameless life". Taking into account time already served, Spillane will be eligible for parole in November 2015. His sentence will expire on November 29, 2019. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/priest-jailed-5-years-for-sex-assaults-on-young-girls/story-fnat7dhc-1226333258489|/brian_spillane.jpg
DANIEL STANI-REGINALD (NSW)|21 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in May 2013, in the NSW Supreme Court, to 45 yrs jail - 30 yrs non parole..Eligible for release in 2041.|Daniel Stani-Reginald - Murderer/Rapist.. In March 2011 Stani-Reginald raped and then used a cord to strangle to death Tosha Thakkar, 24, a neighbour in the Croydon boarding house where he lived. "Teenager who raped, murdered and stuffed Indian student in a suitcase sentenced to 30 years in jail" (17-5-2013) As a teenager, Daniel Stani-Reginald spent hours on the internet researching notorious serial killers and rapists. Today a judge sentenced the now 21-year-old to spend at least 30 years behind bars in their company for the vicious rape and murder of a young Indian student. Stani-Reginald periodically yawned and appeared to smirk this morning as Justice Derek Price told the Supreme Court his "terrible" crimes stopped short of deserving a life sentence. In March 2011, when he was aged only 19, Stani-Reginald raped and then used a cord to strangle to death Tosha Thakkar, 24, a neighbour in the Croydon boarding house where he lived. He then stuffed her body in a large suitcase he had bought from Target a month earlier and caught a taxi to Meadowbank, where he threw the bag in a canal. Workmen discovered Ms Thakkars corpse two days later and Stani-Reginald was arrested for the murder. When police searched his laptop they found nearly 10,000 links to articles and websites he accessed over the past four months, including searches on Charles Manson and Australian teen killer Matthew Milat. One newspaper article he viewed on the day he purchased the bag featured details on the 2007 murder of Sydney toddler Dean Shillingsworth, whose body was hidden in a suitcase and tossed in a duck pond. The morning of Ms Thakkar's murder her killer had searched for "choke hold" and also viewed pornography. Prosecutors had asked for Stani-Reginald to be handed a life sentence, arguing he had clearly decided to ``school himself as a serial rapist and killer. Justice Price said the 21-year-old's strangulation of Ms Thakkar was "extraordinarily cruel" and he had shown no remorse, empathy or contrition for the pain he had inflicted. "The last moments of her life must have been horrifying - this was a terrible way for (her) to die," he said. But Justice Price said while Stani-Reginald's crimes were the worst imaginable of their types, he couldn't be sure he had planned to become a repeat murderer or sexual predator. He said there remained a high chance the killer would commit more crimes, but he didn't deserve to spend the rest of his young life in jail. "I am satisfied that there is a real risk that the offender will re-offend by committing serious offences of violence or sexual assault ... I do not make this finding lightly," he said. Stani-Reginald didn't react as he was sentenced to 45 years - with a minimum of 30 years - in prison. He will first be eligible for release in 2041. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/teenager-who-raped-murdered-and-stuffed-indian-student-in-a-suitcase-sentenced-to-30-years-in-jail/story-fni0cx4q-1226645128219 http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/05/17/11/26/man-gets-30-years-for-student-rape-murder http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/04/29/12/28/sydney-murderer-killed-our-life-parents http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/parents-anguish-murdered-daughter-was-their-sweet-little-fairy-20130429-2invw.html http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/420204/neighbour-admits-to-murdering-student/
JAMES NIGEL STEPHENS (James Stephens) (NSW - Sydney)|24 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in October 2013, in the New South Wales District Court, to 20 yrs jail - 14 yrs non parole.|James Nigel Stephens - Pleaded guilty to 3 counts of aggravated sexual assault and aggravated detention of a person for advantage. "Car boot rapist jailed for 14 years" (17-10-2008) A Sydney teenager who launched a "rampage of rape" on a topless waitress after hiding in her car boot has been jailed for at least 14 years. In setting a maximum term of 20 years for James Nigel Stephens, Judge Michael Finnane said "It must be the worst nightmare for any woman to have a man suddenly emerge in a motor vehicle". Stephens, then 18, was at a buck's party where the woman, 22, had worked in January last year. He secretly took her keys, opened the boot and later got into it. He pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated sexual assault and aggravated detention of a person for advantage over the incident at Waterloo, in inner-Sydney. "What he did was horrifying in its cruelty," the judge said in the New South Wales District Court. "It was planned and calculated. "He hid himself in the boot of her car and when she was alone, emerged suddenly, grabbed her from behind, threatening her with a plastic fork pressed to her neck, causing her to scream with fear." He forced the woman to pull over "then started a rampage of rape, in the course of which he anally raped her twice, vaginally three times, orally once and digitally twice". The judge said Stephens had good relationships with his family, particularly his sister, and there was nothing in his background to suggest he was a sex offender. "Some of the offences had a sadistic quality to them and he showed, during the time of committing these offences, an attitude of contempt for the complainant and utter indifference to her suffering," he said. "Nothing in his background explains any of this." The judge concluded Stephens had "intelligence, ambition, physical fitness" and had been well regarded as an employee and as a footballer with some potential. "I must emphasise that I have no acceptable evidence that he drank to excess or that he consumed anabolic steroids," the judge said. During sentencing submissions last month, Stephens' barrister had submitted the teenager had probably been under the influence of a "very, very nasty cocktail" of alcohol and steroids. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-10-17/car-boot-rapist-jailed-for-14-years/545572

During one of the home invasions a woman was raped. Invaders get 10 years jail WHILE two men responsible for a harrowing South Grafton home invasion will spend almost a decade behind bars, their accomplice still roams free. South Grafton man Travis Braam, 21 and Clarenza man Andrew Mark Stewart, 24, were sentenced for their part in a brutal Bent St home raid in November 2010. In November last year a Grafton Court heard how the two men pleaded guilty to two home invasions in nine days, one in which a woman was raped and a man had his finger dislocated. Both were sentenced at the Downing Centre District Court last week, with Judge Anthony Garling handing Braam 15 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of nine years and Stewart 15 years and six months, with a non-parole period of 10 years. The men won't be released until November 2019 and November 2020 respectively. Grafton Police's Det Sgt Grahame Burke welcomed the tough sentencing. "This result sends a clear message that these types of offences are considered extremely serious," Det Sgt Burke said. "Any individual involved in a 'run in', as these types of offences are sometimes referred to by the criminal element, should expect a lengthy jail term when arrested." Croydon man Ashley Jack Cullen, 20, was granted bail after pleading guilty to his involvement in the second of the two invasions. Grafton detectives confirmed a warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to appear for sentencing. Anyone who has seen Cullen is urged to contact Grafton Police on 6642 0222 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. http://www.dailyexaminer.com.au/story/2012/04/18/invaders-get-10-years-jail/
LESLIE JAMES STEWART (NSW - Windang)|64 yrs (2012)|Sentenced 23-2-2012, to 10 yrs jail/ 7 yrs 3 months non parole.|Sexually assaulted 8 children, including a 5 yr old girl. Stewart pleaded guilty in 2011 to sex offences, including 1 charge each of sexual intercourse with a person under 16, and aggravated indecent assault. News (24-2-2012)- "'Sexual predator' Leslie Stewart jailed"- A Windang man who molested eight children, including a five-year-old girl, was described as a "true sexual predator" yesterday as he was sentenced to an overall 10 years' jail for the horrific abuse. Leslie James Stewart, known as "Uncle Les" to many of his victims, was ordered to serve a minimum seven years and three months for the assaults, which spanned more than two decades. Sentencing the 64-year-old to jail, Judge Paul Conlon said Stewart was a true sexual predator in every sense of the word. "The mere recitation of the facts are sufficient to show the extreme seriousness of [his] conduct. "The offender engaged in a lengthy period of sexual offending against young, vulnerable children ... this was a gross breach of trust," he said. The offences, which took place in several Wollongong suburbs and in Orange and Mudgee, were committed between 1977 and 2002 and often occurred while Stewart babysat the children. Judge Conlon told Wollongong District Court most of the victims had been subjected to ongoing sexual abuse and several had experienced degrading acts. The court heard Stewart had been "unusually frank" in discussing his conduct, admitting to fantasising about young girls and taking advantage of staying with the victims or caring for them to molest them. The first victim, now 44, was repeatedly assaulted by Stewart between the ages of nine and 12, while her younger sister recalled Stewart driving her to Wollongong Crematorium and assaulting her. Another victim, now 39, was molested by Stewart at her home when he entered the bathroom while she was naked. Stewart sexually abused a fourth victim, now 44, while living with her family, regularly entering her bedroom and assaulting her while she was asleep. Stewart fed ice cream to another girl, who was aged five at the time, before assaulting her for about 10 minutes. He later exposed himself to a sixth victim while parked in the driveway of her Mudgee home. A male complainant was aged 12 when Stewart assaulted him outside a Warrawong club and the final victim was assaulted while living with Stewart in Orange. Judge Conlon referred to a psychiatric report, noting Stewart had shown little understanding of the impact of his actions and would benefit from a sex offender program while in custody. The court was told Stewart had expressed remorse and had some medical problems. Stewart pleaded guilty last year to a raft of sex offences, including one charge each of sexual intercourse with a person under 16 and aggravated indecent assault. http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/sexual-predator-leslie-stewart-jailed/2466132.aspx

GRAHAM ERNEST TAYLOR (NSW- Gunnedah)|53 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in 1996, to 3 yrs jail.|Serial paedophile/ Graham Taylor-Formerly of Britain. Convicted of 8 child sex offences. Repeatedly abused 4 young boys over a 14 yr period. New (21-5-2012)- "Boy-sex man can become citizen"- A CONFESSED serial pedophile from Britain, who repeatedly abused four young boys over a 14-year period, has been cleared for Australian citizenship after a tribunal ruled he was of "good character". The decision was made despite an intelligence report from Washington indicating his credit card, full name, address, phone number and email were used to purchase child pornography over the internet between December 2003 and March 2004. Graham Ernest Taylor's application for citizenship was opposed on character grounds, given his 1996 convictions for eight counts of sexually abusing children aged about 11. Taylor lives on a disability pension in Gunnedah, northern NSW. He appealed against the department's character assessment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, saying he had completed rehabilitation programs in jail and saw a psychiatrist for 18 months after his release in 1999. The tribunal heard the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US had alerted the Australian Federal Police that Taylor's personal details had been used to purchase child pornography over a four-month period. NSW police sought a warrant to search Taylor's home in 2005, but the magistrate declined their request and the investigation was dropped. In his reasons of February 2, AAT deputy president Robin Handley wrote: "Mr Taylor's reputation will probably be forever tainted by the moral opprobrium with which his misconduct is rightly viewed. However . . . I am satisfied that he has reformed and . . . should now be regarded as of good character." Immigration Minister Chris Bowen's office said that the minister was "disappointed" by the tribunal's decision and had "sought further advice on potential options". http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/boy-sex-man-can-become-citizen/story-e6frg6nf-1226361630852

Convicted of the murder and sexual assault of a 4 yr old girl (Lauren Hickson) at Emu Plains, Western Sydney, in 1989... Towner bashed Lauren over the head with a rock to stop her screaming as he was raping her then drowned her in the Nepean River. Child killer could be released in seven years- (19-10-2002)- One of NSW's most notorious killers could walk free from jail in seven years after a judge yesterday redetermined his life sentence. Neville Raymond Towner, 36, has served 13 years over the sexual assault and murder of four-year-old Lauren Hickson at Emu Plains, in western Sydney, on May 17, 1989. Justice Greg James yesterday redetermined his life sentence, setting a minimum 20-year term, making Towner eligible for parole in 2009. Justice James told the NSW Supreme Court that Towner should have the prospect of release. "Although this crime was horrible, its seriousness, having regard to the views of the trial judges, was not such as to require [Towner] never be released," he said. A family friend and babysitter, Towner, then aged 23, bashed Lauren over the head with a rock to stop her screaming as he was raping her. He then drowned her in the Nepean River. Last Friday would have been Lauren's 18th birthday. A psychiatrist told the court Towner accepted responsibility for his crime and its enormity but had actively sought to forget it. The Crown had argued that his inability to recall the detail of Lauren's ordeal showed he did not fully acknowledge his guilt. Lauren's mother, Jurina Hickson, said child killers should "rot in jail". "I'm scared, I'm scared for my family. He's going to come after us ... we've heard that's why he's desperate to get out," Mrs Hickson said. Towner was jailed under a previous sentencing act in which the worst category of murder attracted a mandatory life sentence. Under the "truth in sentencing" legislation of 1989, some prisoners won the right to have their sentences redetermined. http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/18/1034561315976.html

ROBERT JASON TURNBULL (NSW - Hamilton South, Fowler Street)|38 yrs old (2011)|Sentence TBU. Pleaded guilty in Newcastle Local Court 17-8-2011, to two counts of indecent assault.|Paedophile- Repeat Offender. News (18-8-2011)- "Man guilty of Marketown sex attack on 7-year-old"- A SEXUAL predator who molested a seven-year-old girl in a Marketown Shopping Centre toilet block was suspected of carrying out a similar attack weeks earlier, court documents revealed. Police recognised Robert Jason Turnbull immediately when they viewed security camera footage from a nearby shop on February 2, a police statement said. One officer informed his colleagues that Turnbull was a suspect in a similar attack at the Newcastle West shopping centre on January 13, prompting detectives to arrest Turnbull at his Fowler Street, Hamilton South, home within minutes. Turnbull, 38, pleaded guilty in Newcastle Local Court yesterday to two counts of indecent assault and will face Newcastle District Court next week. He has a criminal record for sexual abuse and has been refused bail since his capture, court documents stated. The girl was at the shopping centre with her mother on February 2 when she ran to the toilet block on the Parry Street side of the building. She was in the women's toilets when she noticed Turnbull peering over the toilet door at her and looking at her through a gap between the door and the stall. Turnbull told the girl to let him in because he needed to fix something, but once inside he locked the door and told her to pull her skirt down. She didn't so Turnbull did before assaulting her twice. A witness in the stall beside them became suspicious when she heard Turnbull say, "Be quiet or I'll kill you" and the girl say "I don't like what you're doing to me". The witness said, "What's going on," and then came out of her stall to see the victim standing there upset. She took the girl to her mother and they went to centre management, where police were called. Turnbull denied being at the shopping centre, but police found a matching palm print on one of the toilet doors. http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/man-guilty-of-marketown-sex-attack-on-7yearold/2262153.aspx News (24-2-2011) - Robert Jason Turnbull,of Fowler Street, Hamilton South, appeared in court charged with aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, attempted sexual intercourse with a child, and assault with intent to have sexual intercourse with child. http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/man-refused-bail-over-alleged-indecent-assault/2085964.aspx

Found guilty in the NSW District Court,of 120 sex offences, including 22 of having sexual intercourse with a child under 10. 'Vile' Whitby jailed for at least 26 years for child sex crimes (8-10-2010) http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/vile-whitby-jailed-for-at-least-26-years-for-child-sex-crimes-20101008-16art.html DJ found guilty of 120 sex offences (1-7-2010) David Shane Whitby was naked as he turned directly to the camera and in a child-like voice boasted: "I love to molest children." His confessional video was part of the Sydney disc jockey's horrific collection, which depicted him sexually abusing eight children, including a screaming baby, over a 10-year period. In some videos, Whitby is wearing items including a pink fairy outfit, a black mask, a black body suit, black high heels or a suspender belt and stockings, as are some victims. Despite the 56-year-old's contention that a lookalike acquaintance was the culprit, Judge Peter Berman has concluded Whitby is the man depicted in the videos. "I am absolutely certain, well beyond any reasonable doubt, that the accused has been correctly identified as being the adult male in those videos," he said on Thursday. The NSW District Court judge, who heard the trial without a jury, found Whitby guilty of 120 sex offences, including 22 of having sexual intercourse with a child under 10. "Some of the children are only seen being abused on one occasion," the judge said. "Others are seen being abused on multiple occasions over many years." Crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC said if every single offence portrayed on the DVDs had been charged there would be "many thousands" of counts on the indictment. The offences came to light when one victim reported her prolonged abuse after fearing Whitby would molest her baby sister. She became concerned when she saw him videoing her sister's first birthday party. "The memory of that video camera, just the thought of what happened, it brought back memories," she said. The judge, who spent more than one day viewing extracts from the DVDs, said they were "very difficult" to watch but he had to put his emotions to one side. Whitby, who wears his long grey hair in a ponytail, gave evidence claiming to have been "pretty traumatised" at seeing the DVDs in court. Although six people who knew him for many years identified him as being the man, Whitby said the culprit was Dave Haines, a man who resembled him. "He had access to just about everything in my life at one stage, friends, family, jobs," he said. He agreed that the DVDs depicted three locations where Whitby had lived and the victims were children with whom he had come into contact. Further, up to 70 items seen in the DVDs, such as masks, wigs and underwear, were similar to items found in his room and suitcase. The judge noted that "despite apparently being involved in about every aspect" of his life for 15 years, Whitby was unable to give an address, workplace or phone number for Dave Haines. The only people whom he could name who had met Dave Haines were three people, now dead, and Whitby's mother, who is too sick to give evidence. Other than the identification evidence, the judge stressed there were "many pieces of evidence which individually would be enough to demonstrate the accused's guilt". Sentencing submissions will take place on September 24. http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-national/dj-found-guilty-of-120-sex-offences-20100701-zp4m.html|/images/david_whitby.jpg

Leon Michael Wicks, 50, has been committed for sentence in Queanbeyan District Court on May 28. He remains in custody. Police charged Wicks after they raided his Yass home on December 16 last year. They seized an internet-ready laptop, which is prohibited for people on the Child Protection Register, a camera SD card, two computer towers and USB thumb-drives for examination. The hardware contained images of young boys in sexually explicit activities. Police further charged Wicks with obscene exposure in a public place, behaving in an offensive manner in a public place, and failing to comply with reporting obligations as part of the sex offenders register. He has pleaded not guilty to these charges. They will proceed at a later date before Goulburn Court.

In handing down the sentence, the judge described Neal Richard Winter 's criminality as "enormous". Winter was found guilty of sexually abusing three boys over a decade from 1992. One victim was aged 12 when the abuse began, while the other two were 14. In the New South Wales District Court, judge Peter Berman said Winter had shown no remorse whatsoever for his crimes and had made it clear he did not care about the harm he had caused his victims. He said Winter had ingratiated himself with the boy's families through the local church. He sentenced Winter to a maximum 16 years in jail, with a non-parole period of 12 years.

MARK TERRENCE WOODS (NSW)|50 yrs old (2012)|Released from jail in May, 2011 after serving just over 24 years.. Woods must abide by 26 conditions, including wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet, abstaining from alcohol and not visiting Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Maitland or Port Stephens local government areas.|Mark Terrence Woods-Rapist.."his victim a 56 yr old woman, received multiple stab wounds to her throat, chin and chest, had three toes broken, suffered facial bruising and was burnt on her back, buttock and left arm, requiring skin grafts"-below - News (22-6-2011)- "'Evil' man who raped Cooks Hill woman set free" A sadistic rapist who was given two life terms for repeatedly stabbing and assaulting a woman before trying to burn her alive has walked free from jail after it was determined he could not receive any more treatment for his "evil" urges in prison. Although his sexually depraved behaviour continued behind bars, including episodes where female prison guards and psychiatric nurses were transferred to keep them away from him, Mark Terrence Woods will only have to abide by some parole conditions to remain free. In a crime which shook the Hunter, the then 24-year-old broke into a Cooks Hill home on a summer morning in 1986 and sexually assaulted a 56-year-old woman before subjecting her to a horrific 3.5-hour ordeal. The woman received multiple stab wounds to her throat, chin and chest, had three toes broken, suffered facial bruising and was burnt on her back, buttock and left arm, requiring skin grafts. Woods took the woman to a track off Scenic Drive, Merewether Heights, where he raped her a second time before he shoved her into the car boot and set fire to the fuel tank. He attacked her twice as she attempted to escape, throwing her into the flames and repeatedly stomping on her head before stabbing her several times and leaving her, bleeding profusely, on the ground. Woods has also admitted to trying to drown his mother when he was 16, and to another sex attack in 1983. The Cooks Hill woman, now aged 80, is still living in fear. Authorities have spoken to her about her concerns that Woods could return. It has been 10 years since he first went for parole. They kept him in there for 10 years so it goes to show they know something is very wrong with him, the victim told the Newcastle Herald yesterday. In sentencing Woods to two terms of life imprisonment, Justice Marcus Yeldham remarked: No words of mine can adequately describe the enormity of what you did. ... In almost 13 years upon this bench I have seen many wicked crimes in our community. I doubt whether any have been more evil than that which you did to this middle-aged, innocent and helpless lady. Justice Yeldham also made special reference to Woodss answer in his record of interview when he was asked why he committed the crime. I needed a sheila. It just got out of hand, Woods told police. Woodss sentence was redetermined in 2005 to a minimum 20 years with a maximum of life. He was released last month after serving just over 24 years. Woods will need to abide by 26 conditions, including wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet, abstaining from alcohol and not visiting Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Maitland or Port Stephens local government areas. But the reasons for granting his parole have most incensed victims groups. Woods successfully completed two sexual offenders courses in jail and in a psychological risk assessment last September it was noted: It is generally considered that Mr Woods has done all that he can re treatment in custody. A probation and parole report, dated September 30 last year, also noted his successful response to day and weekend leave opportunities. In redetermining his sentence in 2005, however, Justice Budden noted expert evidence uniformly indicates that [Woods] ... is at risk or even at high risk of reoffending. Victims of Crime Assistance League executive director Robyn Cotterell-Jones said Woodss victim had become resigned to the fact that Woods would be released. Justice for victims can be an elusive thing with little certainty, Ms Cotterell-Jones said. Trusting a sentence of never to be released or two life sentences should never be taken as the end of the matter, that a victim is now forever safe, because laws are always being changed and never doesnt mean never. The fact that a probation and parole report noted there were no further treatment options available to Woods in custody was of little comfort to victims. It is inevitable that when a person who has committed a gruesome crime that changed everything about you and your life is to be released, and one of the reasons given is hes had all the treatment we can give him, is to hope and pray that no other woman crosses his path if the whim takes him to rape and attempt to murder, Ms Cotterell-Jones said. Its a bad way to find out that analysis was wrong. http://www.theherald.com.au/story/472173/evil-man-who-raped-cooks-hill-woman-set-free/ News (24-6-2011)- In the past week reports of the release of two rapists have raised in my mind the issue of community rights versus offender rights, and I am not alone. The first case is of Mark Terrence Woods, who in 1986 at age 24 broke into the Newcastle home of a 56-year-old woman and raped, stabbed and burnt her before taking her to nearby bush. There he raped her again, put her into a car boot and set the car alight. Twice as she tried to escape he pushed her back into the flames, and finally her stomped repeatedly on her head, stabbed her again and left her bleeding on the ground. Amazingly she survived, and she lives still in Newcastle, and she is afraid. At times in his 24 years in jail Woods propensity for depraved behaviour caused prison authorities to transfer female prison guards and psychiatric nurses for their safety. And in 2005 a judge redetermining Woods life sentences to a minimum of 20 years and a maximum of life noted that all the expert evidence agreed that Woods was at risk or very high risk of reoffending. Woods has been released from jail into supervision because, it seems, it has been deemed that he could be offered no more treatment for his depravities in jail. http://www.theherald.com.au/story/471949/the-notional-victim/ http://www.nbnnews.com.au/index.php/2011/06/23/concern-over-rapists-release/

"Man jailed over rape of aunt" (11-3-2011) A full drunk Borroloola man who raped his aunt has been sentenced to prison for five and a half years. Alfred Anderson, 28, went into the womans bedroom while she was asleep in the early hours of 7 November 2009 and sexually assaulted her. The Supreme Court in Darwin heard that following the rape, the woman felt no good. I feel like killing myself, she said in her victim impact statement. Mr Anderson told a court hearing in February that he had had a long-standing sexual relationship with the victim but later admitted this was not true. Justice Barr said although Anderson was not gratuitously violent towards his victim, he had forced himself upon her using his superior strength and body position and took advantage of the fact the woman was initially asleep and unable to protect herself. An eight month balance of sentence - arising from an incident where he inadvertently struck a three-year-old in the face with a knife - was included in the sentence. A non-parole period of three years, seven months applies. http://tennantcreek.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/man-jailed-over-rape-of-aunt/2100705.aspx

Calixto Arroyo was jailed for six years after a jury found him guilty of raping a staff member at the Ayers Rock Resort, near Uluru, in December 2008. The Court of Criminal Appeal today dismissed an appeal against his conviction but substituted the jury's verdict with one of attempted sexual intercourse without consent. Justice Dean Mildren said the appeal panel needed to consider the psychological impact on the victim and the fact that she was asleep at the time of the attack. Arroyo's sentence was reduced to four years and he will be eligible for parole next June. The crown prosecutor told the court Arroyo was on a criminal justice stay visa and would be required to leave the country upon his release. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-06-24/jail-sentence-reduced-in-resort-rape-case/880210 http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-05-22/resort-rape-peruvian-man-jailed/1691706

News (28-6-2007)- "Jailed paedophile ring 'abusing young prisoners'"- A group of convicted Aboriginal paedophiles are abusing young indigenous prisoners in an Alice Springs jail, according to prison sources. Insiders have gone public with the information amid fears the Federal Government's crackdown on child sex abuse in the Northern Territory could flood prisons with more dangerous sex offenders. There are reportedly 44 paedophiles at the Alice Springs jail, who are accommodated with 350 other inmates. In one incident earlier this year, Harrison Green, 47, and another man allegedly lured a 19-year-old facing burglary charges into a cell and forced him to have sex. Territory Police say Green, who is already serving an indefinite sentence for horrific sex crimes against children as young as eight, will be charged on summons for having sexual intercourse without consent inside the prison. "It's disgusting. A hard core group of convicted sex offenders has been preying on young vulnerable inmates for years," a prison source told the Sydney Morning Herald. The source added that inmates in their teens facing non-sexual offences were often put in dormitories with sex offenders. The president of the Northern Territory Prison Officers Association, Rick Drake, confirmed there was a serious problem with sex offenders mixing with other prisoners. Drake, who used to work at the Alice Springs prison, said the abuse has been happening there since at least 2000. Segregating sexual predators from other prisoners could be a solution, Drake said, but there were not enough segregated facilities in Alice Springs to make it possible. http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/275674/jailed-paedophile-ring-abusing-young-prisoners

News (31-3-2011)- A Melbourne man will reappear in court for sentencing on May 18 after pleading guilty to three offences following an incident with a police officer on Wednesday. Paul Incani, 43, appeared in Wangaratta Magistrates Court yesterday after being arrested following an incident in which a Wangaratta highway patrol officer was dragged by a car for a short distance. The officer had intercepted Incani near Porepunkah for a traffic offence about 2.30pm. It was discovered he had an outstanding warrant in the Northern Territory and the officer reached in to turn off the vehicles ignition. But Incani drove off with the officer suffering minor injuries. Police later arrested Incani on the Selwyn Creek Track in the Buckland Valley about 40 kilometres south of Porepunkah at 5.30pm. Incani pleaded guilty to charges of escaping from police custody, resisting arrest and recklessly causing injury. The case was heard by magistrate John Murphy through a video link to Shepparton. Incani was bailed to reappear for sentencing.  http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/57935/police-drag-racer-guilty/   No more jail for sex act teacher- (31-10-2008)  A TEACHER who indecently dealt with a Northern Territory student will not serve any more time behind bars after winning an appeal for a fully-suspended sentence.  http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/10/31/13015_ntnews.html   Sex attack teacher gets 3 months jail,but walks free on bail-(12-7-2008)  A FAMILY friend of a teenage student indecently assaulted by her teacher called out "not enough" as the man was jailed for three months yesterday. And 40 minutes later the 40-year-old teacher was bailed by Darwin's Chief Magistrate after he lodged an appeal against the sentence to be heard in the Supreme Court. Melbourne-based teacher Paul Incani, who pleaded guilty to indecently dealing with the teenage Darwin student, proceeded to "dry hump" the girl at a popular picnic spot, indecently touch her and make her lie semi-naked on his back. Magistrate Greg Cavanaghwho adjourned the matter overnight to consider the teacher's fatesaid he was "satisfied" he had breached his special relationship with his student, given the teacher had disguised the girl in sunglasses and a hat for a secret liaison at Lake Alexander last year and sent her intimate text messages. "This was a planned and sustained seduction by a mature adult of a young lady," Mr Cavanagh said. "It was not something that was on the spur of the moment ... (and) not something that was incidental to an innocent arrangement. "To suggest otherwise is fanciful." He said the man's crimes were serious as they were not "just a passing caress". And the teacher's "great affection" for his student had destroyed his teaching career, with his name to be placed on the national sex offenders register. "I've got no doubt that (he) knew he was doing the wrong thing but couldn't resist the temptation," he said. He said the teacher's actions had an "ongoing impact" on the girl, who yesterday publicly spoke of her despair and spiral into self-harm. Mr Cavanagh said the teacher's behaviour should be "denounced" as "outrageous". "He was entrusted with the tutoring by the young lady's parents at home. He's betrayed their trust and the community's trust," he said. He sentenced the teacher to 15 months jail, suspended after three months. The maximum penalty is eight years jail. As Incani was led out of court, a family friend said "have a nice time". But his lawyer Peter Elliott lodged an immediate appeal, and chief magistrate Jenny Blokland granted him bail on strict conditions to return to Melbourne with his father. Incani showed no emotion nor made any comment as he left court. He is expected to appear in the Supreme Court later this year. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/07/12/4651_ntnews.html Sex act teacher ruined my life http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/07/11/4637_ntnews.html|/images/paul_incani_2.jpg

Month in jail for child porn cache- (24-11-2011) A MAN will spend a month in jail for possessing child pornography found on memory cards he bought at an NT second-hand store. Brenton Robert Kenward, 29, was sentenced last week to nine months' prison to be suspended after one month. He pleaded guilty in the NT Supreme Court to three counts of possessing child abuse material - ranging up to the worst possible category - after his McMinns Lagoon bedroom was searched by police in July and September last year. Justice Judith Kelly said during sentencing that police found a laptop in his bedroom that had 1932 images in its deleted items folder on July 20, 2010. She said three of those images were category 5 - or sexual activity between adults and children with a "cruelty or torture" component. But she said most of the images were category 1 with no sexual activity. Justice Kelly said two memory cards - containing 1497 images and 61 videos - were found when police searched Kenward's bedroom for a second time in September 2010. She said the memory cards were found inside old phones that Kenward bought from Cash Converters. "You simply found the material on memory cards you acquired for another purpose," she said. She said Kenward had two prior convictions for indecent dealings with children under 16 years that would suggest he had "a sexual interest in children". Kenward was convicted and placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2011/11/24/274321_ntnews.html

News (24-12-2011)- "Child porn guilty plea"- A MAN charged with possessing child pornography would not have broken the law if he had sex with a 16-year-old girl but will spend five months in prison for looking at a picture of one, a court heard this week. David August Kruhse, 43, pleaded guilty in the NT Supreme Court to possessing 2262 child abuse images and 269 movies on his computer. But his lawyer, Peter Elliott, told Justice Stephen Southwood that Kruhse only had an interest in looking at "attractive" 16 or 17-year-old girls. "If he had actually engaged in sexual activity he wouldn't be committing a crime," he said. Crown prosecutor Lisa Brown said the relevant legislation defined a child as being under 18 years. She said 23 images and 31 movies were in the worst two categories which showed children engaged in sexual activity with adults. But Mr Elliott said his client simply downloaded a file off the internet and did not look at all of the images. "You don't choose ... It's not like a big display (of pictures) and you say I want this one and this one," he said. "He is a regular with the exception of this (incident) Territory bloke." Justice Southwood said during sentencing Kruhse yesterday that the material was "dumped" on his computer and he may not have known images of the worst category were in the file. But he said the rigger was an "intelligent" person who intentionally sought child porn on the internet for his own gratification, something that caused its production. "The community strongly disapproves of such behaviour," he said. He convicted and sentenced Kruhse to 10 months jail to be suspended after serving five months. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2011/12/24/279881_ntnews.html

Fortunately a roadhouse worker and the mother chased Poulson who dropped the child. Prior history includes- assault of a 3yr old girl. (Read newspaper article below). News (22-5-2009)- "Outback Abductor Preyed 'Like a Hawk'"- HOTEL landlord Lew *** will never forget a mother's panic-stricken screams for help as a man abducted her six-year-old daughter and fled into the night. "It was scary to watch because it was all so quick," he said. "The man swooped out of the shadows, scooped up the child and vanished into the darkness. "It was like a hawk sweeping down on a chicken. "Even if the mother had glanced away for a second she would have missed what happened. "It is so fortunate she noticed and was able to chase him." The mother was travelling from Alice Springs to Darwin with her three young children when she pulled in to refuel at the Wycliffe Well roadhouse, 130km south of Tennant Creek, about 8pm in July last year. Frederick Jabanunga Poulson from Ali Curung grabbed the girl and carried her under the Stuart Highway bridge and into the bush - but he tripped and dropped the girl as the mother chased him. Justice Trevor Olsson said in the Alice Springs Supreme Court that the offence abduction was ""brazen and calculated" and was "rendered all the more frightening by its suddenness at night time". He sentenced Poulson to five-and-a-half years jail, with a non-parole period of three years. He said Poulson's rehabilitation prospects were not good as he had not learnt from his past court appearances for stealing and violence, and assaulting a three-year-old girl. "That monster should never be released," Mr *** said after the sentence. "I have no doubt at all that he intended to commit a horrendous crime that night. I get chills every time I think about it." Mr *** was getting ready to close for the night when he heard the mother's screams. He joined the chase and reached the mother as she picked up her daughter who was badly hurt after being dropped face-first on a large rock. Police were called and although the man disappeared after the incident he later returned to warm himself by a drum in which rubbish was burning and was arrested. Mr *** believes Poulson planned the attack in revenge, having earlier been ordered out of the roadhouse for stealing. "He's twisted and callous. "He doesn't have friends because he's dangerous and remorseless. "I know I'm not the only one hoping he rots in hell because jail just isn't enough justice for what he's done."

WILLIAM GORDON TURNER (William Turner) (Northern Territory - Darwin)|52 yrs old (2008)|Sentenced to an indefinite period of imprisonment 2008.. Turner has a 30 year history of sexual crimes against women and girls, starting in the early 1970s.|William Gordon Turner - Rapist/ Paedophile/ Repeat Offender..Pleaded guilty to child sex crimes committed over a 4 year period involving a girl who was 11 years old on the date of the first offence..Turner has a 30 year history of sexual crimes against women and girls, starting in the early 1970s. "Predator in jail 'forever'" (19-5-2008) One of the Territory's worst child "sexual predators'' has been sentenced to an indefinite period of imprisonment. And a Darwin woman who sexually abused a girlincluding on a public park bench"in company'' with the man will spend at least five years behind bars. William Gordon Turner had a 30-year history of sex crime when he subjected an 11-year-old girl to four years of sexual abuse. Chief Justice Brian Martin said last Thursday he could not impose a fixed period of 25 years jail, because there was a high risk Turner would still seek out and abuse the "young and vulnerable'' at 77-years-oldeven if he was "physically frail''. "The power to fix an indefinite sentence is an exceptional power and should be exercised only in those cases where it is demonstrably necessary to protect the community from physical harm,'' Chief Justice Martin said. Unable to read or write, Turner's history of sexual offending dates back to 1973. At 18, he and his 16-year-old brother were convicted of raping two young hitchhikers near Mataranka, leaving them on the side of the road. But in the aftermath of the damage of Cyclone Tracy, he was released in January 1974 due to an "administrative error'' after serving just months of a six-year sentence. In January 1975, the Australian Governor-General reduced his sentence to two years. A year later he committed incest in Mt Isa, and was given 18-months jail. He went to Mataranka upon release in 1977, and after a short stint in jail for assault, he again raped a girl he abducted from the Berrimah Hotel. After his release in 1984, he bashed a 28-year-old woman and had unlawful sexual intercourse with her 11-year-old daughter. He was sentenced to 14 years in 1992, with a non-parole period of eight years, with the judge suppressing his name. Turner began to "pave the way'' to have sex with the 11-year-old Darwin girl, which saw him back in the Supreme Court this year, soon after he met her in February 2002. He bought her expensive presents, before starting to have sex with her in October 2006. He also forced her to watch porn and, when she turned 15, use dildos. Chief Justice Martin said Turner dominated the girl with threats to kill her and her family. "He threatened the child with harm to her and her family.'' In 2006, he introduced Patricia Anne Rayment to the girl. Rayment was 18 years older than the girl when she started sexually abusing her in company with Turner. Chief Justice Martin said Rayment was sexually abused as a child and often referred to Turner as 'Dad'. Turner is now the only prisoner currently serving an indefinite sentence. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/05/19/4154_ntnews.html http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-05-15/serial-rapist-gets-indefinite-sentence/2437744 http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/to-hell-and-back-for-child-sex-slave/story-e6frg6po-1111116451935

News (31-3-2012)- "From big sticks to big house"- A TERRITORY football league best and fairest player has been jailed for at least nine years for bashing two men and raping a woman at knifepoint. Under-18 Abala medallist Dermott Woods, 18, was sentenced in the NT Supreme Court to 12 years in prison with a non-parole period of nine years. He pleaded guilty to a string of violent offences - including assault and rape - between July 10 and August 8 last year. The court heard Woods woke a 31-year-old sleeping woman at a Fannie Bay unit and held a knife to her neck while he raped her on August 5. Justice Dean Mildren said the woman had since relapsed into chronic alcohol abuse. "This is very serious offending," he said. Woods also robbed two men on two separate occasions by ambushing them and repeatedly punching them on July 10 and 17. Justice Mildren said Woods had a "sheer joy of terrorising people" when he was drunk. Woods has played for St Marys Football Club senior side and was the leading goal kicker for the Saints in the Under-18 Grand Final last season. He also represented the NT at the 2011 NAB AFL Under-18 Championships. Justice Dean Mildren said Woods had hoped to be a professional football player. But he said the teenager caved to family pressures to drink - which would see him commit "senseless acts" of violence. Justice Mildren said Woods had spent two of the past six years in detention and was an alcoholic at the age of 15. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2012/03/31/296661_ntnews.html|/images/dermott_woods_2.jpg

GARY ANTHONY O'BRIEN (QLD- Townsville)|yrs old (2012)|Released from jail on parole in October/ 2008.. July 2011- in Townsville Magistrates Court was fined $300 and conviction recorded after pleaded guilty to failing to comply with reporting conditions,as was required under child protection legislation.|Gary Anthony O'Brien - Child sex offender. News (26-7-2011)- "Sex offender fined for failing to tell of bab" A child sex offender who failed to tell police he was living with a newborn baby in his home was fined in Townsville Magistrates Court yesterday. Gary Anthony O'Brien yesterday pleaded guilty to failing to comply with reporting in December last year, as was required under child protection legislation. Police prosecutor Helen Armitage told the court O'Brien was living in Kirwan with his brother and his brother's partner, who was pregnant. Under child protection laws, O'Brien was required to alert authorities to any changes involving children living in his home, which he failed to do when his nephew was born. Ms Armitage said when approached by police, O'Brien told them he had alerted his parole officer but did not tell Child Protection and Investigation Unit officers, as required. O'Brien told police he did not think he had to tell officers because he had already told his parole officer. He also told police he only thought the rule only applied to his own children, but later admitted to police he did not report when he should have. Defence lawyer Peter Saggers said his client was released from prison on parole in October in 2008 and moved to Kirwan in May 2009. He said O'Brien's brother and partner then moved into his house in May last year. "She was pregnant and there were spot checks throughout the time as there is with corrective services," he said. "It was obvious she was pregnant. "She was heavily pregnant by the time they saw her last time. "He thought he discharged his responsibility earlier because he'd told his parole officer." Mr Saggers said O'Brien mentioned it again to his parole officer after the baby was born, but did not mention it to police during an annual review later because he did not think he had to. The lawyer said his client did not intentionally break the parole conditions and requested he be released absolutely without punishment.

Police found the piece of wood, which also had hairs on it, on the edge of the camping area at Red Cliff, on the North Coast, where the 16-year-old's remains were discovered scattered in sand dunes in October 1997. The teen, described as shy by her parents, Peter and Robyn Stace, had vanished six weeks before while hitch-hiking home from her part-time job at Bi-Lo in Yamba. Three men - the Staces' former neighbour Gregory Davis, and convicted sex-offenders Anthony Apps and John O'Leary - have been identified as persons of interest to the inquest, however they will not be called to give evidence.

MATTHEW DAVID O'MEARA (Matthew O'Meara) ( WA - Perth/ formerly of Melbourne)|42 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in March 2013, in the Perth District Court, to 15 months jail - 7.5 months non parole.|Matthew David O'Meara - Four counts of possessing child pornography.. O'Meara was the chaplain of the elite Anglican girl's college, "Mount Lawley's Perth College", after relocating from Melbourne in January 2010. "Former Perth College chaplain Matthew David O'Meara jailed for 15 months" (21-3-2013) A former Perth College chaplain has been sentenced to 15 months imprisonment after being found guilty of possessing child pornography. A District Court jury found Matthew David OMeara guilty on Monday, following his three week trial over four counts of possessing child pornography after USBs were found containing photos and videos of young girls on them at Perth College in August 2010. In sentencing, Judge Ronald Birmingham said O'Meara's offending "struck at the very heart of the trust" imposed on him by Perth College when they employed him as head chaplain at the all-girls school. "They were entitled to expect more from you," he said. Almost 450 images were found in O'Meara's possession on the two thumb drives and deleted from his home computer, including images and movies of young girls performing sexual acts. Judge Birmingham said the evidence left no doubt O'Meara "had a tendency or a sexual interest in young girls." He said O'Meara had hid behind a mask to friends and family and insistence that others were responsible for the images on the thumb drives showed he had "no remorse." "That you fall from such a height is largely the result of a self-inflicted wound," he said. Despite the guilty verdict, O'Meara maintains his innocence and outside court his lawyers said he would be considering an appeal against the conviction. Defence counsel Laurie Levy told Judge Birmingham during his submissions that in the two years and seven months since his client was charged, O'Meara had become "professionally and financially ruined." He also said O'Meara's job prospects were non-existent because for more than 14 years he had worked as a teacher and a chaplain. Th Anglican Church has revoked his pastoral licence. This evening his wife Karina, parents and sister expressed their ongoing support for him. "We all believe that he has suffered a terrible injustice, a brutal injustice and we have to do what we can to regroup," Mrs O'Meara told reporters outside court. O'Meara was sentenced to six months imprisonment for counts one and four and nine months for counts two and three. However Judge Birmingham said count two was to be the head sentence, with counts one and three to be served concurrently and count four to be served accumulative, totalling 15 months. O'Meara will be eligible for parole after seven and a half months. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/former-perth-college-chaplain-matthew-david-omeara-found-guilty-of-child-porn-possession/story-e6frfkp9-1226602868355 http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/former-perth-college-chaplain-matthew-david-omeara-found-guilty-of-child-porn-possession/story-e6frg13u-1226600115691 http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/reverend-feared-retribution-before-child-porn-discovery-20121008-279ib.html|/images/matthew_david_o'meara.jpg

News (20-8-2010)- "Long jail term for abuser"- Former Esperance resident Mark Thomas OSullivan has been sentenced at the Perth District Court to eight and a half years in jail in relation to 26 child abuse offences. Mr OSullivan, 46, was jailed after a five-day trial in Perth last week. Judge Stavrianou said the offending was repeated over nine years, commencing when the girl was eight years of age. You have shown no remorse for your offending and continue to deny the commission of the offences, His Honour said. The complainant was exposed to a wide variety of adult sexual behaviour. As Ive said, the need for general and specific deterrence in this type of offending is significant. As Ive said also, you are not penalised in this sentencing process by the fact that youve pleaded not guilty to the charges. Esperance Police Detective Sergeant Doug Backhouse, who was in charge of the investigation, said that sexual offences against children would have to be the most abhorrent crime imaginable. I just cannot get my head around the fact that people can commit such despicable acts on innocent and vulnerable children for their own sexual gratification, and in the process destroy the young persons childhood and often affect them for the rest of their lives, he said. This office has been responsible for the conviction of a number of child sex offenders over the last several years and they all received lengthy jaill terms, justifiably so, he said.

Pleaded guilty to 8 charges including rape, rape in aggravated circumstances, and indecent assault. News (3-3-2012)- "DNA breaks rape case after 22 years"- A man who raped a nine-year-old girl and her stepmother more than 20 years ago has been jailed after a DNA breakthrough. Mark Ostler, 43, was 22 and abusing drugs and alcohol when he broke into the home of a sleeping family in October 1990 armed with a knife, the County Court heard. When arrested in April he confessed but claimed to have had little recollection of the attacks. Judge Carolyn Douglas, sentencing him to 13 years with a minimum of eight, said it was a difficult and unusual case because Ostler had otherwise led a good and law-abiding life. He had committed no crimes before or since the rapes. "There is no issue in this case that you have totally rehabilitated," Judge Douglas said. "There is no dispute that you genuinely do not have a good memory of this incident." Ostler did not know the occupants of the house and an extensive police investigation at the time failed to identify an offender. "In 1985, you provided your fingerprints as that was a requirement of obtaining a firearms licence," the judge said. "In early 2009, the investigation in relation to these matters was reviewed by the sexual crimes squad. "The fingerprints found at the scene . . . were your fingerprints. Subsequently, DNA samples were taken." Judge Douglas said the attacks continued to have an impact on Ostler's victims. "It is clear that you put these people through a terrifying ordeal," she said. "People are entitled to feel safe in our society in their home. The intrusion into the family home and the offences you committed are particularly serious given the young age of the complainant, the fact that you raped and indecently assaulted (the woman) in the presence of her partner." http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/dna-breaks-rape-case-after-22-years/story-fn7x8me2-1226287708783 http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/pillowcase-rapist-jailed-22-years-on-20120302-1u7dt.html

Those charges stemmed from an attack on a 17-year-old girl at a public toilet in Belmont on June 22, 2013.

GORAN PAJIC ()|36 yrs old (2012)|Will not be eligible for release for almost 5 yrs from May 2011.|Goran Pajic/ Repeat Offender - 2011/ pleaded guilty to a charge of detaining a woman by force with the intention of taking part in an act of sexual penetration.. Prior-jailed in 2005 for a maximum of 7 yrs for offences against a woman he grabbed and raped twice in bushes. News (3-5-2011)- "Rapist to spend five years behind bars" A man who tried to drag a woman into a car from a suburban street in broad daylight a month after being paroled for rape was today jailed by a Melbourne judge. The County Court heard last month that Goran Pajic, 35, was jailed in 2005 for a maximum of seven years for offences against a woman he grabbed and raped twice in bushes in a public area. With today's sentence, Pajic will be registered as a sexual offender for life and will not be eligible for release for almost five years. This is because by law, he must serve the more than three-years of his breached parole term - which he began on his arrest last year - on top of the two-and-a-half-year minium sentence judge Mark Gamble ordered this morning. Judge Gamble said that because Pajic was sentenced as a serious sexual offender, it was necessary for the protection of the community being the paramount sentencing consideration. After being paroled on that sentence, he stopped his car on March 15 last year opposite a woman, 48, walking in Lalor, and called out something that sounded like did she want a lift. Prosecutor Neill Hutton said she kept walking and felt increasingly uncomfortable as Pajic pulled over twice more before he walked into a house and then quickly reappeared and stood directly in front of her. Mr Hutton said he told her he wanted to talk and had something to tell her before she told him: "Please leave me alone. "I'm an older person, I'm married. I have kids. I need to go." Pajic remained in front her, blocked her path, repeating he wanted to talk to her and leaning right into her face before grabbing her arm and pulling her across the road to his car. Mr Hutton said the woman screamed for help until Pajic let go and drove away but the woman memorised his registration and dialled 000 before he was arrested that night. Pajic, formerly of Lalor, pleaded guilty to a charge of detaining the woman by force with the intention of taking part in an act of sexual penetration. Judge Mark Gamble said at the time that Pajic's conduct "struck fear into the mind" of the victim and "the community as a whole". Judge Gamble regarded being grabbed and dragged into his car to satisfy Pajic's "sexual desires was just a terrifying incident". His barrister had told the court that Pajic, who has an IQ of 55, had been found borderline-to-low range in every aspect of a clinical neuropsychologist's testing. The medical expert found it was likely that low reasoning and logic was impacting on his judgment at the time of offending. The barrister, Carolene Gwynn, said Pajic underwent a "miserable upbringing" at the hands of his violent but now-apologetic stepfather. Ms Gwynn said Pajic was bullied at school and repeatedly assaulted in prison where he underwent programs, including one for sex offenders, but had not started any on parole. She said he found the transition to parole difficult and had attended appointments, but the day of the offence was the first he had been alone since his release. Ms Gwynn said he had acted spontaneously and opportunistically with the woman and had not disguised himself or used an unidentifiable car. Judge Gamble today told Pajic, who has a long history of depression and trauma with low intellect, that he was a vulnerable prisoner and would serve his sentence in protective custody. Judge Gamble said Pajic had demonstrated some capacity for remorse but his prospects for rehabilitation were fairly limited. http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/rapist-to-spend-five-years-behind-bars-20110503-1e5to.html#ixzz1LfKygWCp

ATHANASIOS PAPAZOGLOU (VIC - Melbourne)|In his 60's|Sentenced May 2013, in the VIC County Court, to 9.5 yrs jail.|Athanasios Papazoglou - Convicted Paedophile..Found guilty in the VIC County Court, of child sex offences, against 2 girls between 1982-86. "Brave Abuse Survivor Polla encouraged other sexual abuse victims to report their attackers" "It has taken me 15 years to be able to tell my story in order to end the silence for myself and hopefully encourage other victims and survivors of sexual assault to speak out."speaks out about justice system. Papazoglou had repeatedly abused her from the age of five, between 1982 and 1986. As she stood on the steps of the County Court in Melbourne with her two daughters, she said she had been victimised through the lengthy legal proceedings. Polla described the proceedings as invasive. She said she was forced to reveal her medical records in the initial trial, which she told the judge was "morally wrong", but she was prepared to do whatever it took ensure justice. "I believe there should be a blanket approach to prohibiting access to health professionals' files as the defence should not be able to use this private confidential information against victims [and] survivors in court," she said. "Having my private life exposed, judged and criticised has left me feeling more like the criminal instead of the victim. "Why is it, that I, the victim, am officially the longest person ever to be sitting in the witness box in the County Court? Shouldn't that be the criminal? "The justice system should be protecting the rights of victim/survivors instead of forcing them to fight their battle." -below. "Sex offender jailed, but heavy toll for victim" (3-5-2013) For more than a decade, Polla kept a monstrous secret. She was sexually abused by a trusted family friend. It wasn't until she had children of her own - and her abuser, Athanasios Papazoglou, reappeared in her life - that she broke her silence. "It was my secret. I chose not to tell anyone; not my parents, not a soul," said Polla, who did not want her last name published. "Then I suddenly have two daughters and he makes his way back into my parents' life. "He has the nerve after so many years to basically say to my face... how much my kids reminded him of me when I was a kid," she said. "What would a person do to protect their kids, and also to protect the community, knowing that this person was a paedophile?" On Friday, Papazoglou was sentenced to nine years and six months' jail after he was found guilty following a retrial in the County Court. The charges relate to offences committed against Polla and another woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, who was a girl at the time of the abuse. The conviction gave Polla, who first made a statement to police 15 years ago, some closure, but not without a heavy emotional cost. In 1998, when Polla decided to finally seek justice, she was 23 years old. Her two children had not started primary school. Papazoglou had repeatedly abused her from the age of five, between 1982 and 1986. As she stood on the steps of the County Court in Melbourne with her two daughters, she said she had been victimised through the lengthy legal proceedings. Polla described the proceedings as invasive. She said she was forced to reveal her medical records in the initial trial, which she told the judge was "morally wrong", but she was prepared to do whatever it took ensure justice.

"Why is it, that I, the victim, am officially the longest person ever to be sitting in the witness box in the County Court? Shouldn't that be the criminal? "The justice system should be protecting the rights of victim/survivors instead of forcing them to fight their battle." In sentencing, Judge Meryl Sexton said that she accepted that Polla felt the justice system had let her down, particularly after the release of her medical records. Judge Sexton said she could not apologise for the law which allowed the release of the records, but acknowledged Polla now had a distrust of confiding in doctors and counsellors. "I emphasise that not all the records were released," Judge Sexton said, adding that Polla was a "strong woman who had come through two trials. "There is nothing I can say to ease your pain." Judge Sexton said Papazoglou, who was 34 to 38 years old at the time of offending, breached Polla and her family's trust and was "well aware" she was a "vulnerable little girl. Polla encouraged other sexual abuse victims to report their attackers: "It has taken me 15 years to be able to tell my story in order to end the silence for myself and hopefully encourage other victims and survivors of sexual assault to speak out." http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1476158/sex-offender-jailed-but-heavy-toll-for-victim/?cs=12
DAMIEN CHRISTOPHER PARK (Damien Park) (QLD- Mackay)|33 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced Feb 2013, in the District Court in Mackay, to 3 months jail.|Damien Christopher Park- Pleaded guilty to attempting to procure a child under 16 for a sex act, and distributing and possessing child exploitation material.

JUNG HU PARK ( NSW/ Korean national)|23 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Jung Hu Park/ Korean student-broke into a woman's room armed with a knife and rope, and raped her. Pleaded guilty to 2 charges of inflicting actual bodily harm,while having sexual intercourse without consent. News (26-2-2011)- "Rapist was depressed: psychiatrist" A Korean student's depression contributed to his sickening rape of a Figtree woman but not to the extent that he was unaware of what he was doing, a court has heard. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Stephen Allnutt yesterday told Wollongong District Court that Korean national Jung Hu Park, 22, was strongly driven by emotion when he broke into the woman's room on February 27 last year, armed with a knife and rope. Threatening to kill her if she screamed, Park tied the woman's hands to her neck before sexually assaulting and raping her. He also taunted her through the prolonged attack by reading a pre-prepared list of reasons why he wanted to kill her, but said he would give her tips on how to survive because he loved her. Park videotaped the ordeal, threatening to post it online and send it to her family and friends if she spoke out about the attack. He pleaded guilty to two charges of inflicting actual bodily harm on the woman while having sexual intercourse without consent. During a sentencing hearing yesterday, Dr Allnutt said there was some connection between Park's depression and the offence, and while his illness did not amount to psychosis, it did affect his judgment. Defence barrister James Trevallion described his client as a particularly young and naive man who was culturally isolated. "He has no access to other Korean people in custody, no family or friends close by ..." Mr Trevallion said. When questioned in the witness box, Park said he understood what he did was wrong and that he had hurt the woman. Director of Public Prosecutions lawyer Kristy Spiers said there were a number of aggravating features in the case, including the presence of a knife, the death threats, duration of the attack and the degree of planning involved. She also said the multiple sexual acts further degraded and humiliated the victim. Judge Paul Conlon reserved his judgment until April 15. http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/news/local/news/general/rapist-was-depressed-psychiatrist/2087597.aspx  Name: ANDREW JASON PARKER (TAS)|39 yrs old |Sentenced in 1993 to 2 yrs/5 mths jail. |Attacked a woman at gunpoint and sexually assaulted her.

"Man exploited girl to make porn" (24-1-2013) A child sex offender, who exploited a 12-year-old girl for the production of child pornography, has been jailed for seven years. Orazio Di Pasquale, 44, of Hamlyn Heights, pleaded guilty in Geelong County Court yesterday to charges of producing child pornography, sexual penetration of a child under 16 and sexual penetration of a child under 12. He also pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for the purposes of child pornography, possessing child pornography and two counts of using a surveillance device to observe a child. Crown Prosecutor Michael Sharpley said that, on August 31, 2011, police arrived at Di Pasquale's Hamlyn Heights unit with a search warrant. Mr Sharpley said police seized items including a computer, DVDs and a computer hard drive containing 33 still and moving pictures of the naked young girl. The prosecutor said that in late 2010, Di Pasquale filmed himself having sex with the child and had video cameras set up to film the girl. "When the young victim brought a friend to visit, Di Pasquale also videoed her in the shower," Mr Sharpley said. "The accused later told police he placed his mobile phone in the clothes basket to film the girls taking a shower." James McQuillan, who was defending Di Pasquale, submitted his client's offending was not at the highest end of the scale. The court was told Di Pasquale grew up in an environment of family violence, had worked for only brief periods throughout his adult life, had a heart condition and possible diabetes. Handing down sentence, Judge Gerard Mullally described Di Pasquale's crimes as "depraved" and "a perverse sexual abuse of children". "You are, it seems, sexually attracted to children," Judge Mullally said. "The young victim still has difficulty sleeping at night, has flashbacks and hates people touching her even if it's just mucking around. "The child has also threatened self-harm, leaving her family feeling heartbroken and helpless." Judge Mullally said, that while he accepted Di Pasquale had immediately admitted his offences, they were serious crimes. Di Pasquale was sentenced to seven years' jail with a non-parole period of five years and was also placed on the sex offenders' register. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2013/01/24/357832_news.html

Pendleton, who was caught with more than 50,000 images and videos depicting serious child pornography and bestiality, pleaded guilty in the WA District Court to numerous charges of child sexual abuse and downloading child pornography. They included 20 counts of indecent dealing, 22 counts of indecently recording the abuse, four counts of possessing child pornography, two counts of encouraging a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of sexual penetration. He also pleaded guilty to possessing obscene articles and the unlawful possession of a laptop, whose discovery led to the detection of the child abuse. The Perth court was told Pendleton's father, Mark Pendleton, a former pre-primary schoolteacher, was serving a 16-year sentence for abusing and indecently recording 11 girls between 1995 and 2000. Police discovered the evidence of some of the sexual abuse by Ryan Pendleton in the videos and images he had downloaded. They found more after a search of his house uncovered hard drives and thumb drives containing the material. Prosecutor Genevieve Cleary called on Judge Catherine O'Brien to look at the higher end of the penalties available for such offences. ``The child pornography offences ... the child abuse squad have said some of these images are the worst they have seen,'' Ms Cleary said. The court was told Pendleton was in a position of trust and had unsupervised access to three girls, aged between 18 months and five years, between November 2007 and October 2008. Ms Cleary said Pendleton had filmed himself abusing the youngest child while she slept in her cot and groomed one by feeding her lollies and then using a lolly to get her to touch his genitals. Judge O'Brien said Pendleton had grown into adulthood with ``no moral compass'' and felt rejected by his parents who were unable to cope with his behavioural problems. He went to live with his mother when his father was jailed. He had felt unwanted after entering foster care in his teenage years, Judge O'Brien said. Pendleton had various fetishes including a fondness for wearing women's clothing and nappies and his offending mirrored that of his father's, she said. Judge O'Brien said Pendleton's offending was ``particularly perverse and debauched'' and was not isolated. She said ``three defenceless, innocent children'' had been subjected to the highest category of perversion and debauchery, as Pendleton viewed the images for his own sexual gratification. Pendleton was in a high risk category of reoffending, with a four in 10 chance of re-offending in a 10-year period, Judge O'Brien said. She said he had lacked insight into the effects of his offending on his victims and had exploited them. Using a lolly to lure his victim into touching his penis was an example of how prepared he was to take advantage of the youth of the child, Judge O'Brien said. Pendleton was sentenced to six years for sexually penetrating one of the girls, 20 months imprisonment for each count of possessing child pornography and two years on each count of indecently dealing and recording the girls, to be served concurrently. He was fined $3000 on each count of possessing obscene articles and given a three month term of imprisonment for unlawful possession of the laptop. The sentence was backdated to November 28 last year. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/pedophile-mark-pendletons-son-jailed-for-abusing-girls/story-e6frg12c-1225737808899

JAY PERKINS (SA - Mawson Lakes)|46 yrs old (2008)|Sentenced in December 2008, in the SA District Court, to 8 months non parole.|Jay Perkins - Pleaded guilty to using a carriage service to access child pornography, an offence under federal law, and to possessing child pornography  a state offence. "Mawson Lakes man jailed for child porn offences" (2-12-2008) A child pornographer whose collection of images was assessed to determine how perverted it was will spend the next eight months behind bars. Jay Perkins, 46, of Mawson Lakes, appeared in the District Court today. He had pleaded guilty to using a carriage service to access child pornography, an offence under federal law, and to possessing child pornography  a state offence. The court had previously allowed Perkins' case to be delayed due to the vast size of his illegal collection. Prosecutors and defence counsel had told the court they needed time to undertake the "unpleasant" task of viewing hundreds of illegal photographs and videos. This had to be done to determine "how perverted" the content of the images was. Today, because of the combination of charges, Judge Geoffrey Muecke imposed two sentences  seven months for the federal offence and 12 months for the state offence. He further ordered Perkins serve a combined eight-month non-parole period  one month for accessing the pornography and seven months for possessing it. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/man-jailed-for-child-porn-offences/story-e6freol3-1111118212824

BRETT LINTON PETTERSEN (Brett Pettersen) (VIC - Bendigo, White Hills)|28 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced Feb 2013, in the Bendigo County Court, to 18 months jail - 9 months non parole.|Brett Linton Pettersen - Pleaded guilty to possessing a collection of more than 1100 videos and images of child pornography, the majority of which depicted children under 10 years old. "Jail term for most graphic child porn" (22-2-2013) A White Hills man has been jailed for 18 months for downloading a collection of child pornography that detectives described as the worst and most graphic they had ever seen. Brett Linton Pettersen, 28, pleaded guilty to possessing a collection of more than 1100 videos and images of child pornography, the majority of which depicted children under 10 years old. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison with a nine-month non-parole period for one charge of possessing and one charge of producing child pornography. The production charge related to Pettersen copying nude pictures of a 14-year-old Bendigo girl and her school friends that he stole from a computer he was fixing while working as an IT technician in 2007. Pettersen was repairing the computer when he found and copied a folder full of explicit pictures the computer owners daughter had taken of herself and friends in various states of undress. Detectives later uncovered the files on Pettersens computer in a raid on his parents White Hills home, where he lives. Members of the Victorian sexual crimes squad said the collection of 1171 movies and images were the most graphic theyd seen, with some films showing children as young as a few months old. Pettersen said he had been downloading the collection of child pornography for a number of years and that he looked at the images and movies every week. Defence lawyer Martine Marich said her client had been on a slippery slope, looking at material online that was increasingly graphic and intended to shock. The Bendigo County Court was told that despite breaching the trust of his employer by copying the pictures of the 14-year-old girl from a clients computer, Pettersen had continued to be employed at Forrest Computing in Epsom. In her sentencing Judge Wendy Wilmoth said the offending deserved a penalty that reflected the seriousness of the crime. Ms Wilmoth said she was able to apply some leniency because of Pettersens lack of criminal history and her belief that he had no paedophilic tendencies. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/1318481/jail-term-for-most-graphic-child-porn/?cs=12|/images/brett_pettersen_2.jpg

DIETER PFENNIG (SA- Adelaide)|yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in 1992, to Life in jail.|Dieter Pfennig/ Convicted child Killer and Paedophile..Jailed in 1992 for the abduction and murder of 10 yr old Murray Bridge schoolboy, Michael Black, in January 1989.. Pfennig pleaded guilty in 1990 to abducting and sexually assaulting a 13 yr old boy. News (2-7-2012)- "Police start digging up backyard in Louise Bell search" Police are digging up an Adelaide backyard after using radar to scan for clues to the 1983 disappearance and suspected murder of Adelaide schoolgirl Louise Bell. Officers brought in on Monday used radar equipment that can penetrate concrete to look for anomalies in the soil at the home once owned by a convicted child killer, which they first searched in 1991. Detective-Superintendent Grant Moyle says police are now excavating sections of the yard, hoping to find evidence or rule out the house as a link to Louise's abduction. The property used to belong to Dieter Pfennig, who was jailed in 1992 for the abduction and murder of a 10-year-old schoolboy whose body was never found. Pfennig remains in custody. In the 1991 search, police pulled up floorboards but excavated only a section of the yard, Supt Moyle said on Tuesday. "Hopefully (we can) unravel some more evidence and bring some closure to the family," he told ABC radio. Louise was abducted from her bedroom in West Hackham in 1983. Her body has never been found and police believe she was murdered. Raymond John Bolte, formerly known as Raymond Geesing, was sentenced in 1983 to life imprisonment for Louise's murder and abduction. His conviction was overturned by the Court of Criminal Appeal two years later and he was released from jail. He was later jailed again for sexually abusing two sisters over an eight-year period in the 1990s. Meanwhile, former forensic police officer Ted Van Dijk, who worked on the initial investigation, is helping unravel details of the crime. Pfennig was jailed for life in 1992 for the murder of Murray Bridge schoolboy Michael Black, 10, but the Louise Bell case remains open. Mr Van Dijk was brought in by Supt Moyle to review all the evidence collected during the original investigation. Major Crime has also called in Australian Federal Police forensic experts with hi-tech ground-penetrating radar to search the backyard of Pfennig's former house on Holly Rise, Hackham West. The equipment can penetrate concrete to locate disturbed ground up to a metre deep. "We will keep using what technology and advances in science (that are) available to us to try to bring this to a conclusion," Supt Moyle said. More than a dozen officers searched the home yesterday, and police expect to remain on site until at least late tomorrow. Lands Title Office records show Pfennig owned the Holly Rise property from 1977 until he was taken into custody but police would not confirm he was "a person of interest". "All I will say is that person (of interest) is in custody," Supt Moyle said. "It's a big commitment. We have examined closely the extent of investigations that were conducted in 1983, when Louise Bell went missing. It is a result of that, that we felt we needed to fully examine the backyard more than they did in 1991." The Louise Bell investigation was re-opened last year because of better DNA technology, police said.http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/missing-girl-yard-search-by-police/story-e6frea6u-1226413891809 http://video.adelaidenow.com.au/2252226276/Louise-Bell-murder-mystery Anyone with any information on Louise Bell's abduction is urged to contact BankSA Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

DAVID ROSS PHILLIPS (QLD- Mudgeeraba)|yrs old|Sentenced to 4.5 yrs jail - To be released after serving 18 months on a suspended sentence.|David Ross Phillips- Pleaded guilty to four charges of possessing child pornography and exploitation material. "Coast man jailed over child porn" (22-2-2013) A photographer hired to take pictures of Nippers at a Gold Coast lifesaving club and who was jailed this week on child pornography charges had been through a screening process and held a Blue Card. Child protection advocates yesterday warned that nothing could be done to prevent perverts from becoming involved in sporting organisations but said banning photography at youth events would be going too far. David Ross Phillips, of Mudgeeraba, was sentenced this week to four-anda-half years in jail but will be released after 18 months on a suspended sentence. He pleaded guilty to four charges of possessing child pornography and exploitation material and two fraud charges unrelated to the lifesaving club. A Surf Life Saving Queensland spokeswoman said Phillips had been immediately restricted from club events involving children in August 2009, when the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian notified them his Blue Card had been suspended. "David Phillips worked at North Burleigh Surf Life Saving Club as the club photographer for three weeks from August 2009 to when his appointment was withdrawn in September 2009," she said. "During that three-week period there were no Nipper activities or events at the club." A Blue Card is a Queensland Government screening system used to determine if someone is eligible to work with children, based on their criminal history. The spokeswoman said the organisation's policy on photography and members' dealings with Nippers was constantly reviewed and kept in line with state legislation. "Unfortunately, no system is fail-safe when it comes to child predators, but SLSQ clubs, branches and state office can ensure that all steps have been taken according to legislation and risk management strategies that we have in place to protect members," she said. It is SLSQ policy that anyone who works with children must go through a screening process and have a Blue Card. It also requires permission, where possible, from a child's parents before taking a photo or publishing it. Bravehearts founder Betty Johnston said banning photography at youth sporting events would be going too far. "When it comes to parents taking photos of their kids playing sport, it's an over-reaction," she said. http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2013/02/22/447649_crime-and-court-news.html
GARRY PHILLIPS (VIC - Bendigo)|58 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in November 2011, in the Bendigo Magistrates Court, to one months jail - wholly suspended for a year.|Garry Phillips - Pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography. "Bendigo man curious of child porn" (10-11-2011) A Bendigo business owner who downloaded almost 400 images of child pornography, including child sex slaves images, has been registered as a sex offender for eight years.Garry Phillips, 58, pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography in Bendigo Magistrates Court on Wednesday.Magistrate Felicity Broughton heard between April 20, 2010, and May 3, 2010, Phillips viewed 398 images of child pornography.Police prosecutor Leading Senior Constable Dave Somerton told the court the pornography included child sex slaves and child sex acts with a child and an adult.He said Phillips used the search engine Google to find the images and some searches lasted between 15 minutes to an hour. The searches were done after business hours when he was alone. When interviewed by police Phillips said he had looked at the images out of curiosity.The court heard the child pornography was found by a computer company when Phillips donated the computer to the company for a computer upgrade.Ms Broughton said despite Phillips privately looking at the images he needed to know every image was a crime scene and every one of the children were being abused. She said people like Phillips provided a market for child pornography. Some of the images were of sadistic and abject behaviour to the most vulnerable children, she said.Ms Broughton said the permanent damage done to the children was well known and the impact was devastating.This sort of industry doesnt exist without an end user, she said. People who view these images provide a market.Ms Broughton said the court and community had a responsibility to care for the most vulnerable members of the community.She said Phillips must understand why possession of child pornography attracted such disgust from the community.She said she was satisfied he was remorseful and at a low risk of reoffending.Phillips was sentenced to one months jail, wholly suspended for a year, and will be a registered sex offender for eight years. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/719827/bendigo-man-curious-of-child-porn/
KEVIN PHILLIPS (QLD - Mackay)|yrs old|Sentenced on 21-4-2011, in the NSW District Court, to 15 months jail - 3 months non parole.|Kevin Phillips - Former Mackay Priest and Teacher - Pleaded guilty to sex offences against a 16-year-old boy at a NSW boarding school in 1990 (St Stanislaus Catholic College)..Pleaded guilty to 4 counts of gross indecency. Kevin Phillips was practising as a priest in Mackay when the charges against him were laid.. He was a priest at four Mackay district Catholic churches including St Patrick's, St Mary's, St Francis Xavier and St Michael's in Sarina. He also served as a priest in Walkerston. "Jail term for priest" (12-5-2011) Former Mackay priest Kevin Phillips has been sentenced to 15 months' jail after he pleaded guilty to sex offences against a 16-year-old boy at a NSW boarding school in 1990. Phillips was sentenced on April 21 this year in the NSW District Court; however, the Daily Mercury can now reveal his identity after a suppression order preventing its release was lifted. Judge Penelope Hock had placed a non-publication order in respect to naming Phillips, but ordered it to be lifted at the conclusion of the trial of Peter Dwyer, a former headmaster at the same boarding school. On Monday, Dwyer was cleared of charges relating to alleged assaults against students at St Stanislaus College in Bathurst between 1977 and 1992. Dwyer had pleaded not guilty to 10 offences, including indecent assault and having sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16. Phillips was a member of the Vincentian community at St Stanislaus Catholic College in 1990 as well as a part-time teacher and sports coach. He was practising as a priest in Mackay when the charges against him were laid. He was a priest at four Mackay district Catholic churches including St Patrick's, St Mary's, St Francis Xavier and St Michael's in Sarina. He also served as a priest in Walkerston. On December 3 last year in the NSW District Court, Phillips pleaded guilty to four counts of gross indecency with the boy between May and December 1990. The agreed facts were that Phillips was assigned in April 1990 to be the boy's mentor for evening prayer sessions. The abuse began when Phillips allowed the boy and a friend to drink whisky in his room. He exposed himself and performed a sexual act in the presence of the boys. On an evening that May, the boy went to Phillips' room where he read from a sex eduction book and asked the boy about his sexual experience. Thereafter, the complainant visited the offender's room several times each week, the facts to the court stated. In an incident in June, the priest and boy conducted sexual acts on each other. On the first three counts of gross indecency, Phillips was sentenced to a concurrent term of imprisonment of nine months, ending on January 20, 2012. Judge Hock said no non-parole periods were set as it would serve no useful purpose. On the final charge, Phillips was sentenced to nine months imprisonment beginning on October 21 and ending on July 20, 2012 with a non-parole period of three months. Upon his release, Phillips can return to Queensland if he chooses after Ms Hock ordered that his parole not be subject to supervision. http://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/mackay-priest-jailed-for-sex-acts-with-teen-jail/847276/

Victim was a woman (teenage hitchiker). Tied the teenager up/ gagged/ repeatedly raped her. Priors in 1984- abduction/ rape of a young woman in ACT- 7 yrs- released in 1988/ 1988- 3 yrs jail (attacked a woman). The prosecution is trying to have Phillips declared a dangerous criminal by the courts- Which means he can be held in custody indefinitely.  News (26-3-2012)- "Worst criminals able to reoffend" Some of Tasmania's worst criminals are reoffending after the court refuses to declare them dangerous criminals a classification that gives judges the power to jail them indefinitely. There are seven declared dangerous criminals in Tasmania, being mostly child abusers and serial rapists. Beyond Abuse spokesman Steve Fisher said it appeared either the Director of Public Prosecutions was not making enough dangerous prisoner applications to the court or the court was rejecting too many. The Supreme Court in 2003 refused a prosecution application to declare child sex abuser Anthony John Minney, of Launceston, a dangerous criminal, yet he was jailed last September for 14 months after pleading guilty to loitering near children. Minney has a long history of sexually assaulting children and last year asked police to send him to prison. In 2003 Justice Ewan Crawford said Minney's child sex abuse case was ``not sufficiently exceptional" to justify making a dangerous criminal order. "Seven people (declared dangerous) across the whole of Tasmania does not seem to indicate they are using the tool at their disposal enough," Mr Fisher said. "The dangerous criminal register was brought in to serve a purpose and that's to do exactly that to keep them off the street." Late last year convicted serial rapist Kevin Richard Bell failed in his bid to have his dangerous criminal order overturned. Bell was sentenced to 12 years' jail in 1991 for six rapes, one indecent assault and four counts of defilement of a young girl. Six months after being paroled in 1998, he committed sex offences against children aged three and 16. Rocherlea man Brendan James Freeman was declared a dangerous criminal in 2004 and sentenced to seven years' jail after admitting to raping and bashing a woman in Launceston. Colin John Sparkes (1997) was also placed on the list after being convicted of burglary with intent to rape. Other criminals the DPP has applied to have placed on the dangerous criminal register include Ian John Brumby (2002) who had committed assault, robbery and rape, and serial rapist Paul Vincent Phillips (1998).http://www.theadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/worst-criminals-able-to-reoffend/2500119.aspx ABC Premium News (11-12-2006)- "Rapist To Be Allowed Day Releases"- The Tasmanian Parole Board has recommended that twice-convicted rapist Paul Vincent Phillips be allowed out of jail on day releases. Phillips has served eight years of a 10-year sentence for the abduction and rape of a hitchhiker at Cygnet. The board turned down his application for parole because he had not had any day releases. In October, the Director of Public Prosecutions failed to have Phillips jailed indefinitely as a dangerous criminal. Phillips can re-apply for parole in three months.

PALAKORN PHINTHONG (WA - Thai national)|26 yrs old (2011)|Sentence - see news article on file.|Palakorn Phinthong - Pleaded guilty to 2 counts of possessing child pornography in November 2010. "Child porn importer eligle for parole after winning appeal" (16-9-2011) A Thai man convicted of importing child pornography into WA is now eligible for parole after winning an appeal against his sentence. Palakorn Phinthong, 26, was originally sentenced to serve 25 months in jail after pleading guilty to two counts of possessing child pornography in November last year. But lawyers acting on behalf of the Thai national appealed the decision arguing the trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion by failing to make a finding that the material found in one charge was the same in the other. Last month the Supreme Court granted the appeal and ordered that Phinthongs sentences be carried out concurrently. Details of the decision were only published today. Originally the 26-year-old would have served a minimum of 14 months however a new sentence was made ordering a minimum of nine months be served and a $5000 recognisance be imposed. Taking into account he had been in custody since November 12, 2010, the Supreme Court ordered Phinthong be released on recognisance after having served 9 months imprisonment, on the same terms and conditions as were previously imposed. Phinthong was eligible for parole on August 8. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/child-porn-importer-eligle-for-parole-after-winning-appeal/story-e6frg143-1226139352585
RODNEY PHIPPS (NSW)|39 yrs old (2007)|Sentenced in the District Court for 14 years jail.|Rodney Phipps - Paedophile - 16 separate counts of sexual assault. "Stepfather: daughter a sex slave" (27-5-2007) A teenage schoolgirl was forced to become a sex slave for four years by her violent, controlling stepfather, a Sydney court has heard. The stepfather, whom a judge described as "manipulative'', exploited the girl's fears for her mother's and sisters' safety to ensure she never reported his vile attacks on her. The extraordinary story of the young woman's five-year fight for justice emerged last week after Rodney Phipps, 39, was jailed in the District Court for 14 years on 16 separate counts of sexual assault. The young victim persuaded the judge to remove a court suppression order so her boastful, self-obsessed tormentor could be publicly named. Judge John Goldring said he wanted "to send a message to all stepfathers that this type of behaviour will be severely punished by the courts''. He said Phipps, a former soldier and mobile phone salesman, was lucky his crimes had been committed before the maximum jail term for such offences had been doubled to 20 years. The judge said Phipps' crimes amounted to ``the worst type of sexual servitude''. He said Phipps had ``manipulated his stepdaughter to become his sexual slave''. In an exclusive interview, she told The Sunday Telegraph she wanted to show other young women caught in a similar sexual trap that they could escape from such nightmares. "I wanted people to know about this sort of crime - so many people just don't know about it,'' Lois (not her real name) said. "Only five or six per cent of these people get caught and sentenced. It's also good to know the justice system does work sometimes''. Shortly after Phipps moved into Lois's life, as her mum's de facto, his charming salesman's veneer began to slip, exposing a cunning and violent side. One day, when no one else was at home at their western Sydney address, Phipps came into her bedroom and sexually assaulted the then 12-year-old. He threatened violence if she told anyone and she had already seen what he did to her mother, the court heard. Later, he exploited different fears: he said he wouldn't hurt her mum any more nor "do it to my sisters'', if she went along with his assaults. According to Lois, Phipps controlled her life and all their lives. He forced her older sisters to leave home; he forced her to leave school. According to the girl's victim impact statement, Phipps later started to bribe her. At times he allowed her requests as long as she agreed to have sex with him. Her mother was on shift work, her older sisters had moved out, the younger children were asleep. Later, she came to think that she was in a relationship with the man more than twice her age. "Phipps always used to tell me: `No one will love you like I do. Boys your age will just use you','' she said, in her victim impact statement. Judge Goldring noted: "The offender was the only father figure in the victim's life and she had no other father figure. "This relationship evolved into an emotion-dependency relationship - the worst type of sexual servitude.'' He added: "Dependency of this type is not uncommon''. Judge Goldring said it was not in dispute that Phipps and the then 16-year-old Lois later "intended to live together'', such was his control over her. "The offender had manipulated his stepdaughter to become his sexual slave,'' he said. After Phipps was jailed briefly over other matters, he wrote 19 "telling'' letters to Lois. Her mother intercepted one and, horrified by its contents, urged Lois to speak to the police. She resisted at first but eventually agreed. Then came a four-year wait, a delay while Phipps pursued a range of legal options, including seeking to be excused from being charged because he was not mentally fit to stand trial. For Lois and other witnesses, it meant four years of not discussing the case with each other, for fear that these talks might "taint'' their evidence in the trial; and four years of putting up with the frustration of repeated adjournments. In her victim impact statement to the court, Lois wrote: "I feel I have missed out on my childhood. I was not allowed out with friends, not allowed to have a boyfriend, he made me stay at home ...'' Now that chapter is over and she said last week: "I can finally start my life again''. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/stepfather-daughter-a-sex-slave/story-e6frewt0-1111113618250|/images/rodney_phipps_2.jpg

"Pedophile priest Terrence Melville Pidoto refused appeal request" (27-6-2009) A priest jailed for more than seven years for raping and sexually abusing four boys has been refused leave to appeal his convictions. A Victorian County Court jury in 2007 found Catholic priest Terrence Melville Pidoto guilty of 11 charges including rape and indecently assaulting a child under 16. He was jailed later that year for seven years and three months, and ordered to serve a minimum of five years before being eligible for parole. Today, the Court of Appeal refused him leave to appeal his convictions. His lawyers had argued the judge made errors during his trial. But Justices Peter Buchanan, Frank Vincent and Julie Dodds-Streeton said the trial judge had acted appropriately. We are far from persuaded that any of the verdicts could be regarded as unreasonable,'' they said in their judgment. Pidoto was ordained in 1971 aged 26 and began his sordid sex activity just a year later, the jury heard during his trial. They heard he took one 14-year-old boy to the Corpus Christi seminary, in Melbourne's east, where he raped and abused him on several occasions between 1972 and 1973. Assaults on two 15-year-old boys occurred at St Clare's Catholic parish in Box Hill in 1978 and 1979, while Pidoto was an assistant parish priest. A 12-year-old boy became Pidoto's fourth victim after the priest officiated at the boy's sister's wedding. Pidoto had denied all charges. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/pedophile-priest-terrence-melville-pidoto-refused-appeal-request/story-e6frf7jo-1225755261285 http://www.cvsa.com.au/?p=452 http://brokenrites.alphalink.com.au/nletter/page136-pidoto.html|/images/terrence_melville_pidoto.jpg

Daniel Pilla appeared at Frankston Magistrates' Court last week and held his head in his hands as details of his offending were read out in court. Magistrate Graham Keil branded Pilla's actions "sickening" and ordered psychiatric reports. Prosecutor Ken Hardie told the court Pilla, 23, had been drinking at his mate's home in April this year. In the early hours of the morning Pilla entered the victim's room and woke her before leading her into the living room. He went to the kitchen pantry where he retrieved a box of chocolates that he used to try to persuade the girl to take part in sexual activity. The next day his victim told her mother what had happened. Pilla, from Rosebud, will be sentenced next month. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/chocolate-used-to-lure-girl-3/story-fn7x8me2-1226213070156

Piromalli indecently touched a 5 yr old girl at Joondalup shopping centre in Jan 2009. The offence was captured on security vision. News (18-2-2010)- "Community sentence for indecent conviction"- A 26 year old man has been given a community based sentence for indecently touching a five year old girl at a Joondalup shopping centre. Adrian Piromalli pleaded guilty to touching the girl's bottom in the toy section of a department store in January last year. The District Court was told reports indicated Piromalli did not have an inappropriate sexual interest in children and he was a low risk of re-offending. Judge Felicity Davis placed Piromalli on a 15 month community based sentence with a requirement that he receive counselling and treatment. Outside the court, Piromalli's lawyer Michael Clarke said his client would now be placed on a sex offenders register. "It means essentially the police need to know where you're living, you need to know when you move, you need to check in every so often and essentially you wind up on a list that the public's trying to get a hold of, and I just think this is another example of these laws applying too broadly." http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/18/2823766.htm?site=perth&section=news|/images/adrian_piromalli_1.jpg

Pleaded guilty to 2 counts of aggravated sexual intercourse occasioning actual bodily harm, one charge of special aggravation break, enter and committing a serious indictable offence and a further sexual assault charge. News (18-2-2011)- "Tuross Head rapist leaves legacy of fear" An undercurrent of fear still exists in the Tuross Head community, despite this weeks jailing of a savage rapist. Tony Piscitelli, 24, was sentenced on Monday to 16-and-a-half-years jail for the vicious rape of an 83-year-old woman in her Tuross Head home last April. The savage and callous attack was almost in the worst case category of aggravated sexual assault, according to Wollongong District Court Judge David Frearson. The sentence came as a relief for many Tuross residents, most of whom were happy to close the chapter and move on. However, speaking to the Bay Post/Moruya Examiner, some said there was still an undercurrent of fear and nervous tension, felt particularly by the villages many elderly residents. I never thought that it would happen here, in Tuross, one woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, said. I moved here with mum in 86 and you could walk the streets at night with no problems. Not now, there are too many louts and loons about at night. A few streets over, another man said, despite feeling no personal danger, his elderly neighbours were constantly afraid. We didnt have any (street) lights along here until recently, he said. Thats made a huge difference. They come out of the pubs and walk this way, yelling and making noises. The police are too far away, and the old ones are too afraid to speak out. Im not though, I come out and yell at them, get them to move on. The general consensus was that Tuross needs a stronger police presence. With the closest 24-hour police station at Batemans Bay - 40 minutes away - residents still feel vulnerable. People who didnt lock their doors before (the attack) probably do now, and thats not a bad thing, another woman said. But it would be a great weight off the minds of many if Tuross had its own police station. These problems arent going away, something has to be done. http://www.batemansbaypost.com.au/news/local/news/general/tuross-head-rapist-leaves-legacy-of-fear/2079720.aspx News (16-2-2011)- "Savage rapist behind bars" A Tuross Head man who raped an 83-year-old woman and repeatedly slammed her head against a wall during a drug and booze-fuelled attack will spend more than 10 years behind bars. Tony Piscitelli, 24, was sentenced to a total of 16-and-a-half years jail for the vicious attack on the elderly woman in April last year. Wollongong District Court Judge David Frearson this week described Mr Piscitellis actions as a savage and callous attack that was almost in the worst case category of aggravated sexual assault. Mr Piscitelli pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse occasioning actual bodily harm, one charge of special aggravation break, enter and committing a serious indictable offence and a further sexual assault charge. He admitted he broke into the womans Tuross Head unit in April last year and, upon discovering her alone in the bathroom, put a hand over her mouth and said: Dont make noise, Im not going to hurt you. However, Mr Piscitelli then pulled the woman into the bedroom and raped her twice, despite her repeated pleas for him to stop. During the ordeal he told her he had a knife, and at another time, asked her if she was enjoying it. When he was finished, Mr Piscitelli made the woman sit against a brick wall before he slammed her head against it four to five times. The court heard the woman, who suffered from asthma, was also having trouble breathing and asked Mr Piscitelli to get her puffer when he finally stopped. He left the room but did not return, and soon after the woman alerted neighbours, who contacted police. Mr Piscitelli told the court during sentencing submissions last Friday that he consumed seven or eight beers, smoked 15 cones of cannabis and had two sleeping tablets before the incident and did not remember much of it. He initially denied knowledge of the crime when spoken to by police, however conceded his involvement when DNA swabs pinned him as the rapist. Judge Frearson said Mr Piscitellis record showed numerous convictions for dishonesty and assault. He also acknowledged Mr Piscitelli began using illicit drugs at 10 and was himself sexually assaulted at age 12. Judge Frearson acknowledged that Mr Piscitelli accepted responsibility for his crimes and was remorseful and ashamed, but said it didnt excuse his actions. The victim impact statement was extremely distressing ... The victim was frail and vulnerable, Judge Frearson said. Piscitellis non-parole period of 11 and a half years includes one year of time already served. He will be eligible for parole in October, 2021. http://www.batemansbaypost.com.au/news/local/news/general/savage-rapist-behind-bars/2076898.aspx

News (14-11-2012)- "Violent sex offender jailed for 11 years" A violent sex offender who attacked five women and children has been deemed a danger to society and sentenced to more than 11 years in prison. Jason Bradley Pool, a father of two who lived in Western Australia's southwest, pleaded guilty to 15 charges involving victims ranging in age from seven to 37 - mostly young teenagers. The attacks between 2005 and 2011 included offences of indecent dealings with children, indecent assault, attempted indecent recordings, burglary and aggravated sexual penetration. Sentencing Pool in the Perth District Court on Tuesday to 11 years and nine months in jail, Judge Bruce Goetze said the 42-year-old's attacks had escalated in violence over the years. "You have no respect for the invasion of someone's personal rights and sexual integrity, and you have no respect for the invasion of someone's dwelling in which they're staying," he said. "Put simply, you're a danger to society." Details of Pool's crimes recounted in court included cutting a girl's clothes off her body and filming himself molesting her, filming a girl naked in the shower, and taking advantage of children he was babysitting. "They were in your care for the evening, and one can expect you to have taken care of them and not to have offended in this way," Judge Goetze said. However, he said Pool had shown genuine remorse by pleading guilty. In a letter, Pool wrote: "No one deserves to be treated that way. I shocked myself and did not offend again. Four months later I was arrested." Noting the victim impact statements, Judge Goetze said some of the victims had severe issues with trust, were still living in fear, felt they were being watched, and needed counselling. He said one victim even thought she was going to die during Pool's attack on her and another victim no longer felt comfortable in her own home. Judge Goetze said Pool had shown a "significant diversity of sexual offending" and was a high risk of re-offending. He will be eligible to be considered for parole after serving nine years and nine months in prison. His sentence was backdated to January 31. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/violent-sex-offender-jailed-for-11-years/story-e6freono-1226516847523

Pleaded guilty to exposing a child to an indecent act,breaching bail (approached the child in schoolyard while he was on bail). Victim was a 6 yr old female student. News (18-12-2011)- "Former teacher Troy Darren Porter faces jail for stalking schoolgirl"- Teacher Troy Darren Porter was convicted of indecent treatment of a young student two years ago, but walked free from court. He escaped jail because he had already been in custody for 248 days leading up to his trial for exposing the then six-year-old girl to indecent acts. He was, however, ordered to stay away from the student. The Attorney-General appealed the sentence, saying it was too lenient. The appeal was unsuccessful. But if the appeal had been upheld and Porter had been locked up, the victim and her family would have been spared the trauma of Porter's sick obsession, because he started stalking the girl again. Fifteen months after the judge told him to stay away, Porter showed up at the girl's school swimming carnival. On November 18 last year, he left his parents' Sunshine Coast home, which has a swimming pool, and drove 90km past 29 public pools to the Brisbane leisure centre where the girl was swimming with her class. Porter then walked past the girl, who is now 10, winking at her as she waited for friends outside a change room. On December 9, Brisbane Magistrate Judith Daley found Porter had deliberately planned his trip to the leisure centre in November last year, knowing the girl's Year 5 class would be there. A Taskforce Argos police investigation discovered that Porter found out where the girl would be by accessing a newsletter about the swimming carnival on her school website, a favourite site on his internet search engine. The court heard Porter first met the girl as a trusted primary school teacher who had befriended her parents, sometimes sleeping over at the family's house and having them stay at his home. His obsession with the girl was even evident while he was on bail awaiting sentencing for the original offence. He went to the girl's new school and called her over to the fence. When Porter was sentenced in August 2009 for indecent treatment of the girl, he was freed but ordered to have no contact with her for two years and not to go within 200m of her school. This time he is likely to go to prison. Magistrate Daley found Porter guilty of breaching the non-contact order and he is now waiting to be sentenced in Brisbane District Court. Porter has been released on bail. Police also are seeking a civil order that could bar him from going near the girl or contacting her in future. Hetty Johnstone of child protection group Bravehearts said the Attorney-General had been proved right and Porter should be jailed. "This is highly predatory behaviour and a red flag,'' Ms Johnstone said. "He is stalking this little girl and harassing her. "The court must respond accordingly, in favour of this little girl, and lock this guy away.'' Porter now works at a Sunshine Coast liquor barn. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/teacher-faces-jail-for-stalking-girl/story-e6freoof-1226224867291|/images/troy_porter_2.jpg
EVGENY POTASHNIK (VIC- Bentleigh)|31 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to a 5 months jail - suspended for a yr and an 18-month community service order.|Evgeny Potashnik - pleaded guilty to 2 counts of knowingly possessing child pornography. News (18-3-2011)- "Online pedophile cheats jail" The Australian-based "security adviser" to the largest online pedophile network ever busted has escaped a jail term after being sentenced to community service for his senior role in a ring that traded millions of child-exploitation images, with some made to order. Melbourne-based IT consultant Evgeny Potashnik, 30, was one of four Australians to hold high-level positions in the international "boylover" online forum, which had more than 70,000 members in at least 30 countries. An Australian Federal Police-led investigation, started three years ago, has led to the arrest of 184 people - including 31 Australians - over that time as well as the rescue of 230 children from suspected abuse. Four of those children are from Australia, with police around the world still trying to locate victims - some of whom are infants and have experienced the "worst of the worst" in abuse. Police also suspect members were running orphanages in Thailand, where an 84-year-old Australian was tracked through the forum and charged with physically abusing children. Details of the three-year investigation and the subsequent charges were announced late on Wednesday night in The Hague, with AFP commander Grant Edwards joining his European counterparts in detailing the investigation involving Australian police infiltrating the sophisticated network. Police said the Netherlands-based forum, believed to have been set up in 2002 and shut down in the bust, purported to be a discussion-only website about member's shared sexual interest in boys. But the forum was a front for the trade in child-exploitation images and film. Mr Edwards said the network was run with a corporate-like structure, headed by an "owner" and a "board of directors". Members, including Potashnik and three other Australians, were promoted on the basis of their contribution to the website and contacts up the structure. Police said five Australian men arrested in NSW, Western Australian and Victoria were "high-ranking members" of the network, with two Sydney men holding the positions of director. One was charged with child sex tourism and child pornography offences, receiving a non-parole jail term of three years and seven months; the other was convicted of child abuse and producing child pornography and recently had his jail term reduced to six years and three months. Potashnik, of Bentleigh, pleaded guilty to two counts of knowingly possessing child pornography and was given a five-month sentence, suspended for a year and an 18-month community service order.

News (27-5-2009)- "Gym coach jailed for sex with girl, 12" A Gymnastics coach, described as a lonely young man, has been jailed for four years for having sex with a 12-year-old girl when he was aged 24. Dean Oliver Prall, who was today sentenced in the District Court in Perth to 21 sexual offences against the girl, told a counsellor he wouldnt have started the relationship with the girl if she hadn't ``flirted with him first. Judge Stephen Scott said Prall, who was a coach at a suburban Police and Citizens Youth Centre, had known the girl for about two or three years before he developed a sexual attraction to her. Judge Scott said the relationship started when Prall began sending her sexually explicit mobile phone text messages and then the two started a physical relationship between June and September last year. They had sex at least 15 times at her parents house with one of the sex acts taking place after Prall was charged and while he was on bail, he said. Judge Scott said Prall, who wept and shook in the dock during the hearing, had known the age of the girl and had undertaken ``significant grooming of her and her parents so that the relationship might continue. The court heard Prall had fathered a child at the age of 17 with a woman who was aged 14 or 15 at the time. He described himself as bisexual, having had a long term sexual relationship with a man. A psychologists report suggested Prall had blamed the girl for the relationship, saying that he "went along with the sex at her suggestion and had she not flirted with him, he "would not have reciprocated. Another report said Prall was "emotionally immature and a "lonely, young man who acted inappropriately with the "attention of a pretty girl. But Judge Scott said despite Pralls medium to low chance of reoffending and clean record, he deserved to go to the jail because he should have known he was an adult and young girls could have a crush on older people. Prall will be eligible for parole in November next year with time served. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/gym-coach-jailed-for-sex-with-girl-12/story-e6frg12c-1225716929220 http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/coach-had-sex-with-girl-while-on-bail-20081121-6dkn.html (21-11-2008) News (14-11-2008)- "Convicted paedophile on fresh child sex charges" A child sex offender has appeared in a Perth Court, accused of committing new offences against the same victim while on bail.

MATTHEW JONATHON PRATT (QLD- Brisbane)|29 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 12-4-2012, in the Brisbane's District Court, to 2 yrs jail- sentence suspended.|Matthew Pratt- Repeat Offender. Pleaded guilty in Brisbane's District Court to one count each of using the internet to procure a child under the age of 12 and a child under the age of 16, and possessing child exploitation material. Prior History of sexual offences going back 11 yrs. Man lived in a 'sexual fantasy world': judge (12-4-2012) A former Brisbane travel agent was found in possession of child pornography after he was sprung at an internet cafe chatting online to two young girls, a court has heard. Matthew Jonathon Pratt, 29, who has previous convictions for sexual offences dating back 11 years, pleaded guilty in Brisbane's District Court today to one count each of using the internet to procure a child under the age of 12 and a child under the age of 16 and possessing child exploitation material. The court heard Pratt was reeling from a relationship breakdown when he logged onto a teen chat room at Elysium Cafe on Brunswick Street, Fortitude Valley on February 26, 2011. The then-28-year-old chatted for about one hour with two girls aged 11 and 12 from the United States until he was sprung by the manager of the cafe who called police, the court heard. Police later seized Pratt's laptop from his home in Spring Hill where they found six short movies containing images of children aged between eight and 14 in their underwear as well as 40 images containing child exploitation material. Two of the films found on Pratt's computer were among one of the worst categories of child exploitation material, but lasted only several seconds, Crown prosecutor Carson Lloyd said. In sentencing Pratt, Judge Marshall Irwin noted the 29-year-old had no real intentions of meeting the children. "You logged on to a teen chat website actively looking to communicate with pre-teen girls," he said before detailing Pratt's sexually-explicit postings. The court heard Pratt was convicted at the age of 18 of masturbating in public place where school children were present, as well as the sexual assault of a young woman in New Zealand. "There are obviously serious aspects of your offending," Judge Irwin said. "You deliberately sought out children in this age group for your own sexual gratification. "You seemed to be living in a sexual fantasy world and those internet communications were a part of those fantasies." Defence barrister Doug Wilson, for Pratt, said his client suffered high levels of depression, anxiety and stress, but had undergone extensive counselling to address the issues that led to his offending. "Strangely [in circumstances like these], Mr Pratt has a secure relationship with a mature-age woman ... and she has noticed he has taken control of his life," Mr Wilson said, pointing to Pratt's girlfriend of one year sitting in the public gallery. "[A term of imprisonment] would harm the prospects of him not re-offending because of the steps he has taken in rehabilitation." Mr Wilson said Pratt had resigned from his position as a travel agent with Flight Centre ahead of today's court proceedings and taken up a role as an account manager at a contracting firm. Judge Irwin said the community would be best served if Pratt continued in his rehabilitation efforts. He sentenced Pratt to two years' imprisonment, to be wholly suspended, and instructed that he be monitored under a probation order for that time. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/man-lived-in-a-sexual-fantasy-world-judge-20120412-1wver.html#ixzz1xqCdpYWp

News (18-2-2011)- "Jail for child predator" A Canberra man who planned to have sex with a 12-year-old child he met on the internet, will serve another six months in jail. Alan Winston Priest, 60, pleaded guilty in the ACT Supreme Court to using a carriage service to procure a young person. An undercover Australian Federal Agent, pretending to be a 12-year-old boy called Jamie, chatted to Priest online during April and May 2008. Priest, aged 57 at the time, told Jamie his age and spoke explicitly to him about sex. He organised to meet the boy at the Lyneham shops saying: "All I ask is you never tell anyone, not even your best friend. I would be in big trouble if anyone found out." Priest cancelled the initial meeting telling Jamie, "If you are not who you say you are, I am in big trouble." But Priest soon organised another meeting, telling Jamie, "If anyone says anything, I am your uncle and you are my nephew." Police arrested Priest at the Lyneham shops in May 2008. The crown argued the case called for a punishment of specific and general deterrence. The lawyer said, "The evidence is clear. Mr Priest ...knew what he was doing, knew it was wrong and illegal. He nevertheless persisted." Priest's defence lawyer argued his client had undergone the Adult Sex Offenders Program and he was anxious to continue treatment. Justice Hilary Penfold sentenced Priest to three years and nine months imprisonment, backdated to August 2010. Priest will be eligible for parol in August this year. http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/18/3142979.htm?site=news http://the-riotact.com/dunlop-man-charged-with-child-sex-offences/7483
GEOFFREY JOHN PRIGGE (NSW- Mosman)|57 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced November 2010, in the Sydney District Court, to 15 months jail - to be released in Feb 2012.|Geoffrey Prigge/ Child sex tourist. Found guilty of 5 charges- Victims were 3 Nepalese boys aged 13 and 14. Also found guilty of possessing child pornography. Child Wise (16-11-2010)- "Outrage at sentence of predatory sex offender"- Child Wise, Australias leading international child protection charity are outraged at the 15 month jail term handed down to convicted Australian child sex tourist Geoffrey John Prigge. On 12 November, Geoffrey Prigge, 55 of Mosman, was the first Australian convicted of child sex tourism offences in Nepal. At the trial at the District Court in Sydney, Prigge was found guilty of five charges related to indecent touching and attempted acts of indecency involving three Nepalese boys aged 13 and 14. Prigge was also found guilty of possessing child pornography in his home in Mosman. Prigge reportedly helped to set up an orphanage in Nepal and was known as a "man of charity". The offences were part of a "careful grooming process" that started when he visited Nepal on a previous occasion and took indecent photographs of boys. Returning to Nepal in 2007, he committed the offences as he showed the victims indecent pictures and a pornographic film in his hotel room. http://www.childwise.net/images/stories/documents/Media_releases/Geoffrey_John_Prigge_16_November_2010.pdf News (15-11-2010)- "Nepal charity work hid predator's sex abuse of children"- He helped set up an orphanage in Nepal and was known as a "man of charity". But there was a darker side to Geoffrey John Prigge's interest in children, said the judge who jailed him for molesting teenage boys. Prigge, 55, of Mosman, was the first Australian convicted of child sex-tourism offences committed while in Nepal. He was charged under legislation allowing Australians who offend overseas to be investigated by the Australian Federal Police and prosecuted at home. At his trial in the District Court in Sydney, a jury found him guilty of five charges related to indecent touching and attempted acts of indecency involving three Nepalese boys aged 13 and 14. He also pleaded guilty to the possession of child pornography at his home in Mosman. Sentencing him on Friday, Judge John Nicholson said that to his friends and relatives, Prigge was community-oriented and gregarious, but "to three Nepalese boys  he presented as a predatory, manipulative paedophile". The offences were part of a "careful grooming process" that began on an earlier visit to Nepal when Prigge, a photographer and charity worker, took indecent photographs of boys, the judge said. Returning in 2007, he committed the offences as he showed the victims indecent pictures and a pornographic film in his hotel room. The court was told the Nepalese appreciate the value of tourism. Judge Nicholson said the boys, who came to Sydney to give evidence, sought to welcome Prigge and downplay his sexual interest in them to accommodate a foreign visitor. The difference in the financial status of tourists from a First-World country and the local population helped create a "tidal wave of power abuse", the judge said, adding that Prigge's crimes were "a serious abuse of power". The federal police's national co-ordinator of child protection operations, Alison Wegg, said that even abroad, Australians were not beyond the reach of federal law. Intervening before children are harmed is a key strategy for the federal police, who can cancel the passports of suspected child sex tourists. Under new laws, planning a child sex-tourism offence or grooming or procuring a child for sexual activity overseas is punishable by up to 15 years in jail. Prigge will serve 15 months behind bars, to be released in February 2012. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/nepal-charity-work-hid-predators-sex-abuse-of-children-20101114-17sq2.html  Name: JAMES ANTON PROVAN  (VIC- Thornbury)|44 yrs old |Sentenced in Dec 2004 to a 2 yr community based order/continue psychiatric treatment/ Placed on sex offender register for 8 yrs. |Pleaded guilty to 1 charge of possessing child pornography, on the 10-10-2004 in the Heidelberg Magistrates Court.Ex- Psychologist.child pornography (sexually explicit) 114 images of boys (aged between 8-14 yrs old), were found on his home computer.

News (9-10-2003)- Rapist jailed for nine years - A rapist who attacked a 27-year-old woman in her bed in a Geelong motel room was today jailed for nine years. Victorian County Court Judge Leo Hart ordered 38-year-old Deryk John Pruckl to serve a minimum non-parole term of six years. Judge Hart said the woman's ordeal, which lasted for about an hour, "must have seemed like an eternity". Armed with a cricket bat and a knife, he entered the woman's room in the Corio motel on February 21 last year after finding the key had been left in the lock. An amphetamine addict, Pruckl had been prowling the area intent on burglary and theft, the court heard. He attacked the woman when she awoke as he entered the room. Judge Hart said the victim was tied up and subjected to a "terrifying and disgusting ordeal". At one point she fought off Pruckl and tried to escape, but he threw her to the floor and threatened her with the knife. He escaped, taking with him the woman's mobile phone, a credit card and some cash.Last July, Pruckl was extradited from South Australia's Port Augusta prison and later pleaded guilty to three counts of rape, false imprisonment, aggravated burglary, theft, indecent assault and intentionally causing injury. He was originally charged with 15 counts of rape. The judge said that Pruckl, a shearer for 14 years until an injury forced him to stop work two or three years ago, had a history of dabbling in drugs. http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/09/1065601954700.html
PETER PRYSE (VIC- Bendigo)|35 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to a minimum of 3 yrs jail in 2004/5. Placed on the sex offender register for life.|Paedophile- convicted 4 counts of committing an indecent act with, or in the presence of a child under 16. Pryse indecently assaulted a 6 yr old girl, and a 7 yr old boy in 2004. News (4-5-2012)- "Sex offender denied bail in Bendigo court"- A convicted child sex offender who police believe is at very high risk of re-offending has had his bid for freedom denied. Peter Pryse, 35, faced Bendigo Magistrates Court yesterday charged with three contraventions of the sex offender register. Pryse was placed on the sex offender register for life after being convicted of indecently assaulting a six-year-old girl and a seven-year-old boy in 2004. Police arrested Pryse on Wednesday night when it was found he was living with two six-year-old boys, the sons of his partner, without notifying authorities. He had also failed to tell police about a motorbike he had purchased in 2008 and a change of address. Anyone on the sex offender register must comply with a strict set of conditions including notifying police of a long list of personal details. Police informant Detective Senior Constable Fisher said Pryse had broken these conditions twice before, once for failing to disclose personal details and another time for living with a child without notifying police. Pryces defence counsel Peter Baker said he understood his client would be facing jail time for this third breach but applied for bail until the matter was finalised. The ultimately unsuccessful application was opposed by police who argued Pryse was at serious risk of re-offending while on bail. The risk of a registered sex offender re-offending is categorised as low, medium and high  he is listed as very high, Detective Fisher said of Pryse. Detective Fisher said he was frightened by the fact Pryse had lived on and off with his girlfriend and her twin boys since the start of the year. He said Pryse had only told the woman half the story in regards to his offending. He told her he revealed himself to a young girl when he was drunk, he said. The reality, Magistrate Jennifer Tregent said, was much more concerning. Pryse was remanded to appear in the Bendigo Magistrates Court on May 30. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/crime-and-law/sex-offender-denied-bail-in-bendigo-court/2544214.aspx News (23-9-2010)- "Child sex offender cops fine"- A Bendigo man with a conviction for sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl appeared in the magistrates court this week charged with failing to comply with the sex offender registry. In the early 2000s, Peter Pryse, 34, was convicted of four counts of committing an indecent act with, or in the presence of, a child under 16. He was sentenced to a minimum of three years in jail and listed as a serious sex offender. Earlier this year Pryse was interviewed by police and charged after he was found to have an unauthorised internet account. Serious sex offenders listed on the registry must notify their case worker of their personal circumstances, providing their address, phone number and internet provider details. They must also declare any access they have with children, whether its through a new relationship, their employment or their involvement with a sports club. Pryse did not notify his case worker about his internet access. He pleaded guilty to the charge in the Bendigo Magistrates Court on Tuesday. During the plea hearing, the court was told that in July Pryse had also been convicted of failing to notify the registry about his contact with a young child. There was no suggestion that he sexually assaulted the child. On that matter, Pryse was sentenced to one month in jail, suspended for 12 months.

"Convicted rapist Howard William Purcell seeks retrial over his police interview" (5-10-2010) A man who was convicted of dragging a woman off the street and violently raping her in one of Brisbane's most popular inner-city parks wants a new trial because of the way police conducted an interview with him. Lawyers for Howard William Purcell, 31, were in the Court of Appeal appealing his conviction and a 12-year jail sentence imposed in the District Court earlier this year. Purcell's trial heard a 36-year-old woman had been drinking with friends at the New Farm bowls club in August 2007 when she left to walk the short distance home. As she walked down Brunswick Street Purcell grabbed the woman by her arms and dragged her struggling and screaming into bushes across the road to New Farm Park. He punched her in the face twice to subdue her before ripping her jeans and underwear down and raping her. Purcell was arrested a month later for breach of bail and was charged for the offence when his DNA was matched to the offence. In the Court of Appeal, Barrister Megan Power, for Purcell, said her client had not received a fair trial because a tape recording of his police interview had been ruled admissible evidence to go before the jury. She said police had only questioned Purcell about an assault in the park and not about an alleged rape. Ms Power said Purcell had claimed at his trial he had consensual sex with a woman but had not mentioned that during the police interview. It could have given the jury the wrong impression about Purcell. She also argued if Purcell's bid for a new trial was refused his sentence should be reduced to nine years when other cases of street rapes were considered. However, Michael Copley, SC, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, said Purcell's lawyers had not shown there had been any miscarriage of justice which would justify a new trial. He said a 12-year sentence was warranted when Purcell's previous criminal history of violence against women was taken into account with the fact there had been a trial in which the complainant had to give evidence. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/convicted-rapist-howard-william-purcell-seeks-retrial-over-his-police-interview/story-e6freoof-1225934385656 http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/woman-raped-in-new-farm-park-court-heard/story-e6freoof-1225795838256 Search

HUY QUACH (VIC- Box Hill)|36 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in the County Court in April 2009, to 8 yrs/3 mths jail - 5 yrs non parole.|Former Policeman. News- Herald Sun (9-12-2009)- "Rapist cop awaits sentence"- A RAPIST cop had sex with a mentally ill woman while claiming to check on her welfare, a court has been told. Huy Vinch Quach, a former policeman stationed at Box Hill, went to the woman's house with two other officers after police were called to check on her whereabouts on July 3, 2007. The three police officers found the woman sleeping on the couch and her house in disarray with alcohol bottles strewn on the floor. The County Court heard Quach, 35, returned to the woman's house at the end of his shift and the woman woke to find him sitting in her lounge room. Quach, who had a 12-year career in the force, gave her some groceries and offered to take her out for a coffee. She accepted, but he instead drove her to his flat where they had sex. Afterwards, Quach drove her home, handed her $50 and said, "It's not illegal, but don't tell anyone." After the woman confided to her case manager, the incident was reported to police. Quach denied having sex with the woman, but admitted visiting her because he said, "I just felt sorry for her." Prosecutor Ray Elston, SC, said the former policeman knew his victim was vulnerable and had used his position of power to take advantage of her. Yesterday the former senior constable pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office. He will be sentenced by Judge Meryl Sexton today. In April, Quach was jailed after a County Court jury found him guilty of raping a woman while she was sleeping in May 2004. He also pleaded guilty to five counts of possessing a drug of dependence and one of misconduct in public office after he admitted using and giving out cocaine and ecstasy to young women at nightclubs. Quach was sacked by Victoria Police in March this year. For all crimes, he was sentenced to eight years and three months in prison with a minimum of five http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/former-policeman-huy-quach-admits-to-using-role-for-sex/story-e6frf7jo-1225968353237

Quartermaine broke into the woman's home in Maddington and sexually assaulted her while her eight-year-old daughter slept beside her. He returned three weeks later and committed the same offences. Quartermaine originally pleaded not guilty to the offences, but changed his pleas after his victim testified in court. Today, District Court judge Richard Keen described the crimes as "every woman's worst nightmare", and said Quartermaine had shown no remorse for his crimes. He said Quartermaine had targeted the woman, who had been unable to escape from him because her daughter and her three other children would have been left alone in the house.

Stalked a 15 yr old girl. Registered sex offender/ Repeat Offender- Criminal history includes convictions for aggravated sexual assault, and indecent treatment of boys. News (14-5-2012)- "Paedophile likely to offend again"- AN IPSWICH paedophile will pose a real risk of reoffending once he is released from jail for stalking a teenage girl, Ipswich District Court heard. Gordon Anthony Allwood, 42, met a 15-year-old girl and her father in Gatton last January when they arrived to offer assistance to flood victims. Allwood spent four months stalking the teenager via indecent text messages, following her to work and watching her when she was out. Crown prosecutor Sarah Maleckas told the court the girl and her family were scared and distressed by Allwood's "grooming" behaviour. Allwood pleaded guilty to unlawful stalking in March and the case was adjourned until Friday for his defence to obtain a psychiatric report. The report declared Allwood refused to accept what he did was wrong. Judge Deborah Richards said Allwood still denied responsibility for his actions and did not understand the significance of his behaviour. She said Allwood would pose a real risk of further offending once released. Allwood was sentenced to two years jail. With time already spent in custody, he will be eligible to apply for parole on July 14. Allwood also pleaded guilty to failing to comply with his reporting obligations as a registered sex offender and was sentenced to six months prison, to be served concurrently with the two-year head sentence. In March the court heard Allwood told his victim he had an 18-year-old friend named David and pretended to be him in some of the texts. He also asked for naked photos of her and offered to send her naked photos of himself. Ms Maleckas noted Allwood had almost identical offences in his criminal history, which included convictions for aggravated sexual assault and indecent treatment of boys. http://www.qt.com.au/story/2012/05/14/pedophile-likely-to-offend-again/ http://www.qt.com.au/story/2012/03/31/childs-stalker-struck-at-flood-shelter/

Man exposed himself to girl, 12 (8-8-2012) A flasher with a history of exposing himself to young children in the Gympie and Fraser Coast areas has now shown his genitals to a 12-year-old girl at a Brisbane pool. Steven Paul Barney, 55, did not react as Brisbane District Court heard the string of indecent exposures to children, once to a family of seven children aged 11 to two. The father of 11 children, who grew up in Gympie and spent a large portion of his life on the Fraser Coast, also had history of behaving similarly in NSW and the Northern Territory. Crown prosecutor Sam Bain said Barney had once asked four young girls to have sex with him and to remove his underwear. He said the criminal history showed no previous sentences had deterred the man from exposing himself. Defence barrister Julian Noud said his client was clearly intoxicated when police arrived at the Sandgate pool to reports of indecent exposure in February this year. "He's been in the grip of an alcohol addiction for most of his life," he said. "He accepts this is and continues to be a problem." Mr Noud said Barney, who had white hair and a long white beard, was an Aboriginal man who felt disconnected from his land and his culture. He said he turned to alcohol whenever he had a breakdown. Judge Grant Britton sentenced Barney to the 174 days he has already spent in custody and ordered him to complete nine months of probation. http://www.qt.com.au/news/man-exposed-himself-girl-12/1497737/

TREVOR JAMES BENJAMIN (QLD- Cairns)|28 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 29-11-2011, in the Townsville District Court, to 11 yrs jail.|Trevor Benjamin/ The "Riverway Rapist" - pleaded guilty to rape. Stalked his victim, (a 19-year-old girl) for about 30 minutes before bashing and raping her on a jogging track near Vickers Bridge/ Townsville, in February 15, 2010. Repeat Offender - has a history of violent sexual offences against women. News- "Brutal rapist stalked victim on Riverway"- THE "Riverway Rapist" was caught after he had a bizarre conversation about the sex attack with a taxi driver and was the brunt of workmates' jokes because he resembled the sex attacker's comfit. Cairns paver Trevor James Benjamin, who has a history of violent sexual offences against women, was working at Lavarack Barracks when he randomly picked a 19-year-old Townsville girl to brutally attack sexually. Chilling details of the violent sex crime - on February 15, 2010 near Vickers Bridge - emerged at the 26-year-old's sentencing yesterday in the Townsville District Court. Crown prosecutor Michael Cowen, who said the girl's random rape was one of the most fearful and chilling crimes in the community, revealed the teenager asked, "Why me?", and Benjamin replied "Because you are the only one out here".http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2011/11/29/287091_news.html 'Riverway Rapist' may get sentence reduction..1-6-2012 THE "Riverway Rapist" may have his 11-year jail sentence reduced because his victim could not explain the "violent" injuries she received, as he had knocked her unconscious before sexually assaulting her. Trevor James Benjamin pleaded guilty in November last year to the 2010 rape - called "chilling" and "fearful" by prosecution - after he king-hit her as she jogged past. But the 28-year-old yesterday appealed for a reduced sentence of nine years, saying too much emphasis was placed on the girl's injuries. His defence lawyer Rob East told the Townsville Supreme Court the violent injuries could only be assumed. "The (victim) was not able to particularise any violence that occurred to her during and after the rape," Mr East said. "It was left to looking at photos and taking inference. "The photos showed more injuries than just being king-hit and inference was drawn (by Judge Stuart Durward SC) that they were gratuitous." Benjamin, a former paver from Cairns, stalked his victim for about 30 minutes before raping her on February 15, 2010. The girl was left bloodied, bruised and unconscious alongside the running track after the rape, and was found by another jogger. When the teen asked her attacker "why me?" he responded "because you're the only one out here". Mr East argued her injuries may have been rendered when she was knocked unconscious and fell, and said the rapist's sentence was "outside the appropriate range". Crown prosecutor David Jones argued otherwise, and said Judge Durward SC was correct in labelling the injuries gratuitous. "The photos show multiple blows and contusions which indicate the complainant was dealt with very roughly," he said. Court of Appeal president Justice Margaret McMurdo AC asked how the victim could give evidence if she had been knocked out. "It appears she drifted in and out of consciousness," Mr Jones said. Justices McMurdo AC, David North SC and Jim Henry reserved their decision on Benjamin's appeal. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2012/06/01/334635_news.html (30-11-2011)- "RIVERWAY Rapist" Trevor James Benjamin deserves his 11-year jail sentence and everything that happens to him as a result. The community is cheering loud and long after he was sentenced yesterday for stalking, bashing and raping a 19-year-old girl in February, 2010. This young girl, full of hopes and dreams and making her way in the world, went out for an evening jog and her life changed forever. It's hard to imagine the pain, terror and gut-wrenching disgust she must have felt as Trevor James Benjamin crept up behind her, punched her in the face and committed this awful crime. This case presents a number of grave concerns that everyone in society must consider. Firstly, what happened in Trevor James Benjamin's life to make him want to lurk in a public place searching for a victim to rape? At what point growing up at home and in his interactions with other people did he decide rape was an option? This wasn't some drunken escapade which went further than it should have, this man left his accommodation that fateful night with the intent of raping someone. It's a scary thought that people like this walk among us. Secondly, he was only caught by pure luck and smart police work because someone decided to tell police about a random, but odd, conversation. Some time after the attack, this grub decided to jump out of a cab without paying the fare and this is the sole reason police arrested him and set off the chain of events that led to the rape charge. As part of the police investigations, the cab driver told them Trevor James Benjamin was talking about the rape of a girl in Townsville and this raised the cops' suspicions. When you think Trevor James Benjamin's workmates were ribbing him about looking like a police comfit of the rapist, it's easy to see that everyone has a responsibility to fight crime. If you hear something or have the slightest suspicion - no matter how seemingly insignificant - tell the police, and gutless scum like Trevor James Benjamin will be caught and punished. Need for dedicated judge- THE calls for a dedicated Family Court judge to be based in Townsville are justified. Justice Robert Monteith is retiring from the court after 11 years of service but his replacement has not been named. There are fears the Federal Government will just fly a judge to town as needed but this is unacceptable. Townsville is the second-largest regional centre in Queensland and continues to grow at a rapid rate. If anywhere needs a fully functional Family Court, our city is surely it. Yet it looks like our southern political masters are shortchanging the North yet again. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2011/11/30/287451_opinion.html
MICHAEL JOHN BOEHMKE (QLD)|31 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced to 3 yrs jail - 12 months non parole. Placed on two years' probation. re-sentenced on appeal to 12 months' jail - suspended after serving about 8 months.|Michael Boehmke - Pleaded guilty in April 2011, to 5 counts of indecent treatment of a child under 16. Victim was a 15 yr old girl. Boehmke told the girl after indecently assaulting her that: "I swear to Christ if you tell anyone about this I'll come back and slit your throat." "Sentence cut for child sex offender after 'vigilante' attacks" (26-7-2011) A child sex offender has had his jail term cut after a court took into account the trauma he suffered from 'vigilante' attacks from his victim's family. Michael John Boehmke, 31, was to spend 12 months in jail after pleading guilty in April this year to five counts of indecent treatment of a 15-year-old girl in her own home. Boehmke is now free after that time was cut to about eight months by the Court of Appeal. Court of Appeal president Justice Margaret McMurdo said the young girl's family needed to understand Boehmke's time in jail would have been longer but for their retribution antics. The court heard Boehmke, 31, was bashed by the girl's brother who left him with facial injuries, a fractured rib and collapsed lung. He was hospitalised for four days and had health problems for weeks stemming from the assault. On another occasion, the girl's family made death threats against him and smashed his car window with a baseball bat. "The fact that an offender has suffered extra-curial punishment will not necessarily result in a significantly reduced sentence ... but nor can this court ignore the detriment the applicant suffered at the hands of the complainant's family acting as vigilantes," Justice McMurdo said in a judgment published today. "I emphasise that our community does not tolerate vigilantism. The complainant's family must understand that the applicant's sentence would have been longer but for their anti-social retributive behaviour," Justice McMurdo said. The court heard Boehmke, who was known to the girl's mother, had been staying the night at the girl's family home in October 2010. First, he inappropriately touched the girl on a couch. When others retired to bed, he entered her room and tried to kiss her despite her telling him to get out of her room. He left then returned a short time later and exposed himself to her and held her down while he performed oral sex on her. He told the girl: "I swear to Christ if you tell anyone about this I'll come back and slit your throat." The girl told her brother the next morning and he bashed Boehmke, accusing him of raping his sister. Boehmke told police he had mixed alcohol with prescribed drugs and could not remember the incident in the girl's room. In April this year he pleaded guilty to five counts of indecent treatment of a child under 16 and stealing $10 from her room. He was sentenced to three years' jail to serve 12 months before being eligible for parole. He was also placed on two years' probation. But he appealed, arguing the sentence was manifestly excessive. In a unanimous decision, Court of Appeal judges sentenced him to 12 months' jail suspended after he had served about eight months. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/sentence-cut-for-child-sex-offender-after-vigilante-attacks-20110726-1hy6y.html#ixzz1wvzUnkSV

WADE BENJAMIN BREARLEY (QLD- Brisbane)|yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 5 months jail in 2011.|Wade Benjamin Brearley- Convicted of possessing child pornography and "upskirting" a work colleage...Registered Queensland Nurse- In July 2012, the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal banned Brearley from re-registering as a nurse for 3 yrs. NURSE BANNED FOR CHILD PORN AND UPSKIRTING- (10-8-2012) A registered nurse has been banned from the profession for three years after being convicted of possessing child pornography in the worst category and upskirting a work colleague. Queensland nurse Wade Benjamin Brearley was jailed for five months last year after admitting to accessing child exploitation material, between August 2008 and October 2009, and taking photos up the skirt of a female colleague while on duty. Despite having been released on parole, the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal banned Brearly late last month from re-registering as a nurse for three years and ordered he undergo counselling by a clinical psychologist approved by the Nursing & Midwifery Board of Australia for at least 12 months. In her judgment, QCAT deputy president, Fleur Kingham, noted Brearley had taken steps to preserve the child exploitation material on portable memory devices over the 14-month period. "Some of the images were of the most serious categories, depicting penetration, sadism or bestiality," she said. "It is also concerning that Mr Brearley brought his sexual offending into the workplace. "The upskirting offence indicated a willingness to play a more active part than he had previously played in securing pornographic material." Ms Kingham said she was satisfied the tribunals sanctions on Brearley would ensure he was a minimal risk to his colleagues and the public in the future. "The purpose of the counselling is to facilitate Mr Brearley developing insight into why he engaged in the conduct the subject of these proceedings and to develop strategies to prevent the reoccurrence of such conduct," she said. If he does return to nursing Brearly will be barred from accessing any file, whether electronic or hard copy, of any client or patient under the age of 18, unless he is under the supervision of another registered nurse at the time. He will also be banned from using any form of computer with internet access at his workplace, unless under direct supervision. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/nurse-banned-for-child-porn-and-upskirting-20120810-23yio.html

Judge Bradley said if the men were to be sentenced for the current offences on their own they would have drawn lengthy terms of actual jail. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/pedophiles-given-suspended-sentences-in-20-year-case/story-e6freoof-1226261744373
BRYAN DESMOND BULL (QLD- Ipswich)|50 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 5 yrs jail - reduced to 3.5 yrs on appeal.|Bryan Bull- found guilty of Rape. Victim was a 12 yr old girl. News (2-4-2012)- "Rapist has sentence reduced"- AN IPSWICH man jailed for raping a 12-year-old Toowoomba girl after meeting her mother on a dating website has had his sentence reduced by 18 months. But Bryan Desmond Bull was unsuccessful in overturning his rape conviction when he appealed his case in the Queensland Court of Appeal. Bull was found guilty of rape after a trial in the Ipswich District Court last year, but was acquitted of two other offences. In challenging the verdict, he argued the conviction was unreasonable and inconsistent with the acquittals, the prosecutor misstated evidence in a critical respect and the judge did not direct the jury that a doubt entertained about the victim's evidence on one count was relevant to the overall assessment of her credibility. Bull also argued the sentence was manifestly excessive. Bull, who was 45 at the time, got to know the girl's mother through an internet dating service. They met for the first time on Good Friday, 2007. The woman drove from Toowoomba to Ipswich for the first date of a short-lived relationship that ended the following July. A Court of Appeal judgment detailed how the couple spent weekends together and the mother sometimes left her children with him, which is when the rape occurred. Justice Richard Chesterman said the trial judge had noted the serious emotional impact the offence had upon the girl and her mother. "He described the rape, correctly, as opportunistic and noted (Bull) had taken advantage of the child for his own sexual gratification," he said. "He had misused his position of the child's temporary guardian in the absence of her mother. "The offence occurred when (the girl) was ill and her mother was unable to care for her by reason of her work commitments. "Although there was no violence involved there was a degree of force. "(Bull) ignored and overwhelmed (the girl's) reluctance to take part in the activity and pushed her head onto his penis. "Discerning gradations in depravity is a difficult if not impossible task, as is determining a precise level of punishment for each grade. "The cases can be no more than indications of available ranges for roughly comparable offending. "The offending is rightly regarded as serious, but comparison with other like cases indicate that the sentence is excessive." Three Court of Appeal justices unanimously agreed to reduce Bull's sentence from five years to three-and-a-half. http://www.thechronicle.com.au/story/2012/04/02/rapist-has-sentence-reduced/
DALE MARTIN BURNS (QLD)|40 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Dale Martin Burns- Paedophile/ Repeat Offender. 34-point supervision order for pedophile- (8-4-2008) Queensland's chief justice has defended the judicial system's role in dealing with prisoners who fall under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. Chief Justice Paul de Jersey today said judges were often required to exercise "a sensitive, difficult and not infrequently controversial jurisdiction", and that recent criticism about the release of some prisoners has been unwarranted. The comments were made in a written judgment handed down today which ordered the release of a serial pedophile under a 34-point community-based supervision order. Dale Martin Burns, 36, has been serving a four-year jail sentence for indecent dealing with children under 16. The offences involved three male victims - aged between 13 and 14 - who he met in his role as a cricket coach. Between May 2002 and June 2003 Burns "groomed" the boys and encouraged them to participate in sexual activities, for which he would reward them with cigarettes. Burns had previously been convicted for other child sex offences, some of which were committed in 1989 when he was a trainee football coach. He is due for release later this month under the new supervision order. Under the order Burns is prohibited from coming into contact with children and from taking drugs. He must also undergo extensive rehabilitative therapy. In handing down the order, Chief Justice de Jersey defended his decision, saying all the evidence provided to him supported Burns's release. "It would be nothing short of capricious for a judge nevertheless to order continuing detention: that would amount to a surrender to passion or prejudice or other irrelevant considerations, and an abrogation of judicial responsibility," he said.

DAVIN ROY BUTLER (QLD- Rockhampton)|23 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 11-2-2011, in the Rockhampton District Court, to 8.5 yrs jail.|Davin Butler- found guilty of 2 counts of rape, 1 count attempted rape. Victim was a young Aboriginal woman. Co-offenders - Joshua Peter Marshall and Julian Marc Lawton . News (11-2-2011)- "Trio sentenced for gang rape"- THREE men found guilty of the pack rape of a young Aboriginal woman have each been sentenced in the Rockhampton District Court today to between seven and eight-and-a-half years in prison. Judge Grant Britton delivered his judgment after hearing submissions from Crown Prosecutor Joshua Phillips and defence lawyers yesterday. A jury took four hours to come to a verdict which found Joshua Peter Marshall, 20, Davin Roy Butler, 23, and Julian Marc Lawton, 25, each guilty of two counts of rape and one of attempted rape. During the trial the court heard that Butler and Marshall had sex with the woman without her consent at a park near the South Rockhampton Memorial Pool on December 14, 2007. Lawton was also guilty of rape because he aided and assisted the other two by his presence and also the violence he showed towards the complainant. Judge Britton sentenced Lawton to seven years in prison to reflect his lesser involvement while Marshall was sentenced to eight years and Butler eight-and-a-half years. EARLIER: THREE men have been found guilty of a brutal gang rape of a young Aboriginal woman in a Rockhampton park more than three years ago. A jury deliberated for more than four hours before finding Davin Roy Butler, 23, Joshua Peter Marshall, 20, and Julian Marc Lawton, 25, each guilty of two counts of rape and one off attempted rape yesterday afternoon. Family members of the convicted rapists wept in the public gallery after the verdicts were read out. Judge Grant Britton after hearing submissions from Crown Prosecutor Joshua Phillips and defence lawyers for the trio adjourned the court and will deliver his sentence this morning. Mr Phillips asked for a sentence of between eight and nine years for each man. During the trial the court heard that the men had sex with the woman without her consent at a park near the South Rockhampton Memorial Pool on December 14, 2007. Mr Phillips told the court Marshall and Butler had taken turns to rape her while Lawton was also responsible because of the words uttered and the violence he had displayed towards her. He told jurors the case stands and falls on their assessment of her credibility. In a statement the complainant said she was raped by Marshall while the other two men held her down and hit her repeatedly. She said Butler then attempted to orally rape her but she bit him on the penis. Butler then raped the woman while the other two held her down again. Ross Lo Monaco, appearing for Lawton, said because his client did not physically take part in the acts of rape his sentence should be significantly discounted. He finds himself in this mess because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He had also not taken advantage of the situation for his own sexual gratification. Jeff Clarke, who represented Marshall, said his client was just 17-years-old at the time of the incident. He was illiterate and educated to a grade eight level. He asked for a reduced penalty because of his young age at the time and lack of criminal history. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/story/2011/02/11/trio-guilty-of-gang-rape-butler-marshall-lawton/
CLIFFORD JOHN BYRNE (Clifford Byrne) (QLD- Walkervale)|50 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced May- 2012, in the Bundaberg Supreme Court, to 27 months jail - to be released after 9 months.. To serve 24 months on probation and a suspended sentence for 2 yrs after his release.|Clifford John Byrne- Pleaded guilty to 3 counts of using a carriage service to access child pornography, one count of using a carriage service to transmit child pornography, and possessing child pornography. Kid porn 'addict' had 3000 photos (16-5-2012) A self-described child porn addict and "boy lover" will spend the next nine months behind bars after admitting to possessing more than 3000 child porn images and 90 videos. Clifford John Byrne, 50, pleaded guilty in Bundaberg Supreme Court yesterday to three counts of using a carriage service to access child pornography, one count of using a carriage service to transmit child pornography, and possessing child pornography. Prosecutor Jessica Williams said police raided Byrne's Walkervale home in September 2010 and found 3246 child pornography images and 94 videos depicting child porn on a computer tower, external hard drive and 32 CDs. Ms Williams said the images had been downloaded between March 2005 and August 2010. The court was told the images contained pictures of children, mostly boys, aged between three and 15 - either naked or engaged in sex acts, including bondage-type activities. "(Byrne) describes himself as a 'boy lover'," Ms Williams said. "He said he does not want to do anything with them." Ms Williams said 64 images were sent onto other parties using the peer-to-peer file sharing facilities in Yahoo Messenger. The court heard of those 64 images, 13 were categorised in the two most exploitative categories. Byrne was convicted in 2006 of possessing about 11,000 child pornography images. Defence lawyer Jakub Lodziack said the defendant had been trying to seek help for his problem, but had difficulties finding a counsellor who would help. Mr Lodziack said Byrne had found one counsellor who was willing to help him, but he had to stop going because he could not afford to get to the appointments in Hervey Bay. "My client instructs that he has been diagnosed with depression and suffered from suicidal thoughts since being charged," he said. Mr Lodziack said Byrne claimed he had not viewed child porn since his latest arrest. Justice Duncan McMeekin sentenced Byrne to 27 months imprisonment, to be released after nine months. Justice McMeekin ordered Byrne serve 24 months on probation after being released. Byrne will also be subject to a suspended sentence for two years after his release. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/boy-lover-to-spend-9-months-in-prison/1381525/
CLIFFORD JOHN CANDY (QLD- Mt Coolum)|30 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 20-5-2011, in the Brisbane District Court, to 2 yrs and 6 months jail - suspended after serving 348 days. Time spent in pre sentence custody declared as time served.|Clifford Candy. Indecent treatment of a child under 12 yrs/ Sentenced May 2011. Update - Man faces flash charge (1-11-2011) Serial flasher tells court he exposed himself to overcome fears of being naked in public (21-6-2012) A SERIAL flasher who has exposed himself in public 19 times over a decade tried to convince a judge he only does it to overcome his fear of being seen naked. Clifford John Candy, 30, told the Brisbane District Court he liked to wave his genitals around "like a flag" - mainly in front of children - in front of people to fight his fear of going nude in public - and feed his adrenalin addiction The comments raised the ire of Judge Milton Griffin, SC, who described the claim as "absolutely absurd." Candy yesterday pleaded guilty to indecent treatment of a seven-year-old girl by exposing himself to her as she played in the sand on Marcoola beach, 100km north of Brisbane, about 10am on October 30 last year. The court was told Candy fled when confronted by the girl's mother, but committed another indecent act when he moved into sand dunes, stripped naked and bared his manhood to "all and sundry" on a heavily populated stretch of beach. Judge Griffin put Candy in the witness box to give evidence under oath after dismissing the accused man's claims of receiving no sexual gratification from the acts as ludicrous. "It seems to me absolutely absurd," he said. "Any member of the community would think what you were doing was not right." Mr Candy testified: "I was waving it about ... like a flag." He said his predilection for serial exhibitionism was triggered by his blinding fear of being seen naked in public. "I became addicted to chasing down that fear (of being seen naked)." "I confronted my fear. It's an adrenalin rush." "I used to ... do it behind womens' backs, but I'd dare myself to allow them to see me (naked)." Prosecutor Amelia Loode said Candy had 17 previous convictions, before yesterday, for exposing himself in public, including to young children at a video store, a shopping centre and using a flashlight to direct one child to look at him in the dark while standing in his garage. She said in 2001 Candy was convicted of exposing himself to motorists as he stood alongside of the Sunshine Motorway on-ramp. Mr Candy denied claims he was masturbating on the day, saying he was playing a peek-a-boo style of game in which he would cover his nether regions, then expose himself as cars drew near. The court was told Candy had breached a suspended bail and term and probation order as a result of his latest offences. Barrister Martin Van der Walt, for Candy, said his client claims to derive no sexual pleasure from his behaviour and feels deep shame after each act. Judge Griffin told Mr Van der Walt to take clearer instructions from his client before considering whether to call further evidence by way of a contented sentencing hearing. "Why is he doing it to children?" he said. "I have no doubt in my mind this (case) requires a custodial sentence." The hearing continues. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/serial-flasher-tells-court-he-exposed-himself-to-overcome-fears-of-being-naked-in-public/story-e6freoof-1226403798961 Man faces flash charge (1-11-2011) A YOUNG man accused of masturbating in front of a woman and her child on a Coast beach was remanded in custody yesterday.

Coombes, 31, is serving life in jail after he pleaded guilty in April 2010 to the murder of greyhound trainer Leo John Coutts. Coombes shot Mr Coutts, 72, in the head with a sawn-off rifle during a botched robbery in the elderly man's recently-purchased Caboolture home, in October 2007. He was also charged with five counts of rape in an unrelated series of events, also in Caboolture, in October 2007. Coombes was alleged to have orally raped a woman four times and had sexual intercourse against her will another time. It was alleged Coombes was upset with the woman because her former defacto partner owed him $5000 from a drug deal and he could not find the man. In the Supreme Court in Brisbane in March last year, Coombes pleaded not guilty but was convicted on four counts and found not guilty on another. He appealed on the grounds the verdicts were inconsistent and unsafe. In an unanimous judgment the Court of Appeal today dismissed the appeal.

CHRISTOPHER FRANCIS COSTELLO (QLD- Brisbane, Wishart)|49 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in July 2010, in the Brisbane District Court, to 27 months jail. To be released in September 2011.|Christopher Costello/ Found guilty in the Brisbane District Court in July last year, 2010, on 4 counts of using the Internet to expose a child under 16 to indecent material, and 1 of using a carriage service to groom a child under 16. Internet sex groomer's appeal dismissed (11-3-2011) A Brisbane entertainment manager who was jailed after an online undercover police operation caught him trying to sexually groom a child in a chat room has lost an appeal against his conviction. Christopher Francis Costello, 49, of Wishart, was found guilty in the Brisbane District Court in July last year on four counts of using the Internet to expose a child under 16 to indecent material and one of using a carriage service to groom a child under 16. He was sentenced to 27 months' imprisonment, with Judge David Reid ordering he be released in September this year. During the sentencing hearing, the court was told Costello spent 13 hours in early 2009 sending messages, pornographic images, and videos of himself masturbating to what he believed was a 14-year-old girl named "Cassie". The self-employed marketing manager was unaware that he was, in fact, speaking to an undercover male police officer posing as the girl. On one occasion he phoned "Cassie" only to speak to another undercover police officer who was posing as the girl's father. Costello took his case to the Court of Appeal in Brisbane in February, where his lawyers argued the conviction was unsound because evidence was improperly led during the trial. His counsel also argued there were major flaws in the prosecutor's closing address and that Judge Reid failed to properly direct the jury about the use of circumstantial evidence. In a written judgment handed down today, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, ruling the directions and summing up were satisfactory. The court also ruled that on the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to find Costello guilty. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/internet-sex-groomers-appeal-dismissed/story-e6freuyi-1226019741759

The former Rockhampton Regional Council project manager's addiction intensified. Cox had downloaded more than 60,000 child pornography photos on his computer. Some of those were adults having intercourse with babies, a court heard yesterday. The 38-year-old pleaded guilty in the Rockhampton District Court to two counts of using a carriage service to access child pornography and two counts of possessing child exploitation material. Judge Leanne Clare sentenced Cox to five years in prison after police found explicit material on four monitors and a computer tower at his Gracemere home. Cox had his "sophisticated" technology system linked to a child pornography network. Crown prosecutor Peter O'Connor said Cox had categorised all the images and videos stored on his computer into five levels based on how explicit they were. Category five, described by Mr O'Connor, as containing the most graphic and gruesome images, contained photos of bestiality and sexual acts between children. Police searched Mr Cox's Gracemere home in January 2011 and found the "elaborate" network system, which contained more than 7500 child exploitation images and 918 "category five" videos. He was charged and released on bail. Ten months after raiding Cox's home, police obtained another search warrant and seized Cox's computer after finding more child pornography material. Defence lawyer Tom Polley told the court his client developed an "interest" in child pornography after the material "ended up on his computer". He had been engaging in online child exploitation material for the past 10 years, the court heard. Mr Polley said however that Cox only downloaded the material for his own viewing and didn't share the material. Judge Clare said Cox was a respectable man in the community and had a good upbringing. "No doubt your arrests and the knowledge of what you have done has been a heavy burden," Judge Clare said. He will be released on parole on July 29, 2013. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/jail-for-kid-porn-addict/1646402/

"Terror for victim as Gold Coast sex attacker Ryan Cross goes free" (19-5-2013) The victim of a sex attack on the Gold Coast's Millionaires Row is living in fear after the predator walked free with a suspended sentence. The woman, 26, was one of several attacked while walking or jogging on upmarket Hedges Ave at Mermaid Beach in December last year. She managed to fight off her attacker and police used DNA from under her fingernails to catch 21-year-old Ryan Cross. Cross appeared in Beenleigh Magistrates Court this month and pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault. He was sentenced to 12 months' jail, suspended immediately for two years. The penalty has angered the woman and her partner. "A 12-month suspended sentence is a joke," the victim's boyfriend said. "I don't understand how someone can have their DNA on a police database, plead guilty to sexual assault and still be out among the community. "She has suffered months of nightmares and trauma already from this attack, and now there is no justice whatsoever. We just want some semblance of justice, by people being aware of what a creep this guy is." The man said his girlfriend's name had been given to Cross as part of the DNA identification process. "With him still free and knowing her name, she's more worried than ever," he said. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/terror-for-victim-as-gold-coast-sex-attacker-ryan-cross-goes-free/story-e6freoof-1226645954779 http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/two-women-sexually-assaulted-on-hedges-ave-mermaid-beach-gold-coasts-millionaires-row/story-e6freoof-1226541833797

Victim was a 3 yr old girl. . "Child sex offender craig anthony ellis disrupts sentence hearing for second time" (5-9-2011) A man who broke into a family home on Brisbane's northside and sexually assaulted a sleeping three-year-old girl is facing further charges for allegedly threatening to kill the child's mother during his sentence hearing. Craig Anthony Ellis was again removed from his sentence hearing in the District Court in Brisbane on Monday after repeatedly hurling abuse at prosecutor Vicki Loury. It was the second time Judge Michael Rackemann has had Ellis taken from the courtroom after he was thrown out of the first day of his hearing last month. As he was being led away on that occasion Ellis abused the girl's mother who was sitting in the public gallery and allegedly threatened to kill her. Judge Rackemann further adjourned the hearing today to get a pre-sentence report compiled on Ellis because of Ellis's repeated outbursts in court. The sentence will now be completed on November 7. However, Judge Rackemann said he wanted to raise a matter arising out of Ellis's behaviour on the first day of the hearing. He said the statements made by Ellis to the child's mother appeared to him to be a direct threat and he would refer a transcript of what was said to the Director of Public Prosecutions for possible criminal charges. Ellis has repeatedly tried to change the guilty plea he entered after three days of a District Court trial last September. He has also sacked several sets of lawyers and maintained it was illegal to sentence him. At the start of the trial, Ellis,32, pleaded not guilty to burglary and rape charges but changed his plea to guilty to burglary and two counts of indecent treatment of a child under 12-years-old, on January 21, 2009. Ellis has repeatedly disrupted his two sentence hearings by claiming to be innocent, abusing Ms Loury and Judge Rackemann and claiming he was in effect framed. As Ms Loury began to read the facts of the case to the court today Ellis repeatedly interjected saying: "No, I didn't." Judge Rackemann warned Ellis several times to allow Ms Loury "to do her job" before having him removed from the courtroom. Ms Loury detailed how at about 2am Ellis broke into the family's Aspley home on Brisbane's northside and went to the little girl's bedroom. He removed items of her clothing before taking photographs of her. Ms Loury said the child woke up and cried out with her parents arriving to find a naked Ellis trying to leave. The girl's father tackled Ellis and held him until police arrived. Ms Loury said during the struggle Ellis had removed the memory card from his camera and hidden it under a carpet where police later located it. She said Ellis told police he was out looking for bats when he heard a noise at the house and went to investigate. Ms Loury said the incident had turned into a nightmare for the family who had waited two years and seven months for Ellis to be sentenced. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/child-sex-offender-craig-anthony-ellis-disrupts-sentence-hearing-for-second-time/story-e6freoof-1226129623630

"Violent rapist jailed" (23-8-2011) A man who uses violence to achieve his desires was jailed yesterday for nine years for rape and robbery. Craig Fisher, 30, pleaded guilty to violently raping a 42-year-old woman he met at the Glasshouse Mountains railway station in February, 2009. The woman, who was repeatedly punched and dragged by her hair to nearby shops, was raped orally and vaginally. Fisher also bashed a 66-year-old man, who was watching Hogans Heroes at a Murgon hotel, to steal his wallet in December, 2009. Crown prosecutor David Nardone said Fisher had been released from jail on parole just 10 days before the rape. He said Fisher committed the robbery shortly after his release later the same year. It appears that nothing deters him, Mr Nardone said. Violence appears to be a way of life for Mr Fisher and the community deserves protection from him. Barrister Steve Courtney said his client had been drinking heavily and had run out of cigarettes. He said his client went looking for dumpers  smoked cigarettes butts that can be recycled  when he came across his rape victim. Mr Courtney said the incident unfolded after the victim refused to give him a Tally-Ho paper. He said his client targeted the robbery victim after the man, who knew Fishers family and tried to be friendly, called him a coon. The court heard Fisher pleaded guilty at the eleventh hour after he accepted a conglomerate of images from the railway station Judge John Robertson said those images seriously undermine your protestations of innocence. Judge Robertson described prolonged violence where Fisher humiliated and frightened his victim into succumbing to his desires. Judge Robertson said Fishers behaviour was that of a man who did not hesitate to use violence against others to get what he wanted. He said the assault had a profound effect on the woman, who suffered significant facial injuries. She was virtually a stranger to you, as was the victim of the robbery, Judge Robertson said. Fisher has already served 182 declarable days in custody. He can apply for parole from February, 2015. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2011/08/23/violent-rapist-jailed-attacks-strangers-coast/

Released from jail in September 2012, under a strict supervision order..|Philip Arthur Gilchrist- Repeat Offender- Broke into a womans unit,held a knife to her throat before raping her.. The woman then attacked him, forcing him to fall out of a window and on to her car parked below.. 2 previous convictions for attacks on women. News (26-9-2012)- "Wheelchair-bound rapist Philip Arthur Gilchrist granted supervised release from jail" A WHEELCHAIR-bound sex predator who is a "serious danger to the community" and whose "future risk of sexual reoffence is high" has been granted supervised release from jail. Convicted serial rapist Philip Arthur Gilchrist, 51, was last week granted release from jail and allowed to live in the community by a Brisbane Supreme Court judge the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. Gilchrist has a long history of sexual offending but his final attack made headlines in 1997 for two reasons. Firstly, his victim successfully sought permission from the then Attorney-General Matt Foley to speak publicly to the media as part of her healing process. Secondly, it was revealed Gilchrist had been injured when his victim attacked him with a dumb bell forcing him to fall several floors from an open window. In November 1997, Gilchrist was sentenced to 13 years jail for the attack on the woman in her near-city unit. Gilchrist had randomly selected the woman's home and scaled a drainpipe to enter her third-level unit through the bathroom window. He held a knife to her throat before raping her. The woman then turned the tables on Gilchrist, attacking him and forcing him to fall out of a window and on to her car parked below. Gilchrist had two previous convictions for attacks on women - one for raping a woman in a toilet block and raping another woman after scaling a pipe and breaking into her unit. Justice Martin Daubney, in a written decision handed down on Friday, said expert medical evidence to the court demonstrated Gilchrist remained a serious danger to the community. However, he said the same experts also concluded Gilchrist could be managed appropriately if he was released under a "strict supervision order." The court was told one medical expert also questioned Gilchrist's need for a wheelchair, saying the alleged "atrophy of the legs" had been used in jail to "shirk work." "I ... record, lest there be any doubt, that the evidence before me is acceptable, cogent evidence which persuades me to a high degree of probability ... to justify me making a decision that (Gilchrist) represents a serious danger to the community," Justice Daubney said. "Doctors (who testified also) ultimately concluded, in the evidence before me that (Gilchrist) could be managed appropriately under a strict supervision order." Gilchrist will be forced to obey 34 conditions as part of the order, including that he submit to a curfew and electronic monitoring. http://www.news.com.au/national/wheelchair-bound-rapist-philip-arthur-gilchrist-granted-supervised-release-from-jail/story-fndo4ckr-1226481688808

Pedophile faces life on next offence, judge warns- (9-8-2012) A BRISBANE judge has warned a convicted pedophile he faces the very real risk of receiving a mandatory life sentence the next time he commits a child sex offence, no matter how minor. Father-of-four Paul Kenneth Greer, 31, was jailed for twelve months, to be released on parole after two months in custody, on Thursday after pleading guilty in the Brisbane District Court to possessing child pornography over a six week period last year. The court was told in 2005 Greer, then aged 25, was convicted of a number of sex offences relating to a 15-year-old girl he took in as a boarder and then sexually assaulted. Prosecutor Mathew Thompson said Greer's "relationship'' with that child was exposed when the teenager went to police and revealed the illegal sexual affair and that fact she was pregnant. He said Greer was convicted, without a conviction being recorded, by a Beenleigh magistrate on charges of unlawful carnal knowledge, attempted unlawful carnal knowledge and indecent treatment of a child under 16. The court was told in June last year Greer was taken into custody on unrelated matters and that police found 127 images of child exploitation material on his iPhone. Judge David Reid, in sentencing Greer, pointed out to the accused man he had now racked up his second strike and that his next similar offence would result in him serving a minimum 20 years behind bars. "(Greer's) criminal history is very worrying ... (and this) is a serious offence,'' Judge Reid said. "It's particularly serious and he (Greer) should understand that ... (with a third strike offence) I'm talking about 20 years jail.'' Judge Reid was referring to tough new laws passed through Parliament last month. The laws require any person convicted of their third child sex offence receive a mandatory life sentence with a minimum non-parole period of 20 years. A two-strikes policy will only apply to serious sex offenders who have previously been convicted of a sex crime that's punishable by life imprisonment, such as rape. Barrister Jim Veivers, for Greer, told Judge Reid: "That's not enough to scare him (Fien) your honour, nothing will.'' Greer is scheduled to be released on parole on October 8. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/pedophile-faces-life-on-next-offence-judge-warns/story-e6freoof-1226446762143

JASON PAUL HANNON (QLD- Brisbane)|41 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 16-9-2012, in the District Court in Brisbane, to 18 months jail - suspended after serving 3 months jail.|Jason Paul Hannon- Pleaded guilty to 2 Commonwealth charges of accessing child pronography, and a state charge of possessing child pornography. Man jailed for child porn offences- (16-9-2011) A JUDGE found he had no choice but to jail a man on child pornography charges despite there being many mitigating factors in the case, a court heard today. It was the latest in a string of District Court cases where judges ruled that because child pornography was not a "victimless crime" it tipped the sacles to an actual jail term for defendants. In the District Court in Brisbane Judge Tony Rafter, SC, sentenced Jason Paul Hannon to 18 months jail, to be suspended after three months. Hannon, 40, had pleaded guilty to two Commonwealth charges of accessing child pronography and a state charge of possessing child pornography. Judge Rafter said between September,1 and October 1, 2007, Hannon had paid $US79 to access a child pornography site. He said between August and November 2008 Hannon had visited 10 child pornography websites. When police raided Hannon's house in December 2008 they found 3548 images on his computer and 14 videos all depicting child pornography. Judge Rafter said while 95 per cent of the images were in the least serious category, there had been some in the more serious classifications including young children having sex with adults. He said Hannon was forced to wait more than two years to get a sentence hearing until a separate High Court leave application, about how to charge child pornography cases, was resolved. Judge Rafter said Hannon had a good work history, no previous convictions for similar offences, had overcome difficulties in his life, and had indicated early that he would plead guilty. "But these offences are not victimless and I have concluded the only appropriate sentence is one in which you serve some actual time in custody," he said. http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/man-jailed-for-child-porn-offences/story-fn6ck51p-1226138847913
SEAN STEPHEN HATTEN (QLD)|29 yrs old (2012)|Serving an indefinite jail term, 2012.|Sean Hatten. Has convictions for the rape of a 12-year-old girl, and assaults on schoolgirls. Also pleaded guilty to attempted murder- (stabbed a stranger 13 times). Hatten became the youngest Queenslander handed an indefinite prison term. News (1-5-2012)- "Convict Sean Stephen Hatten blamed 'bad day' as reason for slashing man's throat, court hears"- A PSYCHOPATH who became the youngest Queenslander handed an indefinite prison term was back in court for slashing a fellow prisoner's throat because he was having a bad day, a court has been told. The Brisbane District Court was told Sean Stephen Hatten, then 28, slashed the inmate with a prison-issue razor while he waited to brew a beverage at the Capricornia Correctional Centre, 20km north of Rockhampton, on April 13 last year. The court was told Hatten, after the "calculated and premeditated" attack, told prison guards he slashed and punched the man because he was having a "dip" - his word for having a bad day. Prosecutor David Finch said Hatten told prison guards: "I slit his throat and punched him because I was having a dip." When asked what a "dip" was, Hatten said: "Having a bad day." The prosecution has asked Hatten be handed a further nominal 15-year jail term - based on the fact he is already serving an indefinite term. In December 2008, The Courier-Mail revealed Hatten was sentenced to an indefinite jail term for the second time because a judge believed he was still a great risk of killing or causing serious harm. Brisbane Supreme Court Justice John Byrne made the assessment while resentencing Hatten for a vicious attack in which he stabbed a stranger 13 times for no apparent reason. Justice Byrne ordered Hatten serve an indefinite sentence with a nominal sentence of 15 years. He said Hatten had scored a "high level of psychopathy" on an indication scale and psychopathy was untreatable. Justice Byrne noted Hatten had difficulty controlling his rage and aggressive behaviour, even in the controlled environment of a prison. He said the picture painted by expert witnesses was of a man at great risk of killing or causing serious harm were an indefinite sentence not imposed. "Supervision under parole has no realistic prospect of reducing the grave danger that Hatten would kill," Justice Byrne said. In 2005, Hatten, then 22, became the youngest person detained indefinitely under a Queensland law to deter violent crime. Hatten pleaded guilty to attempting to murder Louise Hendriksen, 44, at the Seven Hills Reserve, on Brisbane's southside, in September 2003. The court was told Hatten came across Hendriksen, a stranger, and stabbed her 13 times with a penknife for no apparent reason. He had other convictions for the rape of a 12-year-old girl and assaults on schoolgirls. However, in February 2007, the Court of Appeal sent Hatten's case back to the Supreme Court. Problems arose because Hatten had been sentenced prior to a High Court judgment that states a defendant has to be considered a danger past the end of his nominal sentence to be sentenced indefinitely. Judge Kiernan Dorney, QC, sentenced Hatten to 13 years jail. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/convict-sean-stephen-hatten-blamed-bad-day-as-reason-for-slashing-mans-throat-court-hears/story-e6freon6-1226343511612 News (7-2-2007)- "Violent rapist fights ruling"- THE youngest person in Queensland to be serving an indefinite jail term could have his sentence quashed because of a new legal point. Problems arose because Sean Stephen Hatten was sentenced before the High Court delivered a judgment in a separate case of the Darling Downs Rapist, Jason Buckley, which now dictates the steps for an indefinite sentence. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/violent-rapist-fights-ruling/story-e6freoof-1111112957553|/images/sean_hatten_2.jpg

News (22-3-2012)- "Sentence cut for rapist with knife"- A SERIAL prostitute basher may have won an early release from prison after it was deemed his nine-year jail sentence was "manifestly excessive". During a spate of attacks on prostitutes, Michael James Hill held a knife to a Mooloolaba call girl and raped her. The Court of Appeal has ordered Hill be eligible for release from jail on parole this month, more than 18 months before his original parole eligibility date of December 24, 2013. Judges found the original sentence was too severe for Hill's crimes. The 32-year-old arranged to meet the Mooloolaba prostitute in a motel room on June 22, 2009. Once inside the room, he grabbed the woman and held a knife to her throat. He told her that if she did what he said she wouldn't get hurt and proceeded to indecently touch the prostitute and force her to give him oral sex. She told Hill she had AIDS in an attempt to prevent him forcing her into unprotected oral sex, but it did not stop him. During the attack, the prostitute asked why he was doing this to which Hill replied: "Because I hate all you women." He repeatedly told the prostitute "girls are sluts" and said he was "sick of you girls ripping me off". Hill said he would not pay for a prostitute again. Back in his hometown of Gladstone, Hill attacked two more prostitutes less than a month later. The Court of Appeal reduced his original jail sentence of nine years to five years. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2012/03/22/sentence-cut-for-rapist-with-knife/ http://www.gladstoneobserver.com.au/story/2012/03/22/early-release-for-prostitute-basher-jail-sentence-/

Pervert gets prison sentence- (5-2-2011) CONVICTED pervert Andrew David Humphries had moved in with a family and shared a room with a 13-year-old disabled boy in breach of orders that he have no contact with children under 16, Toowoomba Magistrates Court heard yesterday. Andrew Humphries, 41, had been a reportable offender under the Child Protection Act since his conviction in September last year for possessing child pornography in the form of mobile phone photographs of childrens genitalia depicted in medical books, the court heard. One of a number of restrictions imposed by the court was that Humphries was to have no contact with children under 16 unless under approved supervision, or reside in a house where children under 16 live, or loiter or remain within 200 metres of a school or day-care centre. In December police had been told Humphries had moved into a Rockville home with a family and was sharing a room with a 13-year-old disabled boy. When questioned by police he admitted he had moved into the home for about a week-and-a-half and said he had helped undress the boy for showering as the lad was severely handicapped, prosecutor Sergeant Mark McKenzie told the court. Humphries also admitted he had sexual thoughts about children, but told police he had never touched the child inappropriately, Sgt McKenzie said. Humphries said he had moved into the family home because the only accommodation he had been able to find had been within 200 metres of a school or day-care centre which would be in breach of his five-year order. Humphries pleaded guilty to contravening an offender prohibition order and giving false or misleading information. He also pleaded guilty to an unrelated public nuisance offence arising from his standing naked outside public toilets at the University of Southern Queensland on the afternoon of September 26. Magistrate Bruce Schemioneck sentenced Humphries to 12 months jail, minus the 58 days he had spent in pre-sentence custody, and ordered he be eligible to apply for release on parole from April 8 http://www.thechronicle.com.au/story/2011/02/05/pervert-cops-prison-sentence-toowoomba-andrew/

Man posed as nurse to rape teen (11-3-2011) DAVID Irelandes fraudulently claimed to be a nurse and he unlawfully carried out intimate internal examinations on a heavily pregnant 17-year-old girl in the week before she gave birth. The teenager, who still suffers emotional harm, later described how she felt violated, was sick and gutted when she learnt that Irelandes was a fraud. Posing as a nurse allowed Irelandes to win the trust of the teenager, her boyfriend and family members. He did not commit the offences for sexual gratification because he is openly homosexual and it remains a mystery why he did it. It (internal examinations) caused the girl a lot of pain and the threat of injury to her and her unborn child was very real, Crown prosecutor Chris Winlaw said. The Crown says he got some gratification from being closely involved in her pregnancy and his desire to deliver the baby. "His conduct was reckless, dangerous and selfish and he did it at great risk to the girl and her unborn child. Irelandes, 21, right, pleaded guilty in the District Court in Mackay yesterday to six offences of rape in November 2009.

Rapist given 10 year sentence- (7-6-2012) A convicted rapist has been sentenced to 10 years jail after being found guilty of a number of charges against two women in Warner Street, Port Douglas. Sentencing was handed down to Joseph Jack of Hope Vale at the Cairns District Court yesterday. Jack was 20 when he violently attacked the women who were walking alone in the early hours of November 8 and November 18, 2010. "He went to trial last week and he was found guilty of all charges," said Detective Sergeant and Officer In Charge at Mossman CIB, Trevor. These charges were Common Assault for which he was given an 18 month sentence, Assault Occasioning Bodily Harm (2 years 6 months), Rape (10 years), and stealing from the person (6 months). These terms are to be served concurrently and no minimum sentence was handed down. "It was really good to get him off the streets," Detective Sergeant Perham said. "He escalated his violence from the first attack to the second. "He was in his infancy in committing these offences but he very quickly escalated his degree of violence." Detective Sergeant Perham said Jack preyed on women walking alone after leaving local night spots, and urged others to take heed of the warnings. "I can't warn people strongly enough about not doing stuff like that. It's a safe place, but we're not immune," he said. http://www.tourismportdouglas.com.au/Rapist-given-10-year-sentence.7738.0.html

Army recruit spat on girl after filming rape- (22-6-2009) A Brisbane army recruit filmed himself raping a 16-year-old girl and later spat on her while she lay unconscious on a bathroom floor, a court has heard. Brisbane man Timothy Alexander Jack, 21, will spend the next six months behind bars after he pleaded guilty today in the Brisbane District Court to one charge of rape and one charge of sexual assault. The court was told Jack, then 19, was at a house party on New Year's Eve 2006 when he asked a 16-year-old for sex and she refused, telling him she "wasn't like that." Some time later she passed out after drinking ten to 12 tequila shots and while she was unconscious, Jack raped her while using a mobile phone to film the act. Later the girl woke up and he helped her while she vomited in the toilet. She passed out again on the bathroom floor and another person filmed Jack spitting on her body. Days later the girl found out through friends what Jack had done and heard that he had been "laughing about it" with friends whom he showed the footage. She then made a complaint to police, who questioned him about the incident and found the footage on his phone. Defence barrister Paul Smith said his client had had a relationship with his victim in the past but said his behaviour at the party was out of character. He said at the time of the offence, Jack, a former student of St Laurence's Catholic College in Brisbane, had began training with the Australian Army. He had hoped to serve Australia in Afghanistan but could not do so as he was on leave awaiting sentencing, Mr Smith said. Judge Leanne Clare SC said Jack had taken advantage of the girl. "You filmed yourself violating her body," she told him. "You used her for your sexual pleasure, you treated her with contempt." She sentenced him to two years' jail, to be suspended after he serves six months. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/army-recruit-spat-on-girl-after-filming-rape-court-20090622-ct6l.html#ixzz24RVVSHOr

It took the jury less than a day to return the guilty verdict.

Judge Robertson said the court had heard that two of the videos showed children crying and resisting, while a third involved a bondage scenario. He said the children involved in the videos were aged between 7 and 15. "These are truly appalling activities, which seem to be on the increase," he said. The judge said it had not been disputed that the videos were described as category four child pornography material, on a scale of one to five with five as the worst. Judge Robertson said Jay had shown a lack of remorse when he instructed his barrister to put to his step-daughter the scenario that she had downloaded the videos in order to frame him - a claim the judge said he thought lacked evidence. In sentencing, he said he took into account Jay's previously unblemished record and the fact he would no longer be able to work with children. Defence barrister John McInnes said Jay had suffered public humiliation after media reports of the court case. "Because of his position as a school bus driver, he had a number of people call asking if he was the person involved," he said. Mr McInnes said Jay had also lost his job as a school bus driver. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/man-36-sent-to-jail-for-child-porn-videos/1100658/

Appealed his sentence, and was released after serving less than 2 mths jail.|Ricky Carl Jones/ Former Ipswich football coach- pleaded guilty to using a carriage service to download child exploitation material and 2 counts of possessing child exploitation material. .Much of the material was in category four  the second-worst category  and depicted children as young as 6 yrs old. News (4-6-2011)- "Courts release shamed coach" An Ipswich football coach jailed for possessing child pornography has been released after successfully appealing his sentence. Ricky Carl Jones was ordered to spend three months out of a 15 month sentence behind bars after admitting downloading child pornography. But he was released yesterday after spending less than two months in jail. Police found 44 images and seven videos of child exploitation material in Jones Barellan Point home. Much of the material was in category four  the second-worst category  and depicted children as young as six in sexual acts. On April 8 Ipswich District Court Judge Gregory Koppenol sentenced Jones to 15 months jail, to be released after three months on a $2000 good behaviour bond, for using a carriage service to download the material. He also received a 12-month concurrent jail sentence for two offences of possessing child exploitation material. Jones, 47, pleaded guilty to all three charges. But his lawyers appealed the sentence, arguing Jones had suffered public shaming by appearing in The Queensland Times newspaper over his offences and should not spend any time in jail. Commonwealth prosecutors agreed a 15-month jail sentence with immediate release was appropriate. Defence barrister Steve Kissick said he could not object to media coverage of the case but public shaming was a relevant consideration. Because of my clients position at the time  a coach in local football  he did receive significant shaming, Mr Kissick said. But Judge Koppenol argued the media had a right to report on the case. Theres nothing wrong with that in my opinion, Judge Koppenol said at the time. The media has a right and should be encouraged. Judge Koppenol said courts should take a tough stand against people who accessed and possessed child pornography as it was not a victimless crime. Mr Kissick applied for Supreme Court bail for his client shortly after the sentence but it was refused and Jones remained in jail pending the result yesterday. The Supreme Court of Appeal increased Jones sentence to two years for using a carriage service but ordered he be released from jail immediately. The 12 month sentence was not changed on appeal. The court heard Jones had turned to the internet and pornography when his second marriage broke down and he was depressed. After being charged in 2009 Jones was stood down from the Norths Rugby League Club, where he had coached adult players as well as juniors since 1994. http://www.qt.com.au/news/courts-release-shamed-coach-sentence-increased-but/868708/ http://www.qt.com.au/news/footy-coach-child-porn-trial/538571/ http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/footy-coach-faces-child-porn-charge-20090814-ek5f.html|/images/ricky_carl_jones_2.jpg

MARK KENNEDY (QLD)| |Sentenced in the Brisbane District Court, to 22 yrs in jail.|Rapist. News (25-9-2006)- "Rapist at work in community"- A SERIAL rapist and a pedophile are among four sex offenders allowed back into the community on work release at least seven times despite a ban imposed in June. The ban has since been reinforced by prison chief Frank Rockett after The Courier-Mail photographed Palen Creek prisoners  including Mark Kennedy, a serial rapist serving 22 years  working at the Beaudesert Showgrounds on August 28. In sentencing Kennedy, District Court Judge Tony Healy said the attacks had featured "revolting cruelty and violence". He is among the prisoners doing community service at showgrounds, church yards and memorial grounds in the Beaudesert and Boonah areas  often near schools. Prison guards say only one officer supervises as many as five inmates over large, open areas, often at distances of more than 500m and out of sight for up to 10 minutes. The prisoners on work leave-of-absences (LOAs) are considered low-security and are serving sentences for rape, armed robbery, sodomy, murder, traffic offences and assault. In June a three-year program in which sex offenders were among a group of inmates doing ground maintenance at the Star Gardens Nursing Home at Beaudesert ended because of officers' concerns about inadequate supervision. "Many of the residents at Star Gardens lay in their beds unsupervised quite visible from the outside with only a screen door as a divide," an officer wrote in April. The officer also raised concerns that sex offenders on work release at a Rathdowney church were close to a primary school. "I am unsure if everyone approving these LOAs knows of its proximity to Rathdowney school and wonder if they did would it be approved?" he wrote. In June, Palen Creek management reduced the number of inmates sent to the home to three and Mr Rockett issued a directive that no sex offenders be allowed work release. But documents show nothing was changed in relation to sex offenders working at churches, showgrounds and memorial grounds at Beaudesert, Rathdowney and Boonah. When The Courier-Mail asked Corrective Services whether sex offenders were still working at showgrounds and near schools, the department denied it. A spokesman said community service projects were conducted under strict guidelines and supervision. Queensland Prison Officers Association state secretary Brian Newman said members believed the LOAs arrangements and "dangerous" staffing levels were putting public safety at risk. "One unarmed prison officer cannot effectively monitor the movements of sex offenders or any prisoner on an external escort, this is especially alarming where it concerns the safety of our children innocently enjoying a day at school," he said. Mr Newman said if a prison officer went on a toilet break there "instantly" was a situation where prisoners were left unsupervised. "This situation regularly occurs and is being managed through good luck rather than good governance," he said. Officers said while there had been no offences committed by sex offenders or other inmates on the LOAs, it was important that "temptation was not put in their way". "It doesn't matter that these prisoners are low-security, they have committed very serious crimes and no one can predict what a guy who has been serving 19 years for rape is going to do if a woman or an elderly patient is around," an officer said. The Opposition called for an investigation into the allegations saying there was a "culture of cover-ups" permeating through the state's public service to protect the Government. Opposition Leader Jeff Seeney said it was important for the rehabilitation of sex offenders that they be allowed out on work release, but only after a risk assessment and under supervision. Other sex offenders in the program are: Thomas Richard Tiltman, 39 (who is serving 17 years for sodomy); Anthony John Davis, 45 (14 years for indecent dealing) and Shane Patrick Trunks, 36 (16 years for rape and attempted murder). http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/rapist-at-work-in-community/story-e6freoof-1111112260854

SAMUEL KRIS (QLD- Sarina)|27 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Paedophile. Convicted of a child sex offence in Queensland. News (7-2-2011)- "Sex offender didn't supply new address"- SARINA resident Samuel Kris is a registered child sex offender who failed to notify police of a change of residential address. Kris, 27, pleaded guilty in the Mackay Magistrates Court on Friday to failing to report under his obligations as a registered offender under the Australian National Child (Sex) Offender Register, known as ANCOR. He was convicted of a child sex offence in Queensland and has been on the register since May, 2008, and he has to remain on the register for 15 years, police prosecutor Elizabeth Cassells said. Among the many conditions of being on the register is a requirement to notify police of any change of residential address if he changes address for more than 14 days at a time. On November 11 last year police became aware that Kris had not been living at his registered address for more than 14 days. Detectives from the Child Protection Investigation Unit located him at an address in Penfold Street and he told them he had been living there for 16 days, Ms Cassells said. After being told by detectives that he would be charged, he moved out of the Penfold Street address back into his old address, Ms Cassells said. Kris had a previous conviction for a similar offence in February 2009, so this was his second breach in two-and-a-half years, Ms Cassells said. Acting magistrate Ron Muirhead said it was important that registered sex offenders comply with the conditions imposed on them by ANCOR. If you come back for a third offence, a prison sentence is likely, Mr Muirhead said. Mr Muirhead fined Kris $900 http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2011/02/07/sex-offender-didnt-notify-of-new-address/

Kynuna breached those conditions in July/ 2011 and was returned to jail..Dec/ 2011 Kynuna is jailed indefinitely.|Gregory David Kynuna - SERIAL sex offender/ Paedophile- Offences have included the rape of a 6 yr old Cairns boy in 2004. "Sex offender to stay behind bars" (8-12-2011) A serial sex offender who raped a six-year-old local boy and assaulted a group of girls while they were in Cairns on a school excursion has been jailed indefinitely. Yarrabah man Gregory David Kynuna has been in and out of jail for sexual assaults since 1987, when he broke into a Cairns hostel and inappropriately touched a number of girls who were staying there while on a school excursion. The 47-year-old was sentenced to six years jail in 2004 for luring a six-year-old boy away from his Cairns home and raping him. His sentence was extended after he indecently assaulted a female tutor in the jail, but he was released in July this year on strict conditions. Kynuna breached those conditions by the end of the month when he failed to keep to his curfew and he tested positive for cannabis. In a Supreme Court of Queensland decision published on Monday, Attorney-General Paul Lucas was successful in keeping Kynuna behind bars indefinitely. Psychiatrists had noted Kynunas risk of reoffending was "very high" if he did not adhere to curfews and maintain a drug-free lifestyle. " in my view, it is currently impossible to describe his potential for reoffending, either violently or sexually, as less than very high," one doctor reported. "In my opinion, it would be prudent at this time for Mr Kynuna to remain a resident of an institution, either in prison or preferably a maximum-security psychiatric hospital, and for the situation to be reviewed when he has been so resident of a period of 12 months." http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2011/12/08/195441_local-news.html http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/rapist-released-despite-sexual-assault-on-female-jail-tutor/story-e6freoof-1226083912155

Victim was a young Aboriginal woman. Co-offenders - Joshua Peter Marshall and Davin Roy Butler.

Judge Grant Britton delivered his judgment after hearing submissions from Crown Prosecutor Joshua Phillips and defence lawyers yesterday. A jury took four hours to come to a verdict which found Joshua Peter Marshall, 20, Davin Roy Butler, 23, and Julian Marc Lawton, 25, each guilty of two counts of rape and one of attempted rape. During the trial the court heard that Butler and Marshall had sex with the woman without her consent at a park near the South Rockhampton Memorial Pool on December 14, 2007. Lawton was also guilty of rape because he aided and assisted the other two by his presence and also the violence he showed towards the complainant. Judge Britton sentenced Lawton to seven years in prison to reflect his lesser involvement while Marshall was sentenced to eight years and Butler eight-and-a-half years. EARLIER: THREE men have been found guilty of a brutal gang rape of a young Aboriginal woman in a Rockhampton park more than three years ago. A jury deliberated for more than four hours before finding Davin Roy Butler, 23, Joshua Peter Marshall, 20, and Julian Marc Lawton, 25, each guilty of two counts of rape and one off attempted rape yesterday afternoon.

Judge Grant Britton after hearing submissions from Crown Prosecutor Joshua Phillips and defence lawyers for the trio adjourned the court and will deliver his sentence this morning. Mr Phillips asked for a sentence of between eight and nine years for each man. During the trial the court heard that the men had sex with the woman without her consent at a park near the South Rockhampton Memorial Pool on December 14, 2007. Mr Phillips told the court Marshall and Butler had taken turns to rape her while Lawton was also responsible because of the words uttered and the violence he had displayed towards her. He told jurors the case stands and falls on their assessment of her credibility. In a statement the complainant said she was raped by Marshall while the other two men held her down and hit her repeatedly. She said Butler then attempted to orally rape her but she bit him on the penis. Butler then raped the woman while the other two held her down again. Ross Lo Monaco, appearing for Lawton, said because his client did not physically take part in the acts of rape his sentence should be significantly discounted. He finds himself in this mess because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He had also not taken advantage of the situation for his own sexual gratification. Jeff Clarke, who represented Marshall, said his client was just 17-years-old at the time of the incident. He was illiterate and educated to a grade eight level. He asked for a reduced penalty because of his young age at the time and lack of criminal history. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/story/2011/02/11/trio-guilty-of-gang-rape-butler-marshall-lawton/|/images/julian_marc_lawton_2.jpg

"While (that) case was of a different nature, the volume of images of Millan's exceeds that case,'' he said. Millan's solicitor, Jeff Clarke, said his client had felt remorse and guilt. Magistrate Annette Hennessy said a community- based order was not sufficient. "The 75 games saved to disc are permanently stored and highly transportable,'' she said. "Imprisonment needs to be served.'' Millan's home was raided in September after police were told a technician repairing one of his computers had found the images. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/apn-teacher-gets-six-months-for-child/69016/

Prior conviction November- 2002, in Innisfail, for indecent treatment of a child..Jailed for 12 months, which was later reduced to six months on appeal "Raid nets child porn collection" (7-9-2012) Breaking News: Child porn offender Edwin Moffat, 64, was this morning sentenced to 18 months jail to be released after three months. He had pleaded guilty in the District Court in Mackay to using the internet to access child pornography. Moffatt was caught with 1640 child pornography files on his computer at his Mackay home in an Australian Federal Police raid. They also found copies of images on a memory stick at Moranbah, where Moffatt worked. EARLIER: Edwin Moffatt had 1640 files of child pornography on his computer when Australian Federal Police raided his Mackay house. Officers then went to Moranbah, where Moffatt worked, and found copies of the images on a memory stick. The 64-year-old admitted that he had been collecting the images for several years. He pleaded guilty in the District Court in Mackay yesterday to using the internet to access child pornography. Moffatt had a previous conviction in November, 2002, in Innisfail, for indecent treatment of a child, Commonwealth Crown prosecutor Amy Knott said. He was jailed for 12 months, which was later reduced to six months on appeal, she said. Moffat was arrested in Mackay in September last year after AFP received a tip off from Interpol. Of the 1640 files in his possession, 10 were videos. Ms Knott said the possession of child pornography was not a victimless crime as it exploited children somewhere in the world. "The children involved in these files can not protect themselves," she said. Defence barrister Greg Walsh, for Moffatt, said Moffatt was sexually abused as a child, and since his arrest he has been undertaking rehabilitation with experts in the field. "He accepts unreservedly that people like him, who access vile pornography, are contributing to the exploitation of children," Mr Walsh said. The Crown asked for a sentence of 18 to 24 months. The defence said the sentence should be about 15 months, with release after serving one-third of the sentence. Judge Julie Dick, SC, adjourned sentencing until today and granted Moffatt overnight bail. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/raid-nets-child-porn-collection/1534750/|/images/edwin_moffatt_2.jpg
HADLEY GRAHAM MOONEY (QLD - Rockhampton)|30 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced Feb 2011, in the Rockhampton Magistrates Court, to 6 months jail - eligible for parole 29-4-2011.|Hadley Graham Mooney - Pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual assault. Sexually assaulted his tutor while in custody at the Capricorn Correctional Facility. http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2011/02/22/extra-jail-term-for-assault-on-tutor/ "Prisoner assaults his tutor" (22-2-2011) Just 10 days shy of being released from jail, Hadley Graham Mooney sexually assaulted a female tutor who was helping him with a computer at Capricornia Correctional Centre. Mooney plead guilty to the charge of sexual assault and the brazen attack cost him at least an extra two months in jail. The 29-year-old man was jailed in September last year for his involvement in a violent home invasion that saw the occupant lose his eye. The Rockhampton Magistrates Court heard on Friday that while in custody at the Capricorn Correctional Facility, Mooney had sexually assaulted his tutor. Mooney was taking part in a computer class on February 3 with two other prisoners when the tutor was assisting him. Police Prosecutor Karen Dunham said the tutor reported that she had been standing by Mooney and had noticed his hand move to his groin area but assumed he had simply been scratching himself. She said he then reached out and grabbed her with a full hand on the vagina area. The tutor then stepped back and said dont do that Hadley and he let go. The court heard she then left the classroom and walked up the hallway with Mooney following her. She said she heard Mooney saying something about his computer password and asking what was wrong but she continued walking until she reached a secure area. She then told security who called Rockhampton Police. Defence solicitor Shayne Studdert said Mooney had said he had gotten the wrong impression from the tutor and when she said to back off he did. Mr Studdert said Mooney was due to be paroled on February 28. Magistrate Cameron Press sentenced Mooney to six months imprisonment with a parole eligibility date of April 29. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/story/2011/02/22/prisoner-assaults-his-tutor-capricornia/
DAVID WARREN MOORE (QLD - Brisbane)|58 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in November 2010, in the Brisbane District Court, to 15 mths jail - Sentence wholly suspended.|David Warren Moore - Pleaded guilty in November 2010 to 1 count of possessing child exploitation material. Moore has previous offences for sodomy and indecent behaviour and was jailed for 2.5 yrs in 1987. "Former cop avoids jail time for child porn" -(3-11-2010) A former Queensland policeman who featured in a TV show for kids has avoided jail for keeping child pornography at his workplace. David Warren Moore, 55, pleaded guilty in the Brisbane District Court on Tuesday to one count of possessing child exploitation material. On Wednesday, he was handed a wholly suspended 15-month sentence. Moore, who was known as "Constable Dave" in the 1980s when he appeared alongside the puppet Agro on the children's TV show Wombat, was caught with the vintage film when police went to his Brisbane workplace in May last year. The court was told Moore directed the officers to a box of porn he had stored in his office, telling them it contained a video that had child exploitation material on it. The tape contained about 13 minutes of video showing naked boys rock climbing and boating, with the focus on their genitals. Moore, who has previous offences for sodomy and indecent behaviour, told officers he was given the tape about 10 years earlier and had forgotten he had it. Moore sobbed in court on Wednesday as details of his public fall from grace were recounted. http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-national/former-cop-avoids-jail-time-for-child-porn-20101103-17d7d.html "'Proper scrutiny'" (Nov - 2010) Queensland Attorney-General Cameron Dick says he has no concern about the media coverage of the case. He says reporters are entitled to do their job. "Every Queenslander is entitled to go into an open Queensland court and see justice being delivered, and so too can the media," he said. "The media can report on any case in any Queensland court. "I have no concerns about the coverage of this case - it's important in a democracy that our courts receive proper scrutiny and i have no concern about the coverage of this case." Deputy Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg says no-one should be tried by the media, but the main issue is the sentencing. "There is always a public interest particularly in cases like this, and I suppose there is an argument that sometimes that can go a little bit too far," he said. "Having said that I think the principal consideration for any sentencing judge has to be 'does the punishment fit the crime and is the community going to be protected by the sentence?'" http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-11-03/former-policeman-sentenced-over-child-porn-charge/2322016
PETER ANDREW MORGAN (QLD - Townsville)|42 yrs old (2010)|Sentenced Dec 2010, in the Townsville District Court, to a 9 months jail - sentence wholly suspended.|Peter Andrew Morgan - Was charged with 2 state counts of possessing child exploitation material.. charged as part of Taskforce Argos a Queensland Police investigation targeting the illegal accessing and downloading of child pornography "Men walk free over child porn charges" (11-12-2010) A Townsville man who distributed a graphic tutorial over the internet describing how to sexually abuse young children will walk free in just three months after being sentenced yesterday. Timothy Hinspeter, 36, pleaded guilty to one count of distributing and three counts of possessing child exploitation material. On November 18, 2007, police discovered Hinspeter was circulating an explicit pictorial tutorial via a peer-to-peer file sharing site. The four-minute guide detailed how to sexually assault girls from infancy through to 13 years of age. Explicit instructions about different objects that could be used while performing illegal acts were provided. It also specified ideal times to carry out such offences to ensure a spouse would not discover what was going on. The file displayed 39 images of young girls. Hinspeter was arrested on March 5, 2008, after a raid at his home. In addition to the tutorial, police seized his laptop and numerous hard drives, which contained 42 child porn videos, some as long as 45 minutes. They depicted as many as three young children being molested by men. In handing down his sentence, Judge John Baulch SC told Hinspeter: "There is no indication the nature of the offence shocked you or caused you to reconsider or stop what you were doing." Hinspeter was given 18 months' jail for the distribution charge, to be wholly suspended after just three months. He will then be subject to two years' probation. Meanwhile, two other Townsville men also charged as part of Taskforce Argos a Queensland Police investigation targeting the illegal accessing and downloading of child pornography have pleaded guilty and walked from court. Ashley Kenneth Kearns, 48, and Peter Andrew Morgan, 42, both appeared this week in the Townsville District Court. Judge John Baulch SC said the pair, who were regular visitors to pornographic websites that offer illicit images and videos of underage children, was involved in a "disgusting trade". Kearns, an ex-employee of Ergon Energy, faced 22 charges. He also appeared on 21 commonwealth charges of using a carriage service, namely the internet, to download child pornography material. He was given two wholly suspended sentences 18 months in jail for the Commonwealth offences and ordered to pay $2000 recognisance, while he was given six months' imprisonment for the state charge. Peter Morgan, a fitter and turner, was charged with two state counts of possessing child exploitation material . He was given a nine-month jail sentence wholly suspended. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/12/11/191771_news.html
ALAN FRANCIS MORTIMER (QLD - Ipswich)|62 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 2 yrs jail.|Alan Francis Mortimer - sexually abused a 9 yr old girl. "Dad pays for pedophile threat" (19-3-2011) An Ipswich man who confronted a convicted pedophile over allegations of child abuse will spend the next nine months behind bars  while another pedophile caught grooming a boy of 11 is to serve just six months. The two men faced Ipswich District Court in separate hearings as controversy raged over two other sentences passed down by magistrates this week. The sentences which allowed two men who dragged a pony behind their car and a flood-looter who stole an elderly womans jewellery to avoid jail time prompted a furious reaction from Queensland Times readers. In the latest case, a 43-year-old stepfather went to the caravan home of pedophile Alan Francis Mortimer with two other men who are yet to face trial. The defendant, who cannot be named to protect his stepdaughters identity, was incensed when the seven-year-old girl claimed Mortimer had exposed himself to her inside his caravan. Unknown to the stepfather, Mortimer was on bail after being accused of sexually abusing a nine-year-old girl. He was later convicted of that crime and is now serving a two-year jail sentence. The stepfather waited outside Mortimers caravan in February last year while the other men went inside, armed with a bat, and brought him outside. They forced Mortimer, 61, into a car and drove him to where the girl was waiting with her mother. When the girl identified him, Mortimer claimed he was assaulted by the stepfathers accomplices, leaving him with a sore right hamstring. The stepfather was convicted of entering a dwelling while armed and in company and deprivation of liberty, but cleared of assault. Judge Gregory Koppenol sentenced him to 18 months jail to be released on parole on December 17, saying it was important to send a strong deterrence to would-be vigilantes. Crown prosecutor Sarah Dennis said: It was not the defendants job on that day to act as judge, jury and executioner. The Queensland Times understands Mortimer has not been charged over allegations he indecently dealt with the mans stepdaughter. He claimed it was simply a misunderstanding. While the protective stepfather will spend nine months in jail, a convicted sex offender who was caught with more than 10,000 child exploitation images after he tried to groom a young boy received a lighter sentence. Anthonie Roberto Hellemons, 45, yesterday pleaded guilty to two charges of indecent treatment of a child aged under-12 and one of possessing child abuse material. In December 2002, Hellemons invited the 11-year-old Ipswich boy to his house. He sat him on his lap, touched his stomach and stroked his hair while showing him an email which contained photos of nude adults. He then showed the boy a pornographic film. The child complained to his mother, who went to police. Police searched Hellemons home and discovered 10,543 child porn images on his computer and 1119 child abuse movies. Crown prosecutor Clayton Wallis said Hellemons was grooming the child. The court heard Hellemons was convicted in 1997 of sodomising an 11-year-old boy and sexually abusing him with a glass tube and gas bottle and sentenced to five years in jail. Judge Sarah Bradley sentenced Hellemons to 18 months in jail, to be suspended after he serves six months. Hellemons was charged before penalties for child sex offences were increased and the maximum sentence at the time was two years. Defence barrister Steve Kissick said his client believed he should spend no time in jail as he had stayed out of trouble for several years. http://www.qt.com.au/story/2011/03/19/dad-pays-for-pedophile-threat-ipswich/

Nallajar was sentenced in 2012 after attempted to rape an 11 yr old girl in May 2011..Pleading guilty to indecent treatment of a child under 12, unlawful deprivation of liberty and enter premises with intent. "Underage sex called 'cultural'" (28-7-2012) A MAN who says it's "become a cultural thing" on Palm Island to sleep with underage girls has been jailed for five years, after he attempted to rape an 11-year-old. His comments have enraged Palm Island elders and Indigenous spokespeople, who have called his remarks "appalling". Edward Nallajar, 37, lured his young victim to a laundry room with cannabis and $50 in May 2011, and tried to pull his shorts down and hers too. He was interrupted by the girl's brave friends, who pushed open the door where she was being held and pulled her out. A psychologist said Nallajar showed little remorse when he was interviewed afterwards. Nallajar told her most children on Palm Island weren't virgins and said, had he offered more money, the girl may have been more willing. He said having sex with children on Palm Island was a "cultural thing". But Professor Gracelyn Smallwood, a prominent Indigenous activist, said this was definitely not the case. "I've spoken to a number of key elders on Palm Island and they're disgusted at him saying it's culturally appropriate," she said. "It's absolutely appalling he used that in the courts. Under Aboriginal law, before white fellas came, you were actually speared or killed (for a crime like this)." Professor Smallwood has long campaigned against violence and rape, especially in Indigenous communities, and said it was a concern others might adopt the same excuse. She said prison sentences for offenders like Nallajar needed to be reviewed. "He has to have some serious mental health counselling," she said. "It should be compulsory, not elective, for every person in jail to take healing classes for their crime. There needs to be some serious accountability in terms of the institutions." Judge Stuart Durward SC had adjourned the matter for two weeks to decide whether Nallajar's intention was to rape the girl that day. He concluded yesterday in Townsville District Court that it was. "I'm satisfied that your intention in taking the girl to the laundry was to sexually interfere with her," he said. "It was only the brave intervention of the other children that prevented you from giving effect to that intention." Judge Durward SC declared Nallajar a serious violent offender, meaning he will have to serve at least 80 per cent of his five-year sentence. He has served 220 days pre-sentence custody and will be released after four years. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2012/07/28/350481_news.html Friends rescued girl from rape, court told- (12-7-2012) A YOUNG girl was saved from a convicted rapist by her heroic friends, who pushed open the blocked door where she was being held and pulled her out. The 11-year-old girl and her friends were playing marbles in the yard of a Palm Island home when they were approached by the offender in May 2011. The man, Edward George Nallajar, had been released from prison that week for raping an eight-year-old girl, and asked the children if an adult was home. He then lured the children to the home's laundry with a $50 note and cannabis. He grabbed the girl and closed the door to the small room with them inside, locking the others out. Her friends pushed on the door as the 37-year-old tried to pull the girl's shorts down and his own, while the terrified girl cried out for help. Prosecutor for the Crown Susan Hedge told a Townsville District Court one of the children got through and pulled the defendant away. "It was only due to the bravery of the other children that the complainant (wasn't raped)," she said. "The defendant said to the psychologist he would have had sex with the (child) if he wasn't interrupted." Nallajar's previous rape conviction against the eight-year-old girl was in very similar circumstances, including luring the girl with cannabis to some nearby school grounds, where he had committed sexual assaults. He had also been convicted of manslaughter when he was 18 years old and was jailed for six years. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2012/07/12/346111_news.html

ROY ANTHONY NEUMANN (QLD- Gympie)|48 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced May 2012, in the Ipswich Magistrates Court, to 6 months jail - granted immediate parole.|Roy Neumann - 2 counts of committing an indecent act in public. News (21-5-2012)- A SEX pest caught in the act of publicly pleasuring himself in his vehicle twice in a month has avoided jail time. Roy Anthony Neumann was charged with committing an indecent act in public after a passer-by spotted him engaged in an act of masturbation, within view of the skate bowl in Warwick's Queens Park on March 6. Police alleged at the time that Neumann was watching a video on his mobile phone while performing the act on himself. He was charged with a second such count on March 21, when police officers located him inside his vehicle while it was parked on Horsman Rd, in the vicinity of the Glennie Heights SS. Neumann, 48, had his case transferred from Warwick to the Ipswich Magistrates Court where he was convicted on both counts of indecency on April 24. A spokesman for the Warwick Police Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB) said public self-pleasuring was an offence under the Queensland Criminal Code. "In the first instance, this person was located by a member of the public at approximately 2.20pm on the day in question inside his vehicle, which was parked near the skate bowl," the spokesman said. "He was seated in the driver's seat of the vehicle with his underwear lowered and engaged in the act. "On the second occasion police were called to Horsman Rd where his vehicle had been observed and Neumann was arrested for the same offence." The Horsman Rd incident prompted calls to the Daily News as well as to police on the day, from concerned parents who had been walking their children home from Glennie Heights State School and who had seen Neumann openly masturbating inside his car. One mother claimed at the time that Neumann's vehicle had been observed on Horsman Rd on previous occasions at school finishing times. Neumann was sentenced in the Ipswich Magistrates Court to six months imprisonment, but was granted immediate parole. http://www.gympietimes.com.au/story/2012/05/21/caught-in-the-act-in-public-twice-masturbation/

July 2011- in Townsville Magistrates Court was fined $300 and conviction recorded after pleaded guilty to failing to comply with reporting conditions,as was required under child protection legislation.|Gary Anthony O'Brien - Child sex offender. Sex offender fined for failing to tell of baby- (26-7-2011) A CHILD sex offender who failed to tell police he was living with a newborn baby in his home was fined in Townsville Magistrates Court yesterday. Gary Anthony O'Brien yesterday pleaded guilty to failing to comply with reporting in December last year, as was required under child protection legislation. Police prosecutor Helen Armitage told the court O'Brien was living in Kirwan with his brother and his brother's partner, who was pregnant. Under child protection laws, O'Brien was required to alert authorities to any changes involving children living in his home, which he failed to do when his nephew was born. Ms Armitage said when approached by police, O'Brien told them he had alerted his parole officer but did not tell Child Protection and Investigation Unit officers, as required. O'Brien told police he did not think he had to tell officers because he had already told his parole officer. He also told police he only thought the rule only applied to his own children, but later admitted to police he did not report when he should have. Defence lawyer Peter Saggers said his client was released from prison on parole in October in 2008 and moved to Kirwan in May 2009. He said O'Brien's brother and partner then moved into his house in May last year. "She was pregnant and there were spot checks throughout the time as there is with corrective services," he said. "It was obvious she was pregnant. "She was heavily pregnant by the time they saw her last time. "He thought he discharged his responsibility earlier because he'd told his parole officer." Mr Saggers said O'Brien mentioned it again to his parole officer after the baby was born, but did not mention it to police during an annual review later because he did not think he had to. The lawyer said his client did not intentionally break the parole conditions and requested he be released absolutely without punishment. However, Magistrate Peter Smid said it was "too serious an offence" not to hand out any punishment at all, despite believing there was no dishonesty involved. He fined O'Brien $300 and recorded a conviction. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2011/07/26/251531_news.html

Prior history for child sex offences 1977 (Brisbane) and 1997 (Rockhampton). "Church pedophile 'tore family apart'" (18-3-2010) An elderly Bundaberg woman has told how a compulsive pedophile preyed on her four children through church and wrecked their lives forever. The woman came forward after reading about the sentencing of William Hugh Phillips, 72, on five counts of indecent treatment with aggravation, earlier this month. Phillips had pleaded guilty in Bundaberg District Court to the charges, relating to a Bundaberg boy, and was jailed for three-and-a-half years. The court heard he had two prior child sex convictions  in Brisbane in 1977 and in Rockhampton in 1997.

In 2007, Matthew Andrew Riseley, 22, killed Isaac Lazarus, the child of a woman that Riseley was living with at the time. The boy suffered multiple fractures and bruising consistent with being bashed and violently shaken. In May this year, Riseley was sentenced in the Supreme Court to eight years in jail and declared a serious violent offender. The Attorney-General appealed against the sentence, arguing anything less than 10 years was inadequate. But the Court of Appeal today said it was hard to justify a sentence more severe than penalties imposed in previous cases. The Court removed the serious violent offender declaration and fixed Riseley's parole eligibility date to 2011. But the Queensland Opposition says community expectations have not been met with the sentence reduction. Deputy Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg says tougher sentencing laws are needed. "I don't necessarily blame the courts - I blame the Government for actually laying down very weak sentencing laws in Queensland and not providing the guidance necessary for the courts when it comes to sentencing tragic cases like this," he said. "It's not all that difficult to do and it doesn't mean that you're going in and interfering with the business of the courts in the court room. "All it simply means is that the Parliament reflects the community's concerns about what is acceptable and what isn't acceptable in sentencing." Acting Premier Paul Lucas says he is shocked by a court's decision to reduce the sentence. Mr Lucas says the decision was unexpected given the violent nature of the crime. "I am very shocked by this decision - I've spoken to the Attorney-General about it," he said. "Clearly we need to understand what went wrong here - whether there needs to be further changes to the law to deal with this matter. "But we need to understand this the courts are independent of government." http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-09-22/baby-killers-sentence-cut/1437588 Matthew Riseley jailed for shaking baby (26-5-2009) A FATHER-OF-FOUR killed his girlfriend's newborn son by shaking him so hard it caused his brain to haemorrhage, a court has been told. Matthew Andrew Riseley, 22, was today jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of 19-day-old Isaac James Lazarus on November 10, 2007. Prosecutor Vicki Loury told the Supreme Court in Brisbane Riseley had caused the baby a "constellation of injuries'' when he squeezed his chest and shook him repeatedly. She said Isaac suffered haemorrhaging in his brain, retinas and optic nerves, severe bruising on his neck, and one of his ribs had been cracked. The baby also had a fractured leg caused by his limbs flailing while being shaken. The court was told Isaac also had two skull fractures which were consistent with being hit with severe force. Ms Loury said Riseley had attacked the baby while the mother lay sleeping in the next room at her home in Loganlea, south of Brisbane. When the mother woke the next morning she noticed Isaac was pale and gasping for air. He was taken to hospital but died of a severe brain injury later that day. The court was told Riseley repeatedly changed his story about what had occurred, saying he had dropped Isaac on a concrete floor or that he had fallen with him into a cabinet. He eventually admitted to police that he had squeezed him out of frustration and sleep deprivation. The court was told there was no evidence Isaac had been crying excessively at the time of the attack. Isaac's family filled the courtroom to hear the fate of his attacker, and sobbed as details of his injuries were read out. Justice Margaret Wilson said it was a "brutal assault on a helpless baby'', and declared it a serious violent offence. Riseley, from Logan, must now serve 80 per cent of his sentence before being eligible for parole. He has already served 560 days in pre-sentence custody. http://www.news.com.au/national/matthew-riseley-jailed-for-shaking-baby/story-e6frfkvr-1225716462561#ixzz1xY9X2JZN

Nigel Robinson served nine years in jail for raping a 19-year-old woman at knifepoint after he stalked her from a Gympie shopping centre and then indecently assaulted a nine-year-old girl he approached in a Gympie schoolyard -Below. "Porn concerns over sex offenders release" (7-8-2013) A dangerous Gympie sex offender will be released next week despite a psychiatrist fearing he is on a "slippery slope" to living out violent sexual fantasies. Nigel Patrick Robinson accessed pornography, including rape images, on the internet while living at the Wacol Precinct, against rules restricting him from doing so. Robinson served nine years in jail for raping a 19-year-old woman at knifepoint after he stalked her from a Gympie shopping centre and then indecently assaulted a nine-year-old girl he approached in a Gympie schoolyard. He was kept in custody past his full-time release date in 2006 because authorities deemed his Gympie home "unsuitable" due to its close proximity to the school. But he was released in 2009 to the Wacol Precinct on a supervision order made under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. Crown prosecutor Jonathan Horton, acting for the Attorney-General, told Brisbane Supreme Court that Robinson had accessed violent images, contravening multiple conditions. Justice George Fryberg found Robinson had breached the rules of the precinct in accessing the internet and had contacted a woman believed to have an intellectual impairment without telling authorities but Justice Fryberg did not find the violent pornography condition breached. Robinson told the justice he "got caught up in the use of the internet" and contravening his supervision order did not cross his mind. He said he was recklessly clicking on a range of websites. "I didn't look intentionally for violent pornographic material," he said. "This is the hardest I've done in jail ... because I broke a promise to two people (his mother and partner). .

In Brisbane District Court, Richard Lawrence Robinson, 35, of Cunnamulla, in southwest Queensland, was declared a serious violent offender, meaning he will have to serve at least 80 per cent of the sentence. Earlier this month, a jury found Robinson guilty of nine offences  six counts of rape and one each of deprivation of liberty, burglary and stealing. Judge Michael Shanahan said the attack was worsened because Robinson, who has hepatitis C, wasnt wearing protection when he raped the terrified woman. You knew you suffered from hepatitis, Judge Shanahan said. the court had been told that early on February 28, 2005, Robinson broke into the womans Caboolture townhouse. The woman, who was asleep in her lounge room, woke to find her shirtless attacker in the room. Robinson threw a cloth over her face before raping her and forcing her to perform sex acts on him. He then asked if he could come back later and have sex with her again. Robinson forced her upstairs and raped her again in a bedroom before making her shower. He left but promised he would return. The court was not told if the woman contracted hepatitis C. Judge Shanahan said Robinson had an appalling criminal history and was sentenced in 1989 to 12 years in prison for rape and five years for burglary. It is clear these penalties havent persuaded you not to reoffend, Judge Shanahan said.  http://www.observationdeck.org/weblogs/vault/?page_id=42

Colin Ryrie - convicted of eight child sex charges and given a maximum sentence of eight years - can rejoin his killer brother for Christmas. The Adult Parole Board has granted the sex attacker early release on November 21, instead of in 2011, defying pleas from his family and victim advocates to keep him locked up. The pedophile's former wife, said members of her family were fleeing to a safe address. She said she feared Ryrie would make good his death threats against her. "It's disgusting he's been released. I'm scared to death because once he gets out he won't stop," Ms McCoy said. She said Ryrie hated getting older and had threatened to kill himself and members of his now estranged family. "He's going to come after me and kill me," she said. "I know this monster and he's sat in jail for five years and it will be stewing in his head," she said. "What he did was so horrific."

PETER SAMUEL (QLD- Maroochydore)|42 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 9-5-2012, in the Vic County Court, to 10.5 yrs jail - 7.5 yrs non parole.|Found guilty by a County Court jury of 5 counts of rape and committing an indecent act with a person under 16. Peter Samuel who was caught by DNA testing, viciously raped a teenage girl in the Victorian seaside town of Torquay in 1999. News (9-5-2012)- "Man jailed for vicious rape of teen in Torquay 13 years ago"- A DNA sample taken after a minor drug offence in Queensland led to a man being jailed for seven and a half years today for the vicious rape of a teenager in Torquay in 1999. Judge Felicity Hampel said Peter Samuel was DNA tested after being convicted of marijuana possession in 2008 and a check with a national data base linked him to DNA material found on the jeans of a 15-year-old victim. Judge Hampel said that a jury at Samuel's trial heard that the odds were 120 million to one that the DNA came from another Caucasian male. Samuel lived in Torquay for less than a year in the late '90s before moving to Queensland with his family. Queensland has tough DNA laws and if Samuel had been charged with marijuana possession in Victoria he would not have been DNA tested and he would never have been caught. Judge Hampel said at the height of the holiday season in Torquay Samuel, 42, followed the girl as she walked home late at night. He bailed her up with a knife and forced her to clamber over a barbed wire fence at Torquay golf course where forced her to remove her clothes, held her face down and committed vaginal, oral and anal rapes. "She was subjected to a terrifying ordeal and she was violated,'' Judge Hampel told Samuel. "You had no respect for her. She was no more than an object to be used in any way you wished.'' Father of two Samuel, a plasterer of Maroochydore, was found guilty by a County Court jury of five counts of rape and committing an indecent act with a person under 16. Judge Hampel said Samuel's wife was pregnant at the time he raped the teenager, who was left devastated by the "random, shocking and life changing event''. On the night of the attack the victim believed she would die and she was left with a constant fear for her safety, flashbacks and had engaged in destructive behaviour and developed an eating disorder. In a victim impact statement she said she was determined to focus on the positives and realised life cannot be taken for granted. "Most of all I am happy to be alive,'' the victim said. Judge Hampel said Samuel's family was shocked at his conviction and he still maintained his innocence and she believed his chances of re-offending were low. She jailed Samuel for a maximum term of 10 and a half years. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/true-crime-scene/man-jailed-for-vicious-rape-of-teen-girl-in-torquay-13-years-ago/story-fnat7jnn-1226350776177

Andrew Scott Shenfield, 41, and Rebecca Louise Mahony, 33, were jailed for life by a Supreme Court judge in Brisbane last year for 30 offences including 13 counts of rape and torture. Their crimes against their 13-year-old victim were described as perverted degradation, that was not a nightmare for the victim but a living hell that left her with mental scarring she will carry for the rest of her life. Both appealed against their sentences. Mahony's appeal was dismissed after the Court of Appeal considered evidence she intended to kill her victim. Shenfield's life sentence, however, was reduced to 18 years because he had prevented Mahony from doing so. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-21/sentence-reduced-for-man-convicted-of-girl27s-rape2c-torture/4440774
ANDREW MARK SHEPPEARD (QLD)|yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 17-3-2011, in the Maroochydore Magistrates Court, to 9 months jail - with immediate release and placed on a 2 yr good Behaviour bond.|Andrew Sheppeard, pleaded guilty to 7 counts of using the Internet to access child pornography. Child porn videos land man in court- (18-3-2011) ANDREW Mark Sheppeard used his work computer to download more than a dozen videos of child pornography. His searches for adult pornography landed him in trouble when he started to uncover illegal videos. Sheppeard pleaded guilty yesterday in Maroochydore Magistrates Court to seven counts of using the Internet to access child pornography, a charge with a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail. The court heard Sheppeard first searched the words sex and porn to find adult videos. He noticed a lot of files included the acronym PTHC, which he began using to search for more videos. He said he did not know the acronym stood for pre teen hard core. Police raided the Sunshine Coast business Sheppeard worked for on September 11, 2009 and a forensic analyst found 14 videos of child pornography that had been deleted from his computer. Sheppeard said some videos were of children as young as five but as soon as he opened it he would delete it. Magistrate Bernadette Callaghan said Sheppeard's crime was serious and despicable. The fact that you've just accessed it (child pornography) through the Internet doesn't make it a victimless crime, Ms Callaghan said. Sheppeard was sentenced to nine months imprisonment with immediate release and placed on a two year good Behaviour bond. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2011/03/18/child-porn-downloads-land-coast-man-in-court/

News (9-5-2012)- "Carer abuses position of trust"- A TAXI driver who signed up to care for a severely disabled woman he just met before abusing her has been jailed, with the organisation that facilitated the arrangement admitting to "poor judgement". George James Simpson, 64, began a seven-month relationship with the 25-year-old woman, who has Asperger's syndrome, autism, epilepsy and an intellectual impairment in May 2006. Simpson met the woman when she ordered a cab outside Townsville Hospital on May 3, 2006 and she told him she had nowhere to go. He took the girl to the Disability Services Queensland department the following day, before signing an official agreement with Life Without Barriers to become her carer. He then moved her into his one-bedroom unit. Simpson was jailed after being found guilty in the Townsville District Court yesterday of six charges of indecent dealing with an intellectually impaired person under care, one of permitting an intellectually impaired person to indecent dealing and common assault. Life Without Barriers state director Scott Bray told the Bulletin the organisation exercised "poor judgement". "We sincerely regret the impact this has had on the woman involved," he said. Mr Bray said the organisation conducted personal history checks required by the Department of Child Safety at the time, including a criminal record check, all of which were cleared by the department. "Notwithstanding, it is clear that our policies and procedures were not properly implemented in this case and we deeply regret the impact of that poor practice," he said. "We sincerely apologise for our role in this matter." Judge Stuart Durward SC said he found the organisation's decision "pretty extraordinary" when sentencing the man. "I would have thought that arrangement would have cried out for investigation," he said. "It's a one-bedroom flat." Simpson was given a jail sentence of three years, to serve six months with an operational period of three years. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2012/05/09/328581_news.html

DARREN LEIGH SKIPSEY (QLD- Woombye)| |Served 9 yrs of a 10-yr jail sentence for repeatedly raping a female jogger in 2001.|Rapist. The judge described the 2001 sexual assault as "a callous and brutal" attack which was "disgusting and degrading". News (12-1-2012)- "Rapist 'stole' woman's security" SHE was sleeping on the top bunk inside an annex at a Mooloolaba caravan park her family had holidayed in for 40 years. The 25-year-old woke to a man touching her on the shoulder. She thought it was her father. When her eyes adjusted to the 4am light, she saw a stranger's "scary face" instead. Darren Leigh Skipsey placed a finger over his mouth and whispered "shhhhhh". The woman screamed, waking her boyfriend in the bottom bunk and her father inside the van. Skipsey, of Woombye, pleaded guilty in Maroochydore Magistrates Court yesterday to entering the premises with intent to steal money and assault on December 30. Police prosecutor Tanya Fitz Gerald said Skipsey had served nine years of a 10-year jail sentence for repeatedly raping a jogger in a "callous and brutal" attack in 2001. "The effect on the victim and that family was profound. It devastated her life," she said. Sergeant Fitz Gerald said the latest offences occurred six months after Skipsey's parole restrictions ended. She said the woman had visited the caravan park every one of her 25 years but had already changed her behaviour. "She's now not prepared to sleep in (the annex), she's now sleeping in the van. She is not even prepared to go to the toilet on her own. "In one night's incident, her whole life's changed. "Though the charge is enter to steal, (he) stole a lot more that night ... this woman's feeling of safety." Barrister David Crews said it was not a sexual offence and Skipsey should not be punished as if it was. He said his client went on a six-day bender and needed money. "He was in the annex looking for money," he said. "He didn't kiss her, he didn't touch her inappropriately, he touched her on the arm." Mr Crews said Skipsey accepted that he needed supervision after being thrown back into the community where there were many "temptations" like alcohol. "This is a slip-up because he was not properly reintegrated into the community," he said. Magistrate Bernadette Callaghan questioned whether better supervision and reintegration would have prevented another family suffering from this man's actions. Skipsey must serve three months of a nine-month jail term and two years of probation. Because he has already served 12 days, he will be released on parole on March 30. BRUTAL HISTORY- April 29, 2001 - A WOMAN was on a 6am jog when she helped a "lost" Darren Skipsey with directions. He drove off and lay in wait down the road, pretending he had car trouble, before he put a knife to her throat. He took her to a Nambour home and raped her nine times. The woman thought she was going to die. The judge described it as "a callous and brutal" attack which was "disgusting and degrading". He declared Skipsey a serious violent offender who must serve 80% of a 10-year sentence. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2012/01/12/rapist-has-stolen-womans-security/

Offence occurred 22-9-2012 at Willows Shopping Centre in Townsville. "Indecent carpark act leads to jail" (13-10-2012) Shopping Centre carpark while in possession of videos and photos of women around Townsville has been jailed for one month. But Magistrate Laurie Verra didn't place any weight on the recorded images, pointing out it wasn't illegal and that police hadn't charged Srejic for it. Robert Srejic, 60, pleaded guilty to an indecent act in a public place in Townsville Magistrates Court yesterday. He was sentenced to one month's jail, with an 18-month probation order to be served afterwards. Srejic was spotted by a woman "sweating profusely" and watching her with his window wound down, while his hand moved rigorously in an up-and-down movement on September 22 this year. The woman had two young children with her, and immediately called the police. Srejic was arrested with a large hole in the front of his shorts, which he claimed not to have noticed when he put them on. Police prosecutor Senior Sergeant Mick Harms said Srejic denied to police that he was masturbating in the carpark. "The defendant said his arm motion was due to a rash caused from work as a machine operator," he said. "He said he was taking photos of women entering Willows Shopping Centre due to urges, and intended on uploading them." A forensic order found no traces of such a rash. Defence lawyer Steve Erickson said his client's ute was elevated, and the bottom half of his body would have been out of view. "He does not receive gratification out of people seeing him," he said. Magistrate Laurie Verra took into account that Srejic did not intend to be seen. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2012/10/13/367661_news.html
PAUL ANDREW STANBROOK (Paul Stanbrook)  (QLD - Hermit Park)|43 yrs old (2010) |Sentenced in 1993 to 12 yrs jail - 10 yrs non parole..Sentenced in the Townsville District Court, to 5 yrs jail in 2008 - due for release in June 2013. |Paul Andrew stanbrook- Drugged and sexually assaulted a young woman in 2008/ found guilty of drink spiking and 5 counts of indecent treatment of a woman..Prior history - Bashed/ sexually assaulted and cut the throat of a 17 yr old schoolgirl in Wodonga in 1991. "Rapist fights dangerous sex offender order" (26-2-2013) A convicted rapist who drugged and sexually assaulted a young woman is arguing he should not be listed as a dangerous sexual offender because his crime was not violent. In June Paul Andrew Stanbrook is due for release from a five year jail sentence. He had been found guilty of drugging a 23-year-old with antidepressants and alcohol and inappropriately touching her while she lay awake but unable to move. The Attorney-General has applied for Stanbrook to be placed under a Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders') order on his release date, which could mean his jail term is extended or he is released into the community under a supervision order. The conditions of the supervision order could range from him being electronically monitored to having curfews and random drug and alcohol tests. Stanbrook is trying to fight the order, arguing he is not serving a prison term for a serious sexual offence because his crime was not violent. When Stanbrook was 42 years old, he became acquainted with the young woman and they swapped phone numbers after running into each other on July 21, 2008. He and his wife invited the woman over to watch a DVD that night, and Stanbrook gave her a drink which he said was alcohol and milk, but in fact was laced with the anti-depressant Endep. The woman sipped half of the drink over two hours and Stanbrook topped it up. After another couple of sips the woman fell asleep. The man then began touching her. "The victim woke but was unable to open her eyes and yet was aware of what the respondent and his wife were doing," the Supreme Court judgment said. Stanbrook moved the woman from the living room to the bedroom and repeatedly tried to put his hand between the victim's legs, but was unable to. The judgment said the woman was "distressed at her own helplessness" and since the assault had been prescribed anti-depressants. She was also unable to form a lasting relationship because she did not trust anyone. Supreme Court Judge Debbie Mullins has found there are reasonable grounds for Stanbrook to be classified as a dangerous sexual offender and has ordered he be evaluated by two psychiatrists. An application for the order will be heard on June 17. In her decision, Judge Mullins took into account Stanbrook's previous offences, which included the rape and assault of a 17-year-old school girl in Victoria in 1991. He saw the girl walking home from school and grabbed her from behind, taking her to a secluded spot where he raped and cut her throat with a small knife. He served 10 years for the crime and turned down numerous offers to take part in sexual offender rehabilitation programs. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/rapist-fights-dangerous-sex-offender-order-20130225-2f251.html "Drink spiker also convicted rapist" (14-4-2010) The man who lured a woman to his flat, drugged her by spiking her drink and then indecently as saulted her over several hours had served a lengthy jail term in Victoria for rape and attempted murder. A Townsville District Court jury took less than two hours to find Paul Andrew Stanbrook, 43, guilty of drink spiking and five counts of indecent treatment of a woman at his Hermit Park flat in 2008. Stanbrook had encouraged his intellectually impaired wife to take part in the fondling assaults on the woman. The jury heard that in July 2008, Stanbrook and his wife invited the woman, whom they had known for about three years, to come to their Hermit Park home and watch DVDs with them. The two women started to watch television while Mr Stanbrook went to the kitchen and mixed them drinks. The woman later said she had just been sipping hers, and when offered another one, said she didn't want to drink too much because she was pregnant. Nevertheless, Mr Stanbrook took the drink away and topped it up. The woman later said she had taken a couple of sips and the drink then ''tasted funny'' and she soon started feeling faint. The victim said she was unable to open her eyes or talk, and was unable to do anything when she felt the belt from her jeans being removed and Mandy Stanbrook telling her husband to take off her jeans. Her breasts and pubic area were then touched by the couple, before she was carried into the bedroom. She was put on the waterbed and then joined by the couple, one either side of her, and the fondling continued until all three fell asleep. The woman later woke up and went home. Later that day, after telling her parents what had happened, she went to the police where she gave a statement, and blood and urine samples. One of the samples contained traces of the drug amitriptyline, a sedative which becomes more potent when mixed with alcohol. There was expert evidence that the chemical does not occur naturally in the human body and is only available by prescription. During a subsequent search of the Stanbrook home, police seized a container with traces of the drug and a container marked off for measuring. At sentencing yesterday afternoon, Crown prosecutor Kerri Fredericks told Judge Stuart Durward that Stanbrook had been convicted of rape and attempted murder in Victoria in November 1992, when he had assaulted a 17-year-old and then cut her throat, leaving her for dead. Judge Durward told Stanbrook he had shown no remorse and that the offending would have required premeditation. For the charge of stupefying in order to commit an indictable offence (in this case, drink spiking) Stanbrook was jailed for five years, and was given terms of 18 months and 12 months for the five other counts, with all terms to be served concurrently. Given the almost two years Stanbrook has already spent in custody awaiting trial, Judge Durward directed that he could apply for parole in January next year. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/04/14/130145_news.html  http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/04/08/128665_news.html
SIMON PETER STEINFORT (Simon Steinfort) (QLD - Ipswich)|43 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in September 2006, in the Ipswich District Court, to 8 months jail - placed on probation for 3 yrs after being released.. Sentenced in 1999 to an intensive correction order.|Simon Peter Steinfort- Pleaded guilty to possessing child exploitation material.. Police raided his home in July 2009,and 12,764 images and videos of child pornography were found on Steinfort's computer.. Prior history in 1999 - received intensive correction order. Man jailed over child porn (2-9-2010) An Ipswich man was jailed for having child porn after his wife dobbed him in to police for the second time. Simon Peter Steinfort's wife stumbled across his stash of child exploitation material saved on his computer on July 10 last year and rang the police, who raided his Ipswich home the next day. But Ipswich District Court heard Steinfort's wife had previously also alerted the authorities 11 years ago when she uncovered his original stash. In 1999, Steinfort received an intensive correction order  which means he did not serve any time behind bars  and the court was told at the time he did not have a sexual interest in the material and it was just curiosity. Crown Prosecutor Jess Goldie said police discovered 12,764 images and videos of child pornography on Steinfort's computer towers last year. Steinfort told police he was bisexual and interested in young males in their early teens. Of images and videos found, only 883 were readily accessible as the others had been deleted or corrupted. Ms Goldie said 397 of the images and videos included young boys aged between six and 16 engaging in graphic sexual activities with each other and adults and were in the second-worst category. She said 97 images found on Steinfort's computer were considered in the worst category and involved sadism of young boys; 361 videos were also discovered. Steinfort, 40, pleaded guilty to possessing child exploitation material. He was sentenced to eight months' jail and will be on probation for three years after being released. Defence barrister Peter Sloane said his client was still in a relationship with his wife. Judge Sarah Bradley said Steinfort had to be jailed to send a message to the community that possessing child exploitation material would not be tolerated. There are real victims out there somewhere who have been the subject of these videos and images, Judge Bradley said. Without people like you who consume the images or access the images then this horrific industry probably would not exist. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/child-porn-images-man-jail-simon-steinfort/624845/

Pedophile allowed to teach - The court heard in 1980, Robert Brewster, the headmaster of the Toowoomba Preparatory School, was approached by a mother who claimed Strudwick had inappropriately touched her two daughters. After being confronted with the allegations, Strudwick resigned from the school but he was provided with a written reference from Mr Brewster. The reference, which said Strudwick left Toowoomba Prep with the school's blessing, read in part: "He has also captured the enthusiasm of his pupils demonstrating at all times his deep concern for their welfare and progress as well as maintaining the highest possible standards." The reference did not disclose any allegations of sexual misconduct. Strudwick was hired by the Queensland Education Department in October 1980 and taught at Darling Downs schools-below. News (23-8-2007)- "Pedophile allowed to teach"- A PEDOPHILE teacher used a glowing reference from an Anglican school to get a job in the state education system where he abused children, a court has heard. The headmaster of the Toowoomba Preparatory School gave Tony Jenner Strudwick a "very positive" reference despite Strudwick resigning after allegations he had molested two young girls. Strudwick used the reference to get a job with the Queensland Education Department and he later abused children at a Darling Downs primary school. The reference is now central to a personal injury claim by one of Strudwick's victims. Strudwick, 73, was released from jail in 2003 after serving all of his 11 years' sentence for 25 child sex offences including rape. In the Supreme Court yesterday, Justice Ann Lyons allowed an extension of time in which one of Strudwick's victims could bring an action against the Corporation of the Synod of the Diocese of Brisbane, which runs Toowoomba Prep. The State Government (for the Education Department) is named as a third party in the action. The court heard in 1980, Robert Brewster, the headmaster of the Toowoomba Preparatory School, was approached by a mother who claimed Strudwick had inappropriately touched her two daughters. After being confronted with the allegations, Strudwick resigned from the school but he was provided with a written reference from Mr Brewster. The reference, which said Strudwick left Toowoomba Prep with the school's blessing, read in part: "He has also captured the enthusiasm of his pupils demonstrating at all times his deep concern for their welfare and progress as well as maintaining the highest possible standards." The reference did not disclose any allegations of sexual misconduct. Strudwick was hired by the Queensland Education Department in October 1980 and taught at Darling Downs schools. While at Harlaxton Primary School, in Toowoomba, Strudwick molested two girls including a woman, who is now 33. Strudwick abused her from 1983, when he was her teacher, until 1992. In her Supreme Court action, the woman claims the reference enabled Strudwick to gain employment with the state Education Department which allowed him to have contact with her and then molest her. The matter can now go to trial. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/pedophile-allowed-to-teach/story-e6freoof-1111114244381

Queensland Corrective Services Minister Judy Spence said Paul Vincent Sutherland, who was released last week by Queensland's Supreme Court after spending 17 years in prison, had been moved to an undisclosed location. She said Sutherland had been staying at the Nerang address temporarily while he sought permanent accommodation but had been moved because of the continued media presence outside the home. Sutherland, now 48, has been convicted of sexually assaulting and killing women in the Bundaberg area in the late 1980s. In one instance he was charged with strangling a Bundaberg woman to death, stealing her jewellery and dumping her body in a canefield. .

However, a judge this morning made the order to release the pedophile, but did not reveal the location of his parents' home, which is reportedly on Brisbane's northside. Brisbane Supreme Court judge Peter Lyons today ordered Daniel Philip Sybenga, 28, be released immediately on a supervised order and allowed to live with his middle-aged mother and father. Sybenga, who has served more than three-and-a-half years longer than his full jail term for sexually molesting numerous young girls, will have to comply with 38 strict conditions, including wearing an electronic monitoring device or obey a curfew and stay away from shopping centres. Justice Lyons, who approved Sybenga's release on Monday, adjourned the hearing until this morning so the Queensland Department of Corrections could assess the suitability of Sybenga living with his parents upon release from jail. In making the order, Justice Lyons did not state where Sybenga would reside upon release, However, The Courier-Mail this morning learned Sybenga had been given approval to live with his parents. Sybenga was only 19 when he committed 16 counts of indecently dealing with nine children under the age of 12 in late 2002 and early 2003. Nine of the 16 offences involved him approaching small girls (aged five or six) in public places and exposing himself. In two cases he touched the children in an indecent manner. The other charges involved the molestation of a three-year-old girl. Sybenga was due for release on July 1, 2008, after his sentence was completed, but has remained in custody. Sybenga was released on an interim order in 2008, but became the subject of an on-going detention order under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 after Sybenga openly spoke about the likelihood of reoffending if released. However, two eminent psychiatrists yesterday testified Sybenga had "made significant gains'' since then _ having recently completed the High Intensity Sexual Offending Program.'' Specialist psychiatrist Dr Michael Beech told the court Sybenga had for the first time since abusing the children demonstrated "significant disgust and shame'' molesting them. But, he said Sybenga's deviant "entrenched pattern of sexual fantasies'' stemmed back to childhood and future arousal could be triggered by viewing adult pornography. Dr Beech said Sybenga had admitted that while in prison he could be easily aroused by reading a Penthouse magazine or "watching late-night SBS programs.'' Psychiatrist Dr Donald Grant said Sybenga appears "very genuine in his attitudes'' and feels "shamed and embarrassed'' by the impact his offending had on his child victims. Barrister Tim Ryan, for the Queensland Attorney-General, said if Sybenga was granted supervised release the order should be imposed for a minimum of 10-years. Mr Ryan said Sybenga would also be subjected to strict conditions, including electronic monitoring or curfew and being forbidden from visiting shopping centres and accessing pornography of any kind. Barrister Mark Green, for Sybenga, said his client's parents had agreed to house the convicted pedophile upon his release. Justice Glenn Martin in 2009 ordered Sybenga be detained because he remained a high risk of reoffending. In September 2010, Justice James Douglas, after also reviewing psychiatric evidence, found Sybenga remained a danger. "His aberrant views about the logic of behaviour towards young girls remain firmly entrenched,'' he said. Justice Douglas found Sybenga's parents were not appropriate supervisors because of concern as to whether they could provide adequate security at home, and their lack of training. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/sex-fiend-daniel-philip-sybenga-to-live-with-parents/story-e6freoof-1226333025643 News (1-9-2010)- "Pedophile should not go free"- A notorious pedophile should be kept in jail because he will reoffend if released, a court has been told.

TRENT WESLEY SYKES (QLD- Brisbane)|31 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 11-6-2009, in the Toowoomba District Court, to 15 months jail - to be released after having served 6 months to then be subject to 2 yrs probation and 2 yrs good behaviour.|Trent Wesley Sykes - Child Pornography Offence/s. News (12-6-2009)- "Pervert jailed over child porn" Child pornography pervert Trent Wesley Sykes will spend the next six months behind bars for downloading shocking sexual images of children. Some of the images found on the computer used by the 28-year-old to access child pornography included sexual acts by adults with children as young as three to nine-months-old, Toowoomba District Court heard yesterday. Judge Walter Tutt was scathing in his sentencing remarks, describing as "nauseating" and "revolting" the images downloaded by Sykes, copies of which were handed to the court. "One can only speculate as to what depths the mind must sink," Judge Tutt said referring to those who downloaded such material. Sykes was located in Toowoomba in May last year by the Australian Federal Police Child Protection Online Team, responsible for co-ordinating Australias wing of a world-wide police operation cracking down on child exploitation material and pedophile rings. Commonwealth prosecutor Kylie Ward said a search of the material Sykes had accessed included 89 images of child exploitation material depicting naked girls aged five to 14 in various poses, and scenes of adults engaged in sex acts with children aged from three months to 10 years. Because Sykes had no computer of his own, he had accessed the images via his father-in-laws computer during visits to his then-wifes parents home. A subsequent search of Sykes Rangeville home had found an external hard disc drive which contained further images of child pornography, Ms Ward said. The prosecution had sought a sentence of 15 months jail to serve an actual term of about one-third followed by probation. However, Sykes barrister Robbie Davies said, though the website images were "revolting material", his clients offending had been at the lower end of the scale. Mr Davies tended to the court five comparable sentences of similar charges where the offending, in his opinion, was much worse and where the offenders received no jail time at all. His client had already suffered some penalty in that, once his charges became public, he had lost his wife, his job, his reputation and had since had to relocate to Brisbane, he said. Sykes had not transmitted any of the material and would now be subject to the Sex Offenders Register. Mr Davies submitted a fully suspended sentence or intensive correction order. Judge Tutt said: "I must say I am somewhat surprised that the sentences imposed on these types of offences are so low." He sentenced Sykes to 15 months jail, to be released after having served six months to then be subject to two years probation and two years good behaviour. Sykes was also sentenced to 12 months jail, suspended after four months, with the balance to hang over his head for the next two years. http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/pervert-jailed-over-child-porn/247692/ http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-09-11/man-loses-child-porn-sentence-appeal/1425736|/images/trent_wesley_sykes_2.jpg

MARC BRUCE TALLY (QLD- Bundaberg West)|28 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Marc Bruce Tally. Convicted Sex Offender- Pleaded guilty in Bundaberg Magistrates Court to one charge of attempting to change his name as a reportable offender. Sex offender tried to change name- (30-7-2012) A CONVICTED sex offender has faced court after trying to change his surname without the consent of the Police Commissioner. Marc Bruce Tally, 28, of Bundaberg West, pleaded guilty in Bundaberg Magistrates Court yesterday to one charge of attempting to change his name as a reportable offender. Police prosecutor Senior Constable Fiona Ward said Tally became a reportable offender under the Child Protection Act last year after being convicted of having a consensual relationship with a girl under the age of consent. Snr Const Ward said Tally had been issued with and signed two sets of paperwork concerning his rights and obligations as a reportable offender, which were also explained to him - one of those being that he had to seek consent from the Commissioner before trying to change his name. But earlier this year, Tally made an application to the New South Wales Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages to have his surname changed to Taliana. "The defendant said he was not intentionally deceiving anyone," Snr Const Glover said. "He said he was looking at moving to New South Wales to start a new job and he wanted to start under a new name. "The offence itself is quite a significant breach." Lawyer Warren Highland said his client was not aware he had to ask the Commissioner's permission to change his name and only found out when the registry told him. Mr Highland said Tally then contacted the Bundaberg Police Station to ask how to go about seeking permission. "My client prior to this matter has complied in every respect in relation to his obligations under the act," he said. "The name Taliana was a family name ... so it's not simply a name he's picked out of the air." Mr Highland said his client planned to move interstate because he had been offered a job as the assistant manager of a bowling alley. "He wanted to change back to the original family name and wanted to move on," he said. The court heard Tally was subject to a suspended sentence at the time of the offence. Magistrate Jennifer Batts adjourned the sentence to August 13 so she could take into consideration the transcript from Tally's original sentence that landed him on the reportable offender list. http://www.news-mail.com.au/story/2012/07/30/sex-offender-tried-change-name/

News (2-6-2012)- "Accused cop biter is refused bail"- A MAN accused of biting a police officer at Ipswich Hospital on Wednesday night had to be dragged from the dock at court on Thursday after he was refused bail. Matthew David Taylor, 34, a reportable sex offender, is accused of biting and punching two officers after allegedly getting into a fight at the hospital. As officers tried to arrest Taylor, he allegedly struck out at one of the officers in the face. The other officer attempted to restrain Taylor, but was allegedly bitten on the arm and his left hand, which drew blood and will result in the officer having a disease test. Taylor's defence applied for bail and said he would be contesting the charges but police prosecutors opposed bail as Taylor had a history for failing to appear in court and failing to comply with his duties to report as a sex offender. When Magistrate Hayden Stjernqvist refused bail, Taylor started arguing and became hostile. He was handcuffed by a police officer and court house security provided extra assistance. His case will next be mentioned on June 20. http://www.gympietimes.com.au/story/2012/06/02/accused-ipswich-cop-biter-is-refused-bail/

News (6-2-2012)- "Child sex offender jailed again"- RAYMOND Tetley is a registered child sex offender who has been jailed - again - for failing to report a change of residential address to police. Tetley, a 41-year-old concreter, has now been convicted seven times since 2005 for failing to comply with his reporting conditions. The known sex offender was jailed for eight months in December 2009 for his sixth offence. Now he is back in jail for another offence. Tetley was convicted of a child sex offence in 2000 and was sent to jail. When he was released in September 2005 he was given a notice to report annually to police until 2020. Under the conditions of the Australian National Child (Sex) Offenders Registry, known as ANCOR, a registered offender has numerous obligations to report details such as a change of address, a change of employer, any changes in their physical appearance, the details of any vehicles they own or use, even the clubs of which they become members. The Mackay Magistrate's Court heard on Friday that Tetley went to a South Mackay residence on January 19 looking for his former female partner, was told to leave by the occupants and was then involved in an altercation with two brothers who both suffered minor injuries. One of them fought him off with a walking stick. Police later located Tetley behind a hotel in River St. Inquiries revealed he had no residential address. He had left his Bakers Creek caravan last October without notifying police and then had lived at Alligator Creek for several months without telling authorities. Tetley pleaded guilty to four charges including failing to report as required as a registered sex offender. Magistrate Mark Morrow jailed him for nine months, to be released on parole on April 20.

The device alerted staff that Tiers had his violated curfew at 6.06pm and he was contacted. Tiers was contacted again at 6.21pm and ordered to return home. But officers received two "Strap Tamper" alerts a short time later, sparking a two-hour search for the convicted criminal. Tiers was eventually found with his girlfriend at Hotel Allen, on the corner of Warburton and Gregory streets in Townsville, about 9pm.

Trevor Toms, 42, was fitted with an electronic tag to monitor his movements following his release from prison last November over three rapes he committed in North Queensland in 1986. Corrective Services officers allegedly spotted Toms in a car with sexual sadist and convicted pedophile Robert John Fardon about 11.30pm on Wednesday, in contravention of Toms' 10pm curfew. The pair were questioned about their activities but are said to have lied about where they had been. Police were later granted search warrants to arrest the pair on suspicion that they had breached the conditions of strict supervision orders imposed following their release from jail. Toms has served a 22-year sentence for the 1986 rapes, all committed in the space of five weeks. Fardon was first jailed in 1978 for raping a 12 year-old girl and bashing her 15 year-old sister with a gun. He was released on parole in 1988, but just 20 days later raped an sodomised another woman in a vicious attack. He left prison in October last year after a failed bid by the State Government to have him permanently detained. Both men are now believed to be living in government housing inside prison grounds at Wacol, west of Brisbane. A Supreme Court judge this afternoon granted an application by Queensland Attorney General Kerry Shine to have Toms put back in jail while investigators compile evidence in the case against him. If successful, he could be subjected to a fresh supervision order or detained indefinitely. Toms, who sat in the prisoner's dock for the brief hearing, is facing charges of breaching his supervision order by failing to abstain from alcohol, using illicit drugs, namely cannabis, and failing to comply with his 10pm to 6am nightly curfew. He will undergo psychiatric examination and be held until July 23, when the matter is expected to be finalised Fardon, 58, who is charged with failing to abstain from violations of the law and failing to respond truthfully to inquiries about his whereabouts, is expected to be dealt with later today. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/tagged-sex-offender-back-in-prison/2007/07/13/1183833745549.html

Pleading guilty to 5 charges-2 counts of using a carriage service to procure a child under 16 to perform a sexual act, 2 counts of making child exploitation material and 1 count of possessing child exploitation material. News (18-8-2011)- "Former teacher and coach gets suspended jail term for enticing girls to send sex photos" A FORMER high school teacher and prominent athletics coach has avoided jail despite enticing two promising 15-year-old athletes to send him sexually provocative photos of themselves via the internet or mobile phone. Former Sarina State High School teacher David Trudgian, 40, was sentenced to a wholly suspended 18-month jail term after pleading guilty in the Brisbane District Court to five charges, including using the internet to procure the two elite child athletes to perform sex acts. The court was told the then central Queensland-based teacher and respected athletics coach met the girls, who attended a separate high school in another northern area, during a series of elite athletic tournaments between October and December 2007. Prosecutor Dennis Kinsella said Trudgian, then aged 37, was a prominent sprint coach who began giving the pair advice after tournaments in Townsville and at Brisbane's state and Sydney's national athletic championships. He said while Trudgian did not coach the girls, he offered to give them advice to help them fulfil their sporting aspirations. However, the court was told that relationship soured when internet and mobile phone text message communications spiralled downward from "innocent through to flirtation to sexually explicit." Mr Kinsella said Trudgian sent the girls a total of 2384 mobile phone text messages - including requests they pose nude and send him naked photographs of themselves between September 30, 2007, and February 1, 2008. He said Trudgian received 11 images - deemed to be child exploitation - from the girls, and that all of them could be found "intact" or recovered after being deleted from the teacher's phone or computer. The court was told police found the offensive images after searching his home after one of the girl's revealed what happened to one of her school teachers. Mr Kinsella said Trudgian moved to live in Melbourne in the wake of the police investigation. Trudgian originally pleaded guilty in early July to two counts of using a carriage service, meaning the internet or phone, to procure a child under 16 to perform a sexual act, two counts of making child exploitation material and one count of possessing child exploitation material. Barrister Dan O'Gorman, SC, for Trudgian, said both his client's teaching and coaching careers were ruined as a result of these offences and that Trudgian was now engaged as a full-time house dad to his one-year-old daughter. He said Trudgian and his heavily pregnant wife continue to live in Melbourne and are expecting the birth of their second child in two months. "What he (Trudgian) engaged in (with these girls) was stupid flirting that got out of control," Mr O'Gorman said. Judge Hugh Botting, in sentencing Trudgian, said: "These are ... serious offences and have had serious consequences for these two girls." "It is difficult to understand ... why you committed these offences." Judge Botting ordered Trudgian's prison term be wholly suspended for three years. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/former-teacher-and-coach-gets-suspended-jail-term-for-enticing-girls-to-send-sex-photos/story-e6freoof-1226117543989

In Brisbane District Court today David Robert Adam Uhlmann, 30, pleaded guilty to the attack and a charge of extortion relating to phone calls he made to a family threatening violence from a bikie gang if they did not pay $50. The court heard the married father from Petrie, in Brisbane's north, had been drinking when he saw a 19-year-old woman who used to live near him walking along Anzac Avenue at Redcliffe in April 2009. The woman was upset after arguing with her boyfriend and Uhlmann offered her a place to stay overnight. She refused and began to walk away but Uhlmann grabbed her and pulled her down the driveway of the funeral parlour. He pushed her up against a roller door, telling her: "I don't want to hurt you ... I just want to admire your body." Crown prosecutor Glen Cash said the woman protested and said "no" several times but Uhlmann sexually assaulted and raped her. The woman managed to get away and told her boyfriend about the ordeal.

Was already serving a jail sentence relating to the abuse of several boys between 2001 and 2004. See also - Leigh William Andrews and Earl James Henderson. News (5-11-2007)- "Qld paedophiles given longer sentences"- Three members of a Brisbane paedophile ring have had their prison sentences extended after US authorities seized photographs of them involved in child sex acts. Leigh William Andrews, 27, Shannon Lee Voigt, 31, and Earl James Henderson, 33, all of Caboolture, pleaded guilty in Brisbane District Court to dozens of indecent dealing offences. All three are already serving lengthy sentences relating to the abuse of several boys between 2001 and 2004. However, the court heard fresh charges were brought after US authorities located photographs of Voigt and Andrews involved in sex acts with the children. The photos were passed on to Queensland police who re-interviewed each of the defendants, resulting in new confessions. Henderson admitted to taking many of the photos and being involved in procuring sex acts between the children but was not represented in any of the pictures. Judge Milton Griffin extended each of the men's sentences, handed down in 2005, by 18 months. Andrews will now serve a total of eight-and-a-half years while Henderson will serve nine-and-a-half years and Voigt 10-and-a-half years. However, Henderson will be eligible for bail after completing a sex offender program while Andrews will become eligible in May next year. Voigt will remain in prison until at least September 2009. http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/qld-paedophiles-given-longer-sentences-20071105-18bn.html http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/abusers-get-more-jail-time/story-e6freoof-1111114808102

Child Abduction- Amber Alert "Make friends, sex fiend told" (15-6-2011) A Convicted pedophile with a history of abducting young girls off the street needed to brush up his social skills so he would no longer be a high risk of reoffending in a significant way, a court was told yesterday. The Supreme Court in Brisbane heard Shane Waghorn remained a high risk to the community but if he continued with one-on-one therapy with a psychologist there was a chance he could be released late this year on a supervised order. Should he be returned to the community this year, he could be among the first currently incarcerated sex offenders in Queensland subject to monitoring by 24-hour GPS technology. Premier Anna Bligh last week announced the new system after bowing to pressure from a public campaign to replace the electronic tags used to track sex offenders. Waghorn has not completed a High Intensity Sex Offenders Program because he claimed to have been victimised by staff and other prisoners. Waghorn, now 51, was jailed for 14 years in 1992 after he attacked a 10-year-old girl as she walked home. He grabbed her, forced her into his car and later sexually assaulted her. .

LEON FREDERICK WALLACE (QLD)|38 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 13 yrs jail.|Leon Wallace. Rapist. News (9-3-2011)- A PRISONER who spat on a "working correctional officer" had a long history of assaulting jail staff dating back nearly 20 years, a court heard. Leon Frederick Wallace, 37, was before a court for the third time for assaulting prison officers. In 1994, Wallace was serving 13 years for a rape when he was convicted in the Supreme Court in Brisbane on a charge of attempting to murder a prison officer. Records of that trial showed Wallace joined in an attack on an officer at the Sir David Longland jail, smashing an acoustic guitar and a heavier electric guitar over the officer's head before hurling a television set at him. He was jailed for a further 10 years on the attempted murder charge, and then received another 18 months jail term when convicted of assault occasioning bodily harm of another prison officer at the Lotus Glen jail, in far north Queensland. Wallace's full time release date was in October 2015. However, in the District Court in Brisbane today, Wallace pleaded guilty to the serious assault of a working correctional officer at the Wolston correctional centre, on May 25, 2009. The court heard Wallace had told authorities he did not want a visit from a cultural affairs officer. When the officer was talking through the cell door, Wallace became upset, kicked the door and spat. The court heard his saliva landed on the officer's face. Barrister Simon Hamlin-Harris, for Wallace, said his client's behaviour had to be considered in the light of a psychiatric condition, which while not a mental illness, had an impact on the way Wallace behaved. He said Wallace was eligible for parole in April 2002 but seemed likely to serve his entire sentence, so any further jail term should be reduced to reflect his guilty plea. Judge David Searles said Wallace's actions had caused the cultural officer considerable psychological distress and it was vital proper control was kept in prisons. He added two months to Wallace's sentence, meaning his full time release date is now December 2015. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/leon-frederick-wallace-has-two-months-added-to-sentence-after-being-convicted-for-spitting-on-correctional-officer/story-e6freon6-1226018385172

Convicted of wilful exposure in February 2010 and was fined $200. Conviction for indecent treatment in 2007. News (16-3-2011)- "Serial flasher behind bars"- AN IPSWICH man who exposed himself twice to unsuspecting women has been sentenced to more than five months in jail. A family with young children and two 17-year-old girls were in Leichhardt Park on November 27 when they noticed a man lying on his stomach. The family left. The teenagers felt uncomfortable and started to leave, but Timothy Llewellyn Keith Warren jumped a fence and followed them. As the teens reached their car Warren stood nearby and exposed himself. The girls hopped in their car, drove away and called police. Just five days later, Warren struck again, offending a woman walking in One Mile. A woman was walking along Old Toowoomba Road on December 2 about 11.35am when she noticed Warren standing with his back to her but looking over his shoulder and smiling. She was about a metre away when Warren turned around and she noticed he was exposing himself over the waistband of his shorts. Warren pleaded guilty in Ipswich Magistrates Court to committing an indecent act with intent, committing an indecent act in a public place, breaching bail and contravening a direction. He was sentenced to five months and seven days in jail with 34 days of pre-sentence custody declared time already served. Warren, 27, will be eligible to apply for parole on May 10 but Magistrate Donna MacCallum said he was highly unlikely to be released before serving his entire term. The court heard Warren was convicted of wilful exposure in February last year and was fined $200 and he had a previous conviction for indecent treatment in 2007. Prosecutor Sergeant Paul Caldwell said the community needed to be protected from Warren. Defence lawyer Matthew Fairclough said his client, who normally lived with his mother at Leichhardt, had been assessed by a psychiatrist who could not diagnose him with any psychiatric condition. But Mr Fairclough said Warren was voluntarily taking anti-psychotic medication while in jail. It might reduce any urges he might have, he said. http://www.ipswichadvertiser.com.au/story/2011/03/16/serial-flasher-behind-bars/

With 6 months already served, he will be eligible for parole in 4 months from November 2011.|Pleaded guilty to 7 child sex offences including indecent treatment and making child exploitation material. Victim was a boy abused from the age of 11 yrs. News (3-11-2011)- "Jail for child sex"- A well-known paraplegic planning to be the first person to jet-ski around the world has been labelled a "manipulative sexual predator" for wanting to marry a teenage boy he sexually abused. Marek Stanislaw Waszkiewicz, known as "Voski", pleaded guilty to seven child sex offences against the child who was aged 11 during the initial offending - including indecent treatment and making child exploitation material. The offences occurred during Waszkiewicz's "Global Jet Ski Rally" between 2009 and 2010 - when he sought publicity to raise $2 million in donations and sponsorship. Crown Prosecutor Nathan Turner said the 41-year-old had given the teen alcohol, a video console and games, phone credit, cigarettes, clothing and money - in exchange for sleepovers that involved taking naked photographs and sexual favours including oral sex, touching and kissing. Mr Turner said Waszkiewicz also hid the boy from police and his parents when he ran away. Mr Turner said Waszkiewicz "was of the belief they were in a relationship" - wanting to get married, threatening suicide if they broke up and giving his victim Valentine's Day gifts. The prosecutor said Waszkiewicz was bailed for the offending but continued to rendezvous with the child and tried to get him to withdraw his statement. "It is clear grooming behaviour and he took advantage of a troubled youth," Mr Turner said. Defence barrister Vivianna Keegan said her client, who has no use of his lower-legs due to Guillian Barre syndrome, "corrupted" the teen - but hadn't used violence or sodomised the child. Judge Stuart Baulch SC said Waszkiewicz, who will be a reportable child sex offender for the next 10 years, preyed upon his victim in "a disgraceful display of self gratification". Waszkiewicz was sentenced to 12 months' jail for the child exploitation charges, suspended for four years, and two years for the indecent treatment offences, suspended after serving 10 months. Due to six months already served, he will be eligible for parole in four months. http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2011/11/03/279861_news.html|/images/marek_waszkiewicz.jpg

The girl's grandmother found Watt raping the child in a house on Mornington Island..The child was seriously injured in the attack and was hospitalised/ needed surgery. "Court rejects rapist as a 'dangerous sexual offender'" (23-4-2013) A bid to have a Queensland man who raped a three-year-old toddler classified as a dangerous sexual offender has been rejected in the states Supreme Court. Hans Lester Watt, 42, raped the little girl in 2001 when he was drunk in an act of revenge against the girl's grandmother who he claimed had insulted his dead mother, the Brisbane Times reports. The girl's grandmother found the man raping the child in a house on Mornington Island. He was sentenced to 11 years' jail for the crime. Last year, ahead of his release, the Queenslands attorney-general's office applied to have the offender classified as a dangerous sexual offender. But the court found the circumstances of the rape were "unique". One of the three psychiatrists who examined Mr Watt said he was at low-risk of re-offending if he did not drink but that risk rose to "moderate" if he consumed alcohol. Despite this, the judge was not satisfied there was an unacceptable risk that Mr Watt would reoffend and did not put him on a supervision order. The attorney-general appealed the decision, saying it was a "very serious crime" which showed what Mr Watt was capable of doing. However, the Supreme Court found that Mr Watt was not considered a paedophile and that it was the only time he had taken his anger out on someone who had not provoked him. http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/04/23/14/38/bid-to-have-rapist-classified-as-dangerous-sex-offender-rejected http://au.news.yahoo.com/today-tonight/lifestyle/article/-/16852210/child-rapist-walks-free/ http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/court-rejects-3yos-rapist-a-dangerous-sexual-offender-20130422-2iahs.html "Revenge rapist to be set free" (2-10-2012) http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2012/10/02/234557_local-news.html

The images included children, some as young as five, engaged in sex acts, the Rockhampton Magistrates Court was told. Andrew Graham Watts, 35, pleaded guilty to possessing objectionable computer games. Police prosecutor Constable Calvin Gnech said police had found the images on an open lap- top computer during a search of Watts's Yeppoon residence. The computer was forwarded to an examination unit in Brisbane and a total of 11,000 pornographic images were found. "More than 100 depicted young children under 16,'' Constable Gnech said. Watts's solicitor, Alan Grant, said the computer had belonged to his client's brother. Watts had taken up an intro- ductory one-month internet con- nection trial, he said. Mr Grant said Watts suffered from bipolar disorder, which af- fected a person's judgment. "More importantly they (suffer- ers) don't think through the con- sequences of their actions,'' Mr Grant said. Magistrate Bronwyn Springer said the offence was serious as children were vulnerable people within the community and should not be violated, including by "consumers''.

Man jailed for sexual assault- (15-6-2012) A visibly shaken and nervous woman told Rockhampton District Court how in May last year, a man climbed onto her upstairs veranda, broke into her bedroom and sexually assaulted her. Yesterday John Weeding, after a two-day trial, was found guilty of unlawful and indecent assault and sentenced to 3 years in jail. He has already served 191 days. The woman, who can't be named, told the court on Wednesday that she had previously met Weeding on two occasions; once when they smoked marijuana after a night out with a mutual acquaintance, and again when he broke into her house demanding "cones". The complainant was the only witness and told the jury she froze when she saw Weeding, whom she knew as John Boy, break in through the sliding door into her bedroom. She claimed Weeding was carrying a knife and threatened that if she didn't shut up, he would kill her, though she conceded Weeding had scissors and not a knife. Weeding grabbed the woman, tearing her knickers before she escaped out the back door with Weeding chasing her. She was able to run back upstairs and lock the door behind her. Defence barrister Ross Lo Monaco told the jury that in the absence of eyewitnesses or any evidence of an independent nature, it was a case of word against word. He said her evidence contained grave inconsistencies and the case would come down to the jury's view of the complainant's credibility and reliability. Weeding's barrister, Josh Phillips, told the court that just because someone smoked marijuana, it didn't necessarily make them unreliable. The jury returned its verdict yesterday afternoon after deliberating for less than three hours. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/story/2012/06/15/man-jailed-for-sexual-assault-on-woman-after-climb/

"Pedophile teacher to serve more jail time" (22-12-2009) A former sex educator who paid teenage boys to inject medication into his penis will serve more jail time after Queensland Attorney-General Cameron Dick sought a harsher sentence on appeal. In November 2008, retired Maryborough primary school teacher, sex educator and child carer David Leslie Wharton, 68, was sentenced to three years' prison, suspended after six months, after pleading guilty to crimes he committed 20 years previously. At the time, the court heard that he groomed a 14-year-old boy into stripping off and exercising for him in 1988 and 1989. In a written Court of Appeal judgment delivered on Tuesday, papers said the more clothes the boy removed, the more the teacher would pay him. "The respondent then massaged the boy and fondled his genitals," documents said. In September 2009, Wharton pleaded guilty to numerous charges of indecent treatment of a child, relating to offences which occurred during camping trips between December 2004 and July 2008. For these offences he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, to be suspended after 114 days. Court papers said Wharton started supplying the boys with alcohol during the trips and in 2005 he began a "dare book", listing prizes to be awarded for sexual activities. As a result, one of the boys injected erectile dysfunction medication into the man's penis on four separate occasions. Three of those times, while Wharton was on bail for the crimes he committed in 1988 and 1989, he paid the boy $10. In court on Tuesday, Wharton's legal aid lawyer, Mark Green, argued for the suspended sentence to remain the same, as one of the victims had later confronted Wharton and his wife and held them at gunpoint, before firing off a shot. "There is also leniency given when an offender suffers some retribution at the hands of the victim," Mr Green said. However, in a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeal ordered Wharton serve a total of 14 months actual imprisonment time for all offences. He has already served a total of nine and a half months and will now have to serve a further four and a half months. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/pedophile-teacher-to-serve-more-jail-time-20091222-lbj6.html|/images/david_leslie_wharton_2.jpg

GRAHAM CHARLES WICKSON (Graham Wickson) (QLD - Brisbane)|52 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced 2-11-2006, in the Brisbane District Court, to 4 yrs Jail.|Graham Charles Wickson - Found guilty by a Brisbane District Court jury in Nov 2006, of six counts of indecently dealing with a boy under 16 years, and one count of indecently dealing with a boy under 14 years. "Abuse past rebounds" (3-11-2006) A martial arts instructor and former air cadets leader has been jailed for four years after being convicted of sexually abusing four teenage boys in the 1970s. Graham Charles Wickson, 52, a state advertising manager, was found guilty by a Brisbane District Court jury yesterday of six counts of indecently dealing with a boy under 16 years and one count of indecently dealing with a boy under 14 years. He was found not guilty of a further charge of indecently dealing with a boy under 16 years, and the jury was hung on a ninth charge  which was later annulled by the Crown. During the week-long trial, the court heard the offences happened in the 1970s while Wickson, then aged 20-23 years, was involved with co-ordinating air cadet groups or students for his Brighton kung fu school. He was a member of the RAAF reserves until 1978. The court heard the boys, aged 13 to 15 years, were systematically corrupted for Wickson's sexual gratification  which included offences of touching, oral sex, masturbation and indecent photography. A police raid on Wickson's home found old photographs of young boys at campsites and kung fu tournaments  some of which were inscribed with terms such as "my special little friend". Two victim impact statements read to the court detailed the significant impact the offences had on the men  each of whom described depression, suicidal thoughts, anger, drug and alcohol abuse, sexual confusion and relationship difficulties. One described how he was "brainwashed" by the charismatic Wickson, and at 15 years was persuaded to live with him and another since-convicted pedophile when his own father died. He was regularly molested for several years. The victim also said Wickson had convinced people he was a "messiah" who could diagnose illnesses by reading auras and iridology  using this so-called power to keep his young victims submissive. Judge Michael Forde said Wickson had shown absolutely no remorse and provided no co-operation to police. "It's a pity someone like yourself who had so much to offer in terms of leadership and nurturing young boys' potential . . . have abused that trust and potential," Judge Forde said. He said any benefit to possibly hundreds of other boys over the years had been ruined by his conduct towards the four victims. Wickson showed no emotion as Judge Forde sentenced him to four years' jail. Yesterday lawyer Simon Harrison said a civil class action was expected to be launched against Wickson and the RAAF on behalf of several other men, not involved in yesterday's case, who also claimed to be abuse victims. www.couriermail.com.au

But the sentencing judge said she was bound by case law in making her decision. He will serve less time than we took to arrest him. That is the reality, police said after the sentence. It is absolutely disgusting. It was a horrendous and brutal attack. His victim has to live with what happened for the rest of her life and now her rapist could be back on the streets in 2 years. Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie said he would consider appealing against the decision. I will review the case and seek advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Bleijie said. Sentencing Williams, Judge Julie Dick SC accepted great harm had been caused to the victims family. All rapes are serious and revolting, she said. I accept the effect on the family has been extreme. But she also considered Williams had shown remorse by confessing upon his arrest and she accepted a medical report stating he was a low risk of reoffending as long he stayed away from drugs. She rejected a call by the DPP to hand down a 10-14 year jail sentence with a serious violent offender declaration that could see him serve 80 per cent of his sentence. She said the case was not as serious as other brutal rapes which featured weapons, death threats or prolonged, gratuitous violence. .|/images/richard-quincy-williams-2.jpg

Prior history includes indecent dealing with a child under 14 yrs, and abduction.  "Pedophile had child porn" (11-8-2011) A convicted sex offender caught with child pornography videos and images on his computer has faced court. Matthew James Wilson, a 47-year-old man who was convicted in 2001 of abducting and indecently treating a child, was living on a boat in the Burnett River when police raided the vessel in October last year. He was arrested and jailed for two years for assuming the identity of a dead man to evade authorities, which breached his sex offender register obligations. Prosecutor Dzenita Balic yesterday told Bundaberg District Court when Wilson was arrested and officers seized his laptop, he admitted there may be child exploitation material on it. When Wilson was released on parole in June this year, he walked out of jail to find police officers waiting to arrest him and charge him with possessing child abuse material and using a carriage service to access child exploitation material. A video, which ran for 34 minutes, showing a man engaging in sexual activities with a girl aged about 11 or 12, was found on Wilson's laptop along with two sexual images of children. Mr Wilson is a reportable sex offender until May 2013, Ms Balic said - . http://www.news-mail.com.au/news/pedophile-had-child-porn/932652/

STEVEN WOODS (QLD - Sunshine Coast/ Wurtulla)|57 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in April 2007, in the Maroochydore District Court, to 2 yrs jail - to be suspended after serving 3 months in jail, conditional on him not re-offending for a period of three years.|Steven Woods used online chat rooms to proposition children to engage in sexual acts on the internet..Pleaded guilty to 18 offences. "Sunshine Coast paedophile sentenced" (2-4-2007) A Wurtulla man who used online chat rooms to proposition children to engage in sexual acts on the internet has been sentenced to two years imprisonment, to be suspended after serving three months in jail, but the sentence being conditional on him not re-offending for a period of three years. Steven Woods pleaded guilty in the Maroochydore District Court today to 18 offences. Between 23 May and 25 August 2005, Woods used internet chat rooms to proposition three 13-year-old girls. What he did not know was that the girls he propositioned were actually undercover police officers from the Crime and Misconduct Commission, who were posing as children. The 51-year-old man groomed the girls during 11 separate internet chat room conversations. He used elaborate methods to desensitise them to sexually explicit material and propositioned them to engage in sexual acts. Head of the CMCs criminal paedophilia investigations Detective Inspector Sue Dawson says Woods is one of the worst offenders the team has encountered. The fact that Woods sought to engage three girls over three months shows how persistent and desperate he was to contact a child. While in this case he happened to contact three undercover CMC officers instead, there remains the potential for others like him to hurt real children, Detective Inspector Dawson said. This case shows how child sex offenders are using the internet to commit serious crimes and maintain anonymity. The CMC will continue to monitor the internet to track and catch these paedophiles. http://www.cmc.qld.gov.au/news-and-media/media-releases/media-releases-19-july-2006-28-june-2007/media-release-02.04.2007-sunshine-coast-paedophile-sentenced.asp-pgid-10814-cid-5201-id-992

News (17-5-2012)- A teacher who admitted to collecting and viewing more than 8000 images of child pornography has avoided a jail term. The move has sparked calls from child welfare campaigners to get tough on child porn offenders. Former Greensborough Secondary College teacher Henry Redden walked from court yesterday, despite pleading guilty to collecting the staggering stash and transmitting some of the disturbing material. The 60-year-old was suspended without pay from the college in December after federal police raided his home and seized laptops, a DVD and a hard drive full of pictures and videos of young children in explicit acts. Some of the material depicted graphic images of children engaged in sexual activity with adults. County Court Judge Howard Mason said apart from the offending Redden had led "an exemplary life'' and had a good reputation as a teacher. He said Redden, who had no prior criminal history, had struggled with his sexual identity and turned to child pornography because of confusion. "Your attention to the type of content you accessed over the internet developed from your sexual confusion, began with adult pornography, and expanded through confusion and voyeurism,'' he said. "Child pornography is a disgrace, and a great violation of a great moral obligation to humanity. "Children anywhere in the world should be afforded protection,'' he said. Judge Mason sentenced Redden to an 18 month Community Corrections Order and a 12-month $2000 bond. He was also placed on the sex offenders registry for 15 years. But Braveheart spokeswoman Hetty Johnson said the sentence didn't sent the right message to the community. "This sentence is an insult to the efforts of protecting children from these offenders. It is in no way appropriate,'' she said. "The message it sends is that watching children being sexually exploited is no big deal. This is a complete fallacy. "For each offender who watches this stuff, more and more children performing more and more hideous acts of child cruelty must be created.'' http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/true-crime-scene/teacher-who-collected-child-pornography-avoids-a-prison-sentence/story-fnat7dhc-1226359195194

"Paedophile little hope of reform" (21-2-2013) Paedophile Jayme Regulski will serve three years in the juvenile justice system, with a judge telling him he would never again avoid adult jail. Judge Marilyn Harbison told Regulski, 20, in the County Court at Wodonga yesterday he was a clear danger to the community, and urgently needed treatment, although she had doubts about his ability to reform. Regulski pleaded guilty to two Commonwealth counts of causing child pornography material to be sent to him over a carriage service and one Victorian count of possessing child pornography. Regulski had begun to procure pictures of naked boys even while awaiting sentence by Ms Harbison on other sex charges in 2011. He carried out the crimes from his Wodonga home against a boy, 14, in Queensland and a West Australian boy, who was soon to turn 11. One Commonwealth charge related to incidents between August 14 and September 17, 2011, and the other between July 7 and August 26 last year. The Queensland boy was lured by Regulskis false Facebook profile in early 2011. A stream of messages flowed between the pair before Regulski asked the boy for naked photos of himself. Regulski did not hide his identity from the boy, 10, in Western Australia, who he met while playing games online. He harassed the boy to send photos of himself in his underwear, and then naked, promising he would give him credits to play games online. The offences took place while Regulski was awaiting sentence by Judge Harbison on other child sex matters from September and October, 2010. Eighteen months ago I sat here and you sat there in the dock, she told him yesterday. You are very lucky you are of an age when this disposition in a juvenile facility is available to you. You will not be offered such a lenient disposition again. Judge Harbison urged him to engage in treatment and said any unsuitable behaviour in custody could result in him being sent to an adult jail. At a young age, you have a significant history of sexual offences, she told him. There is no alternative for you but to change. http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1316083/paedophile-little-hope-of-reform/

News (9-8-2011)- "Man jailed by Victorian County Court for raping disabled sisters"- A man who sexually assaulted two intellectually disabled sisters and downloaded images onto his computer has been jailed. Stanley Rhode, 58, assaulted the women, aged 33 and 36, in 2009. He was jailed today for at least four years and three months. He also photographed one of his victims and downloaded the images onto his computer. A Victorian County Court jury found him guilty on two counts of rape and five counts of indecent assault. The court heard Rhode admitted to police he took advantage of one of the women, but claimed the encounters were consensual despite knowing the women were intellectually impaired. One of the women later said she was scared and had asked Rhode to stop, while the other said his actions made her feel "bad". In sentencing, Judge Tim Wood said Rhode's offending was serious as neither of the women were capable of giving informed consent. "You took advantage ... and breached the trust that these naive complainants placed in you," he said. The court heard Rhode was previously of good character and ashamed of the disgrace he had brought his family. His defence counsel had submitted Rhode was remorseful for the crimes, which were out of character, and he was unlikely to reoffend. Since being in jail he had found faith and was attending weekly church services. Rhode has been jailed for six-and-a-half years and will serve a minimum four years and three months. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/man-jailed-by-victorian-county-court-for-raping-disabled-sisters/story-e6frf7jo-1226111818524

Pleaded guilty to 14 offences. Released from jail in Oct 2004. Victims were 9 girls (10-16 yrs old). Originally charged with 52 offences against 11 victims.  "Convicted pedophile Gary John Riddle goes to school ball" (4-9-2009) Convicted pedophile Gary John Riddle attended a teenage debutante ball at the weekend, outraging parents from Geelong's Christian College and crime-victim advocates. People from the close-knit private school were horrified on Saturday night to see the registered sex offender seated at a table with his brother school principal Daryl and extended family just metres from teenage girls, the Geelong Advertiser reports. Crime-victim advocates were also shocked at the bad taste shown by the school, calling for an investigation into how a convicted sexual predator was allowed into the year 11 event at the Arena. Parents are now questioning whether the school breached its duty of care to the students. Gary Riddle was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault against nine girls aged eight to 16, between 1971 and 1989, and was sentenced to five years in prison in 2002. The assaults took place in his role as a primary school teacher, sports coach and church youth group leader. In sentencing, Justice Alex Chernov said his actions were predatory. The school yesterday confirmed Gary Riddle was seated at the event with wife Janine, a teacher at Christian College junior school, Daryl's wife Debbie, also a teacher at the junior school, his brother Stephen Riddle, who is principal of the junior school and his wife Heather, an administration assistant at the school's middle school campus. http://www.news.com.au/national/convicted-pedophile-gary-john-riddle-goes-to-school-ball/story-e6frfkvr-1225769438446|/images/g_riddle1.jpg

Had served 560 days in pre-sentence custody. Update - Queensland Court of Appeal found Riseley's prison sentence was "manifestly excessive", and removed the serious violent offence declaration. The court ruled Riseley would only have to serve 3.5 yrs jail before becoming eligible for parole, meaning he could be out in May 2011.|Pleaded guilty in 2009, to the manslaughter of a 19 day old baby boy, on November 10, 2007. http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/baby-shaker-has-prison-sentence-cut-20090922-fzhb.html News (23-9-2009)- "Baby killer's sentence cut" Queensland's Court of Appeal has reduced the sentence imposed on a Brisbane man for the manslaughter of a 19-day-old baby boy. In 2007, Matthew Andrew Riseley, 22, killed Isaac Lazarus, the child of a woman that Riseley was living with at the time. The boy suffered multiple fractures and bruising consistent with being bashed and violently shaken. In May this year, Riseley was sentenced in the Supreme Court to eight years in jail and declared a serious violent offender. The Attorney-General appealed against the sentence, arguing anything less than 10 years was inadequate. But the Court of Appeal today said it was hard to justify a sentence more severe than penalties imposed in previous cases. The Court removed the serious violent offender declaration and fixed Riseley's parole eligibility date to 2011. But the Queensland Opposition says community expectations have not been met with the sentence reduction. Deputy Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg says tougher sentencing laws are needed. "I don't necessarily blame the courts - I blame the Government for actually laying down very weak sentencing laws in Queensland and not providing the guidance necessary for the courts when it comes to sentencing tragic cases like this," he said. "It's not all that difficult to do and it doesn't mean that you're going in and interfering with the business of the courts in the court room. "All it simply means is that the Parliament reflects the community's concerns about what is acceptable and what isn't acceptable in sentencing." Acting Premier Paul Lucas says he is shocked by a court's decision to reduce the sentence. Mr Lucas says the decision was unexpected given the violent nature of the crime. "I am very shocked by this decision - I've spoken to the Attorney-General about it," he said. "Clearly we need to understand what went wrong here - whether there needs to be further changes to the law to deal with this matter. "But we need to understand this the courts are independent of government." http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-09-22/baby-killers-sentence-cut/1437588 News (26-5-2009)- "Matthew Riseley jailed for shaking baby" A father-of-four killed his girlfriend's newborn son by shaking him so hard it caused his brain to haemorrhage, a court has been told. Matthew Andrew Riseley, 22, was today jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of 19-day-old Isaac James Lazarus on November 10, 2007. Prosecutor Vicki Loury told the Supreme Court in Brisbane Riseley had caused the baby a "constellation of injuries'' when he squeezed his chest and shook him repeatedly. She said Isaac suffered haemorrhaging in his brain, retinas and optic nerves, severe bruising on his neck, and one of his ribs had been cracked. The baby also had a fractured leg caused by his limbs flailing while being shaken. The court was told Isaac also had two skull fractures which were consistent with being hit with severe force. Ms Loury said Riseley had attacked the baby while the mother lay sleeping in the next room at her home in Loganlea, south of Brisbane. When the mother woke the next morning she noticed Isaac was pale and gasping for air. He was taken to hospital but died of a severe brain injury later that day. The court was told Riseley repeatedly changed his story about what had occurred, saying he had dropped Isaac on a concrete floor or that he had fallen with him into a cabinet. He eventually admitted to police that he had squeezed him out of frustration and sleep deprivation. The court was told there was no evidence Isaac had been crying excessively at the time of the attack. Isaac's family filled the courtroom to hear the fate of his attacker, and sobbed as details of his injuries were read out. Justice Margaret Wilson said it was a "brutal assault on a helpless baby'', and declared it a serious violent offence. Riseley, from Logan, must now serve 80 per cent of his sentence before being eligible for parole. He has already served 560 days in pre-sentence custody. http://www.news.com.au/national/matthew-riseley-jailed-for-shaking-baby/story-e6frfkvr-1225716462561#ixzz1xY9X2JZN

DARREN GREGORY ROLLS (VIC- Pakenham)|40 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced Feb 2010, in the Vic County Court,to 6 yrs and 9 months jail - 4 yrs and 9 months non parole.|Darren Rolls, 38, pleaded guilty to 6 counts of performing an indecent act in the presence of a child under 16, and to loitering in the vicinity of children while a registered sex offender. When Police arrested Rolls in Wantirna South, he was hiding behind bushes wearing a pink g-string and pink thongs, watching a young girl play basketball. Jailed in 2003 for similar offences. News (23-3-2010)- Meanwhile, a lingerie-clad serial flasher who exposed himself to school children in Mulgrave has been jailed after a two-year joint investigation by Knox and Monash detectives. Darren Gregory Rolls, 38, targeted schools, sporting events and parks across Melbournes eastern suburbs during 2007 and 2008, exposing himself on 23 occasions to children aged between eight and 15. This included exposing himself to two children near Brandon Park Primary School on February 7, 2008. He was jailed last month for six years and nine months, with a minimum of four years and nine months. Rolls pleaded guilty to six counts of performing an indecent act in the presence of a child under 16 and to loitering in the vicinity of children while a registered sex offender. His conviction came after a two-year investigation by the Knox Crime Investigation Unit (CIU) to catch the Pakenham man, supported by Glen Waverley, Nunawading and Dandenong CIUs. Knox detective Sen-Sgt Neil White said Rolls was arrested in June 2008 after parents at a Rowville under-age soccer game recognised him and phoned police with his car numberplate details. Its another good example of someone being caught by observation and just shows that parents still have to be on their guard when at events with their children, Sen-Sgt White said. Its a big relief to have someone like that off the street when you dont know what they are capable of, or what their next intention is in seeking their own gratification. Sen-Sgt White said when officers arrested Rolls in Wantirna South he was wearing a pink g-string and pink thongs, watching a young girl play basketball. Victim impact statements read out during Rollss trial highlighted how he had disturbed the children he targeted. It does traumatise them and have a marked impact on them, Sen-Sgt White said. Victorian County Court Judge John Smallwood said Rollss prior history, which dates back to 1993 and saw him jailed in 2003 for similar offences, was disturbing. http://leader-news.whereilive.com.au/news/story/prison-for-predator-of-oakleigh-huntingdale-children/ News (10-3-2010)- "Knox police effort nabs flasher"- http://berwick-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/knox-police-effort-nabs-flasher/
PHILIP ROLLS (VIC- Melbourne)|54 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Philip Rolls/ Convicted sex offender..Tennis coach- Banned from working with children until 2016. News (3-7-2012)- "Sex offender free after stealing sportswear" Convicted sex offender Philip Rolls looked like he had come straight from a tennis court. Rolls, who claims to be one of Melbourne's most popular tennis coaches, was wearing a blue tracksuit and bright orange tennis shoes when he faced County Court judge Barbara Cotterell yesterday. Rolls, 54, is listed on the state's sex offenders register and is banned from working with children until 2016. He appeared in the County Court for breaching a suspended jail sentence he received in 2008 when caught loitering near Croydon Secondary College. Prosecutor Andrew Halse said Rolls was given a two-month jail term, wholly suspended for 24 months, after he was found at the school ''with no pants on''. Rolls had breached the conditions when caught stealing more than $9000 worth of tennis equipment from Diadora while working at the sportswear company's Hawthorn warehouse between 2009 and 2010. When interviewed by police in February, 2010, Rolls admitted he was coaching tennis but claimed his clients were not children. He said Diadora had been sponsoring him to wear their clothes because he was such a well-known tennis coach. Defence lawyer Nadia Kaddeche said tennis was Rolls' life but he had turned his life around since being placed on the state's sex offenders register. Judge Cotterell convicted Rolls on the theft charges and jailed him for five months, wholly suspended for 12 months. She said if there was ever a time Rolls was going to straighten himself up, it was now. Rolls was initially convicted for wilful and obscene exposure following an incident with a teenage girl at a Moorabbin tennis club. He was placed on the sex offenders register and banned from working with children on May 17, 2007, after he was caught loitering near Croydon Secondary College. He was placed under police surveillance in August 2007 after a tip-off that he was coaching children as young as six. Tennis Australia was notified two days later. It turned out he was teaching children tennis at clubs in Croydon East, Warburton, Canterbury, Blackburn and Noble Park. Rolls was arrested on August 30, 2007, and charged with engaging in child-related employment when a convicted sex offender. http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/sex-offender-free-after-stealing-sportswear-20120702-21deu.html
ANTHONY ROMA (VIC- Sunbury)|53 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in July 2012, in the Victorian County Court, to 3 yrs and 4 months jail - 2 yrs and 3 months non parole.|Anthony Roma - pleaded guilty to offences including 7 counts of indecent assault, 2 charges of assault, 3 counts of indecent acts with a child, and supplying valium to a child. News (19-7-2012)- "Vic child attacker gets 40 months' jail" A Melbourne man who indecently assaulted girls as young as 12 and a psychiatric patient who had been the victim of a previous sex attack has been jailed for three years and four months. Anthony Roma, 53, of Sunbury, pleaded guilty to indecent acts against three girls aged between 12 and 17. He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting a mentally ill sexual assault victim while he was a voluntary patient at a psychiatric unit in a Melbourne hospital. In the Victorian County Court on Thursday, Judge Jane Patrick said Roma's offending was brazen and disgusting, taking advantage of young girls in vulnerable positions. The offending began in 1996 when he attacked a 12-year-old girl. It continued in 2010 and 2011 when he repeatedly touched and kissed two teenage girls, sometimes while they were drunk. Following his arrest for those offences, Roma was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric unit at a Melbourne hospital where he repeatedly indecently assaulted another patient. Roma pleaded guilty to several charges, including seven counts of indecent assault, two charges of assault, three counts of indecent acts with a child, and supplying valium to a child. Judge Patrick said he lacked remorse, empathy and insight into his offending. "It's clear that your actions have caused great distress and harm to the victims," she said. "I accept that you were not going out into the world looking for victims but it is my view that you deliberately set out engaging in activities with young women in order to prey on them in a sexual way." Roma will spend a minimum two years and three months in jail and will report as a serious sex offender for life. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/breaking-news/vic-child-attacker-gets-40-months-jail/story-e6frea7l-1226429982027

Six months' jail for child porn viewer (4-5-2012) A George Town man who viewed tens of thousands of child pornography images and stories has been jailed for six months. Kevin Charles Rose, 46, pleaded guilty yesterday to two counts of using a carriage service to access child exploitation material and one count of possessing child exploitation material. Rose looked at child porn for about an hour a day for three years before police searched his home on December 20, 2011. He used the guest account on his laptop to access child porn, and opened 6248 websites in the two months before his arrest. Rose also downloaded a small selection of images and pornographic stories on to a USB stick every few days and viewed them several times before deleting them. Sentencing him in the Supreme Court in Launceston yesterday, Justice Peter Evans said the crime was serious because of the sheer volume of images Rose had viewed in the three years. "Largely because of the very substantial number of children who must have been exploited in the process of the creation of the many images accessed by the defendant, I consider that an immediately effective sentence of imprisonment is necessary," he said. Justice Evans said he did not believe Rose's claim that he was not sexually gratified by the child exploitation material. Rose will be placed on the sex offenders register for five years from his release from custody. http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/crime-and-law/six-months-jail-for-child-porn-viewer/2544916.aspx Child porn man pleads guilty (4-5-2012) Former George Town man Kevin Charles Rose spent an hour a day looking at child pornography before his arrest in December 2011, a Launceston court has heard. The 46-year-old pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court in Launceston yesterday to two counts of using a carriage service to access child exploitation material and one count of possessing child exploitation material. Rose, who now lives in North-West Tasmania, accessed child porn using a computer and then a laptop at his George Town home from December 20, 2008, to his arrest on December 20, 2011. He told police he saved ``about 4 per cent'' of the photos and explicit stories he viewed on to a USB drive every few days and looked at them a few times over a couple of days before deleting them. He downloaded the most recent batch the night before police searched his home. Crown prosecutor Elizabeth Curtis said based on Rose's admissions it could be conservatively estimated that he accessed 150 images each day and had accessed tens of thousands of child pornography images over three years.http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/general/child-porn-man-pleads-guilty/2544293.aspx

"My family betrayed: Father tells of his childrens agony over being abused by mate" (25-2-2011) The father of three of the victims, who cannot be named because of legal reasons, yesterday said the revelations of Ross offending had destroyed his family. Its ruined us ... the whole lot, he said. Who do we trust now? The kids are asking Is that it? Is that all he gets? The man said his family was struggling to overcome the offending. Its not good, he said. It was the ultimate act of betrayal by someone who I thought I knew. Judge Christopher ONeill said such offending was abhorrent and led to long-term damage to children and their families. He said the victim impact statements made chilling reading and highlighted the emotional damage caused. It is a serious aggravating feature that the victims were all children and aged between four and 15, Judge ONeill said. The father of the victims said he was disturbed by what he described as a lenient sentence. Hell be out in a little over three years and well still be struggling by what he has done, he said. God knows how much longer well be suffering ... well be living with this for the rest of our lives. Now its even worse because the justice system has let us down. Its not even a year per child that hes got left to serve. The father said Ross regularly visited the region on holiday after leaving the district about four years ago and had been living in Melbournes east. He said the offender was well known in the region, mainly through various sporting organisations, including Red Cliffs Football Club where his father Ian won McLeod Medals in 1955 and 1958. -Red More- http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/my-family-betrayed-father-tells-of-his-childrens-agony-over-being-abused-by-mate/2086654.aspx  "Melbourne man jailed for abusing children" (23-2-2011) A Melbourne man who "felt a thrill" during a 10-year sexual abuse of his friend's children has been jailed for six years.

NEIL MARTIN SACHMAN (WA- Perth)  |27 yrs old (2011) |Sentenced 4-4-2011, in the Perth District Court, to 6 yrs and 1 month in prison - eligible for parole after serving 4 yrs and 1 month, backdated to July 25 last year 2010 when taken into custody. |Neil Sachman sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl, after pulling her into bushes near a railway station in Greenwood, in the city's north on 25-7-2010. Pleaded guilty to 1 count of deprivation of liberty- 3 counts of aggravated indecent assault-1 count of aggravated sexual penetration without consent. Also sentenced for stalking a woman between November 2008 and April 2009 and some driving offences/ breaching suspended sentence. News (6-4-2011)- A young father who was filmed stalking a 14-year-old girl on a Perth train before he dragged her into secluded bush in Greenwood and molested her has been jailed. Neil Martin Sachman was yesterday sentenced to six years and one month jail for the July 25 attack on the teenager, for stalking offences committed against a Busselton woman over several months in late 2008 and 2009 and for traffic matters. Security camera footage shows how Sachman stalked the girl, who had been shopping south of Perth, after he boarded a train at Bull Creek. Sachman was filmed following the teenager when she left the train at Greenwood station. The West Australian understands footage from a security camera at a Greenwood home shows how Sachman was so fixated on the girl that he was almost hit by a car he failed to notice as he was following her. The District Court was told he asked the girl for the time before putting his hand over her mouth and dragging her into secluded bushes south of the train station. He forced the girl to kiss him, fondled her breasts and sexually penetrated her before masturbating over her legs. "It was a frightening and demeaning experience for the young victim, who no longer feels able to travel on public transport by herself," Chief Judge Peter Martino said. "She's had difficulties with education and friendships. She has ongoing anxiety, anger and depression." Sachman was on bail for stalking offences in Busselton when he molested the girl. The court was told how Sachman made sexually explicit and threatening phone calls to a woman once described as a friend who owed him $200. "Your conduct caused considerable distress and anxiety to the victim, and has also had a long-standing impact upon her, causing anxiety and loss of confidence and restriction in her social and work activities," Chief Judge Martino said of the stalking matter. Sachman was also sentenced over a crash on South Street, Kardinya, when he was driving without a valid licence. Chief Judge Martino accepted that Sachman's guilty pleas showed a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. Sachman will be subject to lifetime restraining orders over his two victims. He will be eligible for parole after serving four years and one month of his sentence, backdated to July 25 last year when he was taken into custody. http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/9142718/child-molester-jailed-for-six-years/

ANTHONY SARACENO (VIC - Templestowe)|46 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in July 2013, in the Melbourne County Court, to 2 months jail - to be followed by a recognisance release order for three years. To be a registered sex offender for life.|Anthony Saraceno pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing and soliciting child pornography, using a carriage service to make child pornography available, and attempting to pervert the course of justice. "Jail for man who collected child pornography like swap cards" (26-7-2013) A Melbourne man who collected images of child pornography like they were stamps or swap cards has been jailed for two months. Anthony Saraceno, 46, deleted his collections from a laptop and loaded it up with innocuous data after police visited his Templestowe home last August. The former helicopter pilot even altered the computer's internal clock so programs would appear to be newly installed. County Court judge Marilyn Harbison said police located 887 "degrading and disturbing" images and 21 videos of young girls, aged between eight and 15 and engaged in erotic poses or sexual acts, through sophisticated recovery techniques. She said Saraceno's collecting, which included his posting "chilling" online messages in an effort to complete his disorganised and incomplete sets of images, "bordered on obsessive". Some images came from two now-defunct Ukranian companies that posed as modelling agencies and exploited more than 1500 girls. Judge Harbison said Saraceno did not appreciate that these children - the victims of his crime - "were forced to pose and degrade themselves in such a way for your enjoyment". "They are not avatars; they are real children who will most likely never recover from their ordeals," she said. Saraceno and other similar offenders were responsible for propping up "this despicable trade" by creating demand for the abhorrent images, the judge said. "To see young girls in titillating poses with their genitalia exposed should be revolting to every civilised person," she said. Saraceno pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing and soliciting child pornography, using a carriage service to make child pornography available, and attempting to pervert the course of justice. Australian Federal Police searched Saraceno's home after being tipped off by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, but could not locate the laptop that he handed in later that day in his attempt to destroy the evidence. Forensic psychologist Dr Patrick Newton likened Saraceno's addiction to child pornography - which had apparently strayed from adult pornography because of boredom and loneliness - to problem gambling. He said the man displayed candour and openness to sex-offender treatment. His parents and partner cried as he was sentenced to two months' immediate imprisonment, to be followed by a recognisance release order for three years. Saraceno will be a registered sex offender for life. http://www.news.com.au/national-news/victoria/jail-for-man-who-collected-child-pornography-like-swap-cards/story-fnii5sms-1226686542011

He was one of 16 men arrested after police raided 19 properties in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT..Schnull is a self-employed installer of video and sound equipment. "Melb man jailed for baby porn possession" (13-2-2013) A Melbourne man who downloaded 45,000 "abhorrent" images of children engaged in sexual acts has been jailed for at least 16 months. Bernd Schnull, 62, was jailed for 34 months in the Victorian County Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to accessing and possessing child porn. He had used peer-to-peer file sharing websites such as eMule to download 45,287 images and 1611 videos of child pornography, depicting victims aged between six months and 16 years old. Of those, nearly 200 images and 53 videos were considered to be in the worst category of child pornography. In sentencing Schnull, Judge Mark Gamble said some of the material showed child victims in situations where they would have felt pain, confusion and humiliation. "What was depicted was abhorrent," he said. Judge Gamble said he took into account Schnull's early guilty plea, previous good character, lack of prior convictions, good prospects of rehabilitation and the fact he had voluntarily sought professional help for his problem. The court heard Schnull gained no sexual arousal from the material, but did it out of boredom, claiming he was attracted to the novelty and driven by curiosity. He told police the images were like a "forbidden fruit", but he had no sexual attraction toward children and could not see himself performing those acts. Schnull, of Warranwood, will be released from jail after 16 months on a recognisance order which requires him to be of good behaviour for 18 months. http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/02/13/16/01/melb-man-jailed-for-baby-porn-possession "Man watched child porn for 'stress relief', court hears" (29-1-2013) A man caught with more than 45,000 images and 1600 videos of child pornography on his computer told police he had no sexual interest in children, a court heard today. Bernd Schnull, 62, of Warranwood, claimed watching child pornography helped to relieve his stress and anxiety over the problems he was having with his wife at home. Schnull would download the images in his study where you needed an access code to get into the room. He would come home from work and go straight on to his computer. Schnull pleaded guilty in the County Court on Tuesday to one count of accessing child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography involving children aged from six months to 16. He faces a maximum penalty of 15 years' jail. Prosecutor Samantha Holmes told the court Schnull had downloaded a total of 45,287 images and 1611 videos between August 8, 2011, and March 20, 2012. The police measure child pornography on a scale, with level five being the worst. Schnull had nearly 200 images in the level 5 category. Schnull was arrested during a joint state and federal police operation aimed at smashing a child pornography ring operating on Australia's eastern seaboard. He was one of 16 men arrested after police raided 19 properties in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT. But defence barrister Sandy Robertson said Schnull had been acting alone and did not take part in any chat rooms on child pornography or share any files. Mr Robertson said Schnull sought psychological treatment after his arrest to try to understand his offending. He said Schnull claimed to have stumbled across the child pornography and was "caught in a web of depraved vile images". Schnull knew what he was doing was illegal but watching child porn helped to ease his boredom at home and the lack of intimacy with his wife. Judge Mark Gamble, who briefly adjourned the plea hearing after being asked by the prosecutor to view a sample of 40 images taken from Schnull's computer, said sexual stimulation must have played a role in Schnull's offending. Judge Gamble said Schnull had gone to a great deal of trouble to download the images, including securing his study so others could not get in. Mr Robertson said it was difficult for Schnull to explain but he had been attracted by the novelty of the images and was driven by curiosity. Downloading thousands of images became a compulsive habit. Mr Robertson conceded there must have been an element of sexual stimulation for Schnull otherwise he wouldn't have bothered. Since undergoing therapy in August last year, Schnull, who had had little empathy for the victims, was now ashamed and remorseful and realised his actions had helped feed the market for child pornography. A psychological report indicated Schnull did not fit the profile of a repeat sexual offender and was unlikely to reoffend. In his letter of apology read to the court, Schnull said he felt revulsion for what he had done and realised he needed help. Ms Holmes said Schnull, a father of four, should be jailed for at least 18 months and placed on the sexual offenders register for 15 years given the seriousness of the offending and nature and amount of material seized. Judge Gamble will sentence Schnull on February 13. http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/man-watched-child-porn-for-stress-relief-court-hears-20130129-2dif9.html "Child porn ring accused face court" (24-3-2012) A 21-year-old university student and another Melbourne man have faced the Melbourne Magistrates Court, accused of being part of a child pornography ring smashed by police in a massive operation spanning four states and territories.

"Serial rapist's Afghan ethnicity no excuse, says judge" (12-4-2012) A Judge has today rejected an Afghan refugee's claim that he raped an intoxicated and vulnerable teenager because of cultural differences. Esmatullah Sharifi, 30, was appearing in the County Court for the second time in less than three years on a charge of rape and Judge Mark Dean said his background as a traumatised Muslim refugee was no excuse. The judge said a psychologist told the court Sharifi, who came to Australia in 2001 on a temporary protection visa, had "an unclear concept of what constitutes consent in sexual relationships'' in Australia. But the judge said Sharifi's background and flight from the Taliban in Afghanistan could not excuse an extreme act of violence. "You well knew the victim was not consenting to the act of sexual penetration you performed,'' Judge Dean said. Sentencing Sharifi for the rape of the 18-year-old woman, Judge Dean said that he had driven from his home in Tullamarine to Frankston looking for a victim. The woman was alone, intoxicated and sitting on the footpath near the 21st Century nightclub after she had a disagreement with her friends. Sharifi sat down beside her, started talking to her and offered to drive her to a hotel in Mornington where her friends had gone. Judge Dean said Sharifi drove in a different direction and the victim became concerned and texted her friends but he took her phone and found a dark street where he stopped. As she cried and asked if he planned to kill her Sharifi put his hand around her neck and forced her to remove her clothes before raping her. .

SCOTT THOMAS SHEPPARD (scott sheppard) (VIC - Geelong)|41 yrs old (2008)|To be updated.|Scott Thomas Sheppard - Convicted of possessing child pornography - April 2005. "Key drug figure in jail" (13-6-2008) A key player in a Geelong amphetamine ring was yesterday jailed for three-and-a-half years. Scott Thomas Sheppard, 41, of Geelong West, pleaded guilty in the County Court to two counts of trafficking a drug of dependence, and counts of possessing a drug of dependence and possessing proceeds of crime. In sentencing, Judge Geoffrey Chettle said Sheppard manufactured and supplied amphetamine to drug dealers between November 2006 and February 2007. He said police began investigating a sophisticated, Geelong-based drug ring in late 2006, targeting Sheppard after learning he had bought drug-making equipment on the internet. Police listening devices and intercepts on a mobile phone owned by Sheppard indicated he was trafficking drugs. In one conversation he agreed to buy 140 packets of pseudoephedrine tablets for $8000. During the investigation, one of Sheppard's key dealers sold two grams of amphetamine to undercover police in Geelong West in early 2007. Sheppard was also seen dealing drugs in the inner-city suburb, the court heard. Judge Chettle said investigators later raided a house in Martin St, Thomson, where Sheppard was found in a rear shed trying to destroy evidence, including glass vessels used to make amphetamine. Police then searched his Nichol St home in Geelong West, finding more drug paraphernalia and $4600 cash. He was arrested in March 2007, when found carrying foil packets of amphetamine for personal use. Judge Chettle said Sheppard "ran foul" of a Geelong motorcycle gang and was subjected to physical abuse and harassment after a court convicted him of possessing child pornography in April 2005. Sheppard was again jailed in December last year for firearm and drug crimes, for which he is serving a minimum six-month sentence. Judge Chettle said Sheppard had been in protective custody because of his child porn conviction, and also noted the man's troubled background. "You fail to appreciate the tragic consequences of drugs in the community these courts so often see," he said. Sheppard will serve a minimum of two years and three months for the drug crimes - .

News (18-3-2011)- "Child porn videos land man in court" Andrew Mark Sheppeard used his work computer to download more than a dozen videos of child pornography. His searches for adult pornography landed him in trouble when he started to uncover illegal videos. Sheppeard pleaded guilty yesterday in Maroochydore Magistrates Court to seven counts of using the Internet to access child pornography, a charge with a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail. The court heard Sheppeard first searched the words sex and porn to find adult videos. He noticed a lot of files included the acronym PTHC, which he began using to search for more videos. He said he did not know the acronym stood for pre teen hard core. Police raided the Sunshine Coast business Sheppeard worked for on September 11, 2009 and a forensic analyst found 14 videos of child pornography that had been deleted from his computer. Sheppeard said some videos were of children as young as five but as soon as he opened it he would delete it. Magistrate Bernadette Callaghan said Sheppeard's crime was serious and despicable. The fact that you've just accessed it (child pornography) through the Internet doesn't make it a victimless crime, Ms Callaghan said. Sheppeard was sentenced to nine months imprisonment with immediate release and placed on a two year good Behaviour bond. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2011/03/18/child-porn-downloads-land-coast-man-in-court/

Pleaded guilty to 54 charges committed between 1978 and 2007, including indecent assault, being an accessory to indecent assault, and 23 charges of buggery. Victims were boys aged between 10 and 15 yrs. "Notorious paedophile jailed" - (17-11-2011) One of the states most notorious paedophiles, who repeatedly raped boys as young as 10 before passing them on to other men, has been sentenced to at least 11 years in behind bars. John Thomas Shiel, a member of the infamous Robert "Dolly" Dunn paedophile ring, cunningly and systematically ensnared six young boys, building up trust with them and their families before sexually assaulting them. The court heard that Shiel, 62, targeted boys whose families were in financial difficulty or had suffered a recent tragedy, including three young brothers whose father was struggling to look after them because their mother had just died. He would approach them at suburban Sydney swimming pools or fetes, often using his existing victims to draw them in, and then shower them with gifts and activities that their families would never be able to afford, such as trips to theme parks and motorcycle speedways. Having cleverly won the trust of the victims and their families families Shiel would offer to look after them for a weekend, or take them away for a "holiday" at surfers paradise. During these trips he would rape the boys and then, as the months progressed, prostitute them to the other members of the paedophile ring, such as Robert "Dolly" Dunn and the Northbridge property developer Mitchell Fox, who has pleaded guilty to seven charges. The boys were instructed about how to behave around the other members of the ring, and to help Shiel ensnare other young victims that appealed to his tastes. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/notorious-paedophile-jailed-20111117-1nkvu.html News (13-10-2011) http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/pedophile-supplied-kids-to-dolly-dunn/story-e6frfku0-1226166116028

When working as a property supervisor at Bimbadeen College in Cootamundra in 1999, Siggs was publicly thanked by the Aboriginal Evangelical Fellowship for his hard work in one fellowship newsletter. He has lived and worked at Fitzroy Crossing, Warburton, Blackstone and Nyapari in South Australia..-read more below- "Convicted pedophile linked to minister's sister" (2-11-2006) A convicted pedophile who worked in numerous Aboriginal communities across central Australia lived at an outback station run by the sister of Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough. Police are investigating whether Geoffrey Kenneth Siggs, 61, was part of any organised pedophile rings that Mr Brough earlier this year claimed were operating throughout remote indigenous communities. Mr Brough has confirmed that Siggs had lived at Morapoi station, in the West Australian Goldfields, for three months in 2003. Morapoi is run by his sister, Carol, and her husband, Pastor Greg Stubbs. The Stubbses are committed Christians and are involved in numerous church groups, as was Siggs, the son of a missionary who grew up at Warburton in the Great Victorian Desert. Siggs was arrested three weeks ago at the remote Aboriginal outpost of Kiwirrkurra, where he was living with a couple and running the community store. He has since pleaded guilty to one child pornography charge and is now in custody. That charge relates to a laptop and computer disc seized from him in 2003, which contained 337 images of child pornography downloaded from the internet. Another two computers have been seized from Siggs but it may take police up to 18 months to download material from them. Kalgoorlie detective Simon Nichols said although police had not seen any pictures of Aboriginal children, they were not ruling out the possibility that Siggs had assaulted or photographed indigenous children. "During our interview with him, he said that if there were images of Aboriginal children on them (the seized computers), they would be in their natural state, sort of innocent pictures of kids," Detective Nichols said. "We'll just have to wait and see. We will not hesitate in laying further charges should that material be of interest to us when we see it." He said detectives had yet to uncover any evidence suggesting Siggs was part of an outback pedophile ring but would continue to examine all aspects of the case. Mr Brough told The Australian that Siggs had spent three months at the station three years ago. "Apparently this bloke was waiting to get a permit to get into the Central Desert and asked if he could stay. He was tied up with some sort of Bible college," Mr Brough said. "They (Greg and Carol Stubbs) bumped into him some time later in Warburton. They told me they had read something in the local paper about him. "I've never heard of him." Siggs has worked in various Aboriginal communities in Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and NSW. When working as a property supervisor at Bimbadeen College in Cootamundra in 1999, Siggs was publicly thanked by the Aboriginal Evangelical Fellowship for his hard work in one fellowship newsletter. He has lived and worked at Fitzroy Crossing, Warburton, Blackstone and Nyapari in South Australia. Siggs will remain in custody until he is sentenced in January. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/convicted-pedophile-linked-to-ministers-sister/story-e6frfkp9-1111112454667

GEORGE JAMES SIMPSON (QLD- Townsville)|64 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 8-5-2012, in the Townsville District Court, to 3 yrs jail - to serve 6 months/2.5 yrs suspended.|Found guilty in the Townsville District Court of 6 charges of indecent dealing with an intellectually impaired person under care, one of permitting an intellectually impaired person to indecent dealing and common assault. News (9-5-2012)- "Carer abuses position of trust"- A taxi driver who signed up to care for a severely disabled woman he just met before abusing her has been jailed, with the organisation that facilitated the arrangement admitting to "poor judgement". George James Simpson, 64, began a seven-month relationship with the 25-year-old woman, who has Asperger's syndrome, autism, epilepsy and an intellectual impairment in May 2006. Simpson met the woman when she ordered a cab outside Townsville Hospital on May 3, 2006 and she told him she had nowhere to go. He took the girl to the Disability Services Queensland department the following day, before signing an official agreement with Life Without Barriers to become her carer. He then moved her into his one-bedroom unit. Simpson was jailed after being found guilty in the Townsville District Court yesterday of six charges of indecent dealing with an intellectually impaired person under care, one of permitting an intellectually impaired person to indecent dealing and common assault. Life Without Barriers state director Scott Bray told the Bulletin the organisation exercised "poor judgement". "We sincerely regret the impact this has had on the woman involved," he said. Mr Bray said the organisation conducted personal history checks required by the Department of Child Safety at the time, including a criminal record check, all of which were cleared by the department. "Notwithstanding, it is clear that our policies and procedures were not properly implemented in this case and we deeply regret the impact of that poor practice," he said. "We sincerely apologise for our role in this matter." Judge Stuart Durward SC said he found the organisation's decision "pretty extraordinary" when sentencing the man.

MARK ANDREW SINCLAIR  (TAS- Formerly of Ravenswood)|35 yrs old (2010) |Sentenced in the Launceston Supreme Court on the 15-11-2002 to 9 yrs jail - 4.5 yrs non parole.|Convictions included rape/ aggravated sexual assault/ aggravated assault/ stealing. Attacked 3 women during a sexual assault rampage in Feb 2002. One victim had her head repeatedly smashed into the footpath. Update- News (17-11-2010)- "Rapist flown back to Launceston in handcuffs"- Convicted rapist Mark Andrew Sinclair was yesterday escorted through Launceston Airport in handcuffs after being extradited from South Australia. The former Ravenswood resident, 35, was accompanied by Launceston detectives Darren Turner and Jason Savage, who flew to Adelaide on Monday to pick up the gym instructor. Sinclair is alleged to have breached his parole by leaving Tasmania in March. He was released from prison in September last year after serving eight years for a rampage that saw him attack three women in less than three hours in February 2002. Then 27, he first grabbed a young woman and dragged her backwards through Yorktown Square, then attacked a 65-year-old woman at Newstead with a one-metre piece of wood, before raping a severely disabled woman, also at Newstead. In between the attacks he was discovered outside a girls' dormitory at the Scotch Oakburn College boarding house but fled after he was confronted. It is understood Sinclair's parole conditions banned him from leaving Tasmania and he allegedly did so despite being refused permission to move to South Australia. It is also understood he has a child in South Australia and had become a grandfather, which prompted his decision to leave. After walking Sinclair through Launceston Airport to a waiting police car yesterday, detective senior constables Turner and Savage confirmed Sinclair had not opposed extradition in an Adelaide court yesterday. "He understands he has done the wrong thing and appears to want to serve out the rest of his sentence so he can get on with his life," Detective Senior Constable Turner said. Sinclair will be released later next year. http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/crime-and-law/rapist-flown-back-to-launceston-in-handcuffs/1999155.aspx  http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/crime-and-law/infamous-launceston-rapist-to-be-extradited/1997993.aspx|/images/mark_sinclair_2.jpg

DARREN LEIGH SKIPSEY (QLD- Woombye)| |Served 9 yrs of a 10-yr jail sentence for repeatedly raping a female jogger in 2001.|Rapist. The judge described the 2001 sexual assault as "a callous and brutal" attack which was "disgusting and degrading". News (12-1-2012)- "Rapist 'stole' woman's security" She was sleeping on the top bunk inside an annex at a Mooloolaba caravan park her family had holidayed in for 40 years. The 25-year-old woke to a man touching her on the shoulder. She thought it was her father. When her eyes adjusted to the 4am light, she saw a stranger's "scary face" instead. Darren Leigh Skipsey placed a finger over his mouth and whispered "shhhhhh". The woman screamed, waking her boyfriend in the bottom bunk and her father inside the van. Skipsey, of Woombye, pleaded guilty in Maroochydore Magistrates Court yesterday to entering the premises with intent to steal money and assault on December 30. Police prosecutor Tanya Fitz Gerald said Skipsey had served nine years of a 10-year jail sentence for repeatedly raping a jogger in a "callous and brutal" attack in 2001. "The effect on the victim and that family was profound. It devastated her life," she said. Sergeant Fitz Gerald said the latest offences occurred six months after Skipsey's parole restrictions ended. She said the woman had visited the caravan park every one of her 25 years but had already changed her behaviour. "She's now not prepared to sleep in (the annex), she's now sleeping in the van. She is not even prepared to go to the toilet on her own. "In one night's incident, her whole life's changed. "Though the charge is enter to steal, (he) stole a lot more that night ... this woman's feeling of safety." Barrister David Crews said it was not a sexual offence and Skipsey should not be punished as if it was. He said his client went on a six-day bender and needed money. "He was in the annex looking for money," he said. "He didn't kiss her, he didn't touch her inappropriately, he touched her on the arm." Mr Crews said Skipsey accepted that he needed supervision after being thrown back into the community where there were many "temptations" like alcohol. "This is a slip-up because he was not properly reintegrated into the community," he said. Magistrate Bernadette Callaghan questioned whether better supervision and reintegration would have prevented another family suffering from this man's actions. Skipsey must serve three months of a nine-month jail term and two years of probation. Because he has already served 12 days, he will be released on parole on March 30. BRUTAL HISTORY- April 29, 2001 - A woman was on a 6am jog when she helped a "lost" Darren Skipsey with directions. He drove off and lay in wait down the road, pretending he had car trouble, before he put a knife to her throat. He took her to a Nambour home and raped her nine times. The woman thought she was going to die. The judge described it as "a callous and brutal" attack which was "disgusting and degrading". He declared Skipsey a serious violent offender who must serve 80% of a 10-year sentence. http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/story/2012/01/12/rapist-has-stolen-womans-security/

News (27-5-2010)- Police say they have laid another 156 child sex offence charges on a Bendigo man, in central Victoria, who is being held in custody. Michael Peter Smart, 35, is now facing 162 charges relating to the alleged assault of a girl aged under 16, over a two year period. He was initially charged with six offences earlier this year. Yesterday in the Bendigo Magistrates Court, he was remanded to reappear in court next month. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-05-27/man-faces-156-extra-child-sex-charges/843184 News (8-3-2010)- A BENDIGO man charged with serious child sex offences including making child pornography with a minor has failed in his bid to have his name suppressed. Michael Peter Smart, 34, was arrested last Thursday morning after police searched his East Bendigo home. He has since been charged with sexual penetration of a child under 16, making and producing child pornography, possessing child pornography, procuring a child to make child pornography and blackmail. Police allege the offences relate to the sexual assault of a young girl during the past five years. They say more charges are expected to be laid. We believe there are more victims out there who will come forward, a police spokesman said. In an out-of-court hearing before a bail justice on Thursday night, Smart, a former train conductor, was denied bail. He appeared via video-link in the Bendigo Magistrates Court yesterday morning. Smart was not required to enter a plea and no application for bail was made. During the brief hearing, defence lawyer Luke Docherty asked the court to grant a suppression order prohibiting the media from publishing his clients name and employment details. He said if made public it could bring undue stress and embarrassment to the victim as well as Smarts family. The prosecution opposed the suppression order. Leading Senior Constable Jeff Lavery said the public should be made aware of such court proceedings, particularly if there are other victims involved. Police may need the assistance of the media to track down further victims. The suppression order was not granted and Magistrate Richard Wright remanded Smart in custody. The 34-year-old is scheduled to return to court on May 26 for a committal mention hearing. Anyone with information on the case should contact Bendigo Police Station on 5448 1300, or Crime Stoppers in 1800 333 000.

WILLIAM JAMES SMILEY  (SA- Elizabeth North)|40 yrs old (2010)   |Sentenced to a 7 month jail term, but jail term suspended under what is known as a "Griffiths Remand".   |Pleaded guilty to 19 counts of engaging in indecent filming, and two counts of attempting to distribute indecent material. News (23-12-2010)- "Hidden camera photographed female shoppers in Rundle Mall"- A man who took "up-skirt" photos of Rundle Mall shoppers with a hidden camera has 12 months to prove he deserves a suspended sentence. William Smiley will not have to go to jail if he can show, by December 2011, he has changed his "dreadful" attitude toward women. Smiley, 40, of Elizabeth North, pleaded guilty to 19 counts of engaging in indecent filming, and two counts of attempting to distribute indecent material. In June, he took video and still images up the skirts of women in Rundle Mall. He stood next to his victims and put his bag on the ground - it contained a hidden camera. Smiley then attempted to sell the images online. Today Lisa Schutz, for Smiley, said her client "demonstrated a capacity to recognise" the wrongness of his actions, thanks to counselling. She said the case had parallels with the ongoing St Kilda nude footballers controversy. "My client has been charged under what are fairly new laws that don't appear to exist interstate," she said. "What the (football case) girl has done would be an offence in this jurisdiction." Jackie Young, prosecuting, said Smiley's victims would have been shamed had he sold the footage. "This was an affront to the modesty of the victims," she said. "Legislators in SA have been quite forward in recognising this." Magistrate Mary-Louise Hribal agreed. "Initially, your view was that you were not hurting anyone, but this was a dreadful invasion of privacy," she told Smiley. "Your attitude toward women was truly dreadful. "You now realise this crime is not victimless, that you invaded these women's privacy, and that it was totally unacceptable." She imposed a seven-month jail term, but suspended its activation under what is known as a "Griffiths Remand". The sentencing option gives offenders an opportunity to rehabilitate while living under strict bail conditions. Ms Hribal ordered Smiley undergo sex offender treatment and counselling and return to court in December 2011. "Should you engage fully and participate in the treatment programs, and there is no like offending during the remand, I'm likely to suspend your sentence," she said. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/hidden-camera-photographed-female-shoppers-in-rundle-mall/story-e6frea83-1225975456574|/images/william_james_smiley.jpg
ALAN JOHN SMITH (TAS)|yrs old |Sentenced to life in jail in 1976. Released from jail in December 2001.|Child Killer/ Paedophile. Smith sexually assaulted and murdered, 7 yr old Janine Cunningham in 1975. News (22-12-2001)- "Murdered woman's parents angered at release of killer"- The release from prison of a man who murdered a Tasmanian schoolgirl has been met with anger and disbelief by the victim's parents. The parents of murdered north-west schoolgirl Janine Cunningham were telephoned yesterday by the victims assistant unit and told Alan Smith has been released on parole. Smith was convicted of murdering Janine Cunningham in 1975. Late last year the parole board was given a petition with 6,800 signatures requesting Smith remain in custody. Janine's mother,says she does not know where Smith is now or where he will be living. "That's completely wrong," she said. "He knows where we live - why shouldn't we know where he is? "I think everybody should know."- http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200112/s446537.htm News (7-4-2000) Burnie parents Dorothy and Barry Cunningham last night presented a petition containing more than 6200 signatures to State Parliament in a bid to keep their daughter's killer behind bars. The couple sat in the House of Assembly public gallery as Attorney-General Peter Patmore accepted the petition calling for convicted murderer Alan John Smith to serve out his life sentence. Smith was sentenced to prison for the term of his natural life 26 years ago for the murder and sexual assault of seven-year-old Burnie girl Janine Cunningham. But Justice Pierre Slicer ruled in 1997 that Smith would be eligible for parole on December 4, 2000. Mrs Cunningham said that it was an important moment for her and her husband, but she was not confident about what would happen next. "I think his (Smith's) application for parole should be given the same consideration as he gave Janine when she cried out to her mother before he killed her,'' she said. "I think that if you're sent to jail for the term of your natural life, you should stay there and never come out. "We shouldn't have to be fighting after all these years to keep him in jail you shouldn't have to worry about it." Mr Patmore said that he expressed deep sympathy for the Cunninghams, saying that the petition would be forwarded to the Parole Board for consideration when Smith's case was heard in December. "I have no doubt that I would feel the same as you do now if it was my child,'' Mr Patmore said. Braddon Labor MHA Steve Kons said that he would pray that the Parole Board would take into account the community's expectations. "I believe the judiciary is out of touch with community expectations. They are not part of mainstream Australia, which expects community standards to be upheld," Mr Kons said. "I hope the Parole Board has the wisdom to keep Smith inside." http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/general/keep-childkiller-in-jail-mps-urged/1313508.aspx

Smith pleaded guilty to 16 charges in Ballarat Magistrates Court, including committing an indecent act with a child under 16 and seven counts of wilful and obscene exposure. Among the string of offences, on November 9 last year Smith approached a mother and young children in the Smythesdale Gardens and masturbated in their direction. He then went to a bus shelter on the Glenelg Highway, where he again exposed himself and masturbated, this time while facing passing traffic. Smith then returned to the gardens where he exposed himself to another mother, who was with three children under the age of four. After the woman told him to get dressed, Smith went away and returned completely naked and masturbating about five metres away from them. Later that day police intercepted Smith on the Glenelg Highway. When they searched his car they found several sex toys, condoms, lubricant, pornographic DVDs and a length of rope. During the police interview Smith admitted several other recent flashing incidents including at the McDonalds drive-through in Sturt Street, and at McDonalds and Blockbuster Video in Sebastopol. Crown Prosecutor Alex Patton also said that on an earlier occasion when Smith was staying at the Ararat Hotel, he sat down with a six-year-old girl and played her a pornographic movie on his portable DVD player. Following a delay in a Corrections assessment, defence lawyer Patrick Bourke urged the court to release his client, saying he had already spent more time in custody than he was likely to be sentenced too. It just ought to have been done, its a simple as that, Mr Bourke said. Magistrate Richard Pithouse said he too was frustrated by the delay Smith had endured. http://www.araratadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/serial-flasher-free-from-jail-after-pleading-guilty/2583648.aspx
PETER KEVIN SMITH (NSW- Newcastle)|25 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced May 2011, in the District Court, to 22 yrs jail - 16.5 yrs non parole.|Smith slit a 13 year old girl's throat before sexually assaulting her, at a Jesmond shopping centre on 17-10-2010. Pleaded guilty in Newcastle Local Court to attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault and armed robbery. News (17-2-2011)- "Offender sexually assaulted 13-year-old girl Slit throat: guilty plea"- A man who slit a 13-year-old girl's throat before sexually assaulting her at a Jesmond shopping centre pleaded guilty to attempted murder yesterday. When police informed Peter Kevin Smith of his victim's age, Smith replied: "Was she really only 13 . . .? That's f-Ed," a police statement said. The girl suffered a 12-centimetre cut to her throat, but was not expected to experience any long-term problems with the wound, the statement said. Smith, 25, whose address was given as both Maitland and Muswellbrook, pleaded guilty in Newcastle Local Court to attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault and armed robbery. He will face Newcastle District Court next week when a sentence date will be set. Several hours before he attacked the girl on October 17 last year, Smith held a knife to a woman's throat in the underground car park of Maitland District Leagues Club while she was getting her baby daughter out of a car. Smith approached her from behind and yanked her head back by pulling her hair. He did so with such force that she fell, a police statement said. She was able to run away with her daughter in a pram while Smith searched her car and stole her handbag. He then travelled to Stockland Shopping Centre, Jesmond, where he forced the 13-year-old girl to the back of a shop and slit her throat with a carving knife. He then groped her breasts and put his hand in her pants and sexually assaulted her. The girl told police she thought she was going to die. She was able to escape with blood pouring down her. Smith was arrested at Telarah train station at 12.15am on October 18. http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/offender-sexually-assaulted-13yearold-girl-slit-throat-guilty-plea/2078658.aspx News (19-10-2010)- "No bail in alleged knifing, sexual assault and robbery"- Within just nine minutes, a man is alleged to have attacked and tried to kill a teenage girl in a Jesmond shopping centre, sexually assaulting her before slashing her throat with a knife so badly it damaged her trachea. Court papers state that the 13-year-old victim was attacked at the Blue Gum Road centre between 5.11pm and 5.20pm on Sunday  less than seven hours after the same man is accused of threatening a woman with a knife while she was strapping her baby into a pram in a Maitland car park. The girl had surgery and remained in John Hunter Childrens Hospital last night, where her condition was not being released, although medical staff have told police the injuries to her throat had damaged her trachea and were millimetres from causing major damage. Peter Smith, a 25-year-old whose address was listed in court papers only as being at Maitland, faces six charges relating to the separate attacks including the attempted murder and aggravated sexual assault of the teenager. Barefoot and wearing plastic white overalls, Mr Smith spent less than three minutes in the dock of Maitland Local Court yesterday before being led away by Department of Corrective Services officers. He did not enter pleas nor apply for bail, which was formally refused by magistrate Ellen Skinner. Police allege Mr Smith approached a woman in the Maitland District Leagues Club car park as she was strapping her child in a pram on Sunday morning. He allegedly stole her handbag and attempted to drive off in her car before fleeing. He faces four charges including an attempted carjacking count, use or possess or attempt to threaten to use an offensive weapon and two dishonesty counts relating to stealing the handbag and trying to withdraw money using a stolen keycard. Mr Smith is then alleged to have attacked the girl later that day. He was arrested at Telarah railway station about 12.10am yesterday before being charged. He will face Newcastle Local Court on December 15. http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/no-bail-in-alleged-knifing-sexual-assault-and-robbery/1971850.aspx

Umpire on sex offenders' list- (13-7-2012) A GEELONG football umpire, found in possession of hundreds of images of child pornography, has been placed on the sex offenders register for eight years. Christian Sorensen, 26, pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates' Court yesterday to a single charge of possessing child pornography. Police prosecutor Leading Senior Constable David Vanderpol said that, on August 30 last year, police executed a search warrant on a Geelong property and seized computer equipment belonging to Sorensen. He said analysis of the equipment revealed 256 images and 80 movie titles containing children, some as young as four, involved in sexually explicit acts with adults. Sen-Constable Vanderpol said that, on September 2, 2011, Sorensen attended Geelong Police Station of his own volition and admitted downloading the images and movie files from a recognised child pornography site between April 19 and May 19, 2011. The prosecutor said police were alerted to Sorensen's activities as part of an extensive, ongoing investigation into child pornography. David Risstrom, for Sorensen, said his client had psychological issues which were now being addressed. Mr Risstrom said Sorensen, a local football umpire, had been working with kids for 11 years, but would no longer be able to do so. "He has now confined his umpiring to seniors and reserves games and hopes to continue working with adults," Mr Risstrom said. "He has no priors and no matters pending." Mr Risstrom asked the court to allow Sorensen to continue his psychiatric treatment through the imposition of a Community Corrections Order. Magistrate Stephen Myall said he accepted the contents of the psychiatric report. Sorensen was convicted and placed on a Community Corrections Order for 18 months and directed to undergo assessment and treatment for psychiatric issues and to reduce offending. He was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register for eight years and computer equipment seized by police was ordered forfeited to the Crown. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2012/07/13/337131_news.html|/images/christian_sorenson_2.jpg

COLIN JOHN SPARKES (TAS)|yrs old|To be updated.|Colin Sparkes, convicted of burglary with intent to rape. News (26-3-2012)- "Worst criminals able to reoffend"- SOME of Tasmania's worst criminals are reoffending after the court refuses to declare them dangerous criminals a classification that gives judges the power to jail them indefinitely. There are seven declared dangerous criminals in Tasmania, being mostly child abusers and serial rapists. Beyond Abuse spokesman Steve Fisher said it appeared either the Director of Public Prosecutions was not making enough dangerous prisoner applications to the court or the court was rejecting too many. The Supreme Court in 2003 refused a prosecution application to declare child sex abuser Anthony John Minney, of Launceston, a dangerous criminal, yet he was jailed last September for 14 months after pleading guilty to loitering near children. Minney has a long history of sexually assaulting children and last year asked police to send him to prison. In 2003 Justice Ewan Crawford said Minney's child sex abuse case was ``not sufficiently exceptional'' to justify making a dangerous criminal order. "Seven people (declared dangerous) across the whole of Tasmania does not seem to indicate they are using the tool at their disposal enough, '' Mr Fisher said. "The dangerous criminal register was brought in to serve a purpose and that's to do exactly that to keep them off the street.'' Late last year convicted serial rapist Kevin Richard Bell failed in his bid to have his dangerous criminal order overturned. Bell was sentenced to 12 years' jail in 1991 for six rapes, one indecent assault and four counts of defilement of a young girl. Six months after being paroled in 1998, he committed sex offences against children aged three and 16. Rocherlea man Brendan James Freeman was declared a dangerous criminal in 2004 and sentenced to seven years' jail after admitting to raping and bashing a woman in Launceston. Colin John Sparkes (1997) was also placed on the list after being convicted of burglary with intent to rape. Other criminals the DPP has applied to have placed on the dangerous criminal register include Ian John Brumby (2002) who had committed assault, robbery and rape, and serial rapist Paul Vincent Phillips (1998).http://www.theadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/worst-criminals-able-to-reoffend/2500119.aspx

BRIAN SPILLANE (NSW)|69 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 9 yrs jail - 5 yrs non parole/ will be eligible for parole in November 2015..full sentence to expire on November 29, 2019.|Brian Spillane - Former Catholic priest - Convicted of 8 charges of indecent assault on a female younger than 16, and one count of indecently assaulting a female aged 16 years or more.. The charges relate to abuses during the 1970s and 1980s when Spillane was a priest working in both Sydney and country areas of New South Wales. "Priest 'a violent bully and coward'" (20-4-2012) The former priest Brian Spillane has been sentenced to nine years' imprisonment for a series of sexual assaults on young girls - attacks described as "serious, planned and callous" by Judge Michael Finnane of the NSW District Court. "The offender used his position as a priest to gain access to the homes in which each of his victims lived," said the judge. "He was very trusted and the parents of each of the victims readily gave him access to their daughters because of that trust and the esteem in which he was held." The assaults began in the late 1970s when Spillane was on the staff of St Stanislaus College, a boys' boarding school in Bathurst. They continued when he became a parish priest in Sydney. He later returned to St Stanislaus as school chaplain. Spillane, 69, continues to deny all the charges that have been brought against him, not only those involving these young girls but some 100 charges he has yet to face relating to assaults on boys at the school. A heavy-set redhead, Spillane trained for the priesthood in the Vincentian Order and was sent to teach at St Stanislaus in the late 1960s. At his trial he described himself as a modern priest - joyful and enthusiastic, a hugger and kisser, a man at ease with families and their children. In the late 1970s, he ingratiated himself into a family with boys at the school and abused their sister, then aged 11. "This was the conduct of a violent bully and coward, done without regard to the effect it would have on the young girl," Judge Finnane said at sentencing. "It was sexual abuse carried out by a trusted priest, and was a major breach of trust." The Vincentians posted Spillane to Sydney in the late 1970s and for a time he was acting parish priest at St Anthony's Marsfield. There he befriended another devout Catholic family and, under the guise of hearing their daughters' bedtime prayers, abused both for more than a year. The judge called this: "Predatory and a major abuse of trust." One of those victims, known as Miss M, told the court of the devastating impact on her life of Spillane's abuse: of guilt, panic, mistrust, anger, depression, estrangement, drinking, drugs, loss of interest in study and, now, fearfulness for her daughter. She said: "It changed my fate and all that I wanted to be." In those years in Sydney, Spillane also assaulted and wrote love letters to a 16-year-old student at a western suburbs Catholic school. Judge Finnane called the assault "predatory and heartless" and the letters "maudlin, full of false piety and completely inappropriate". Spillane left the priesthood in 2004 and a son was born after his marriage that year. The first complaints about him were made to Bathurst police three years later. He was charged in 2008 and convicted by a District Court jury in 2010. Sentencing was delayed until yesterday by the defence solicitor Greg Walsh attempting to have his old friend Judge Finnane disqualify himself from this and any future proceedings involving Spillane. Mr Walsh claimed that after the swearing-in of a new District Court judge in March last year, Judge Finnane remarked over a cup of tea that paedophiles were "all guilty" and "should be put on an island and starved to death". Judge Finnane denied saying those words and declined to disqualify himself. The dispute reached the NSW Court of Appeal in November and the decision upholding the judge's right to sit was delivered a fortnight ago. The court found the words, if uttered, might have been incautious but couldn't be taken seriously and would not be regarded by a fair-minded bystander as prejudging the former priest's position. Lawyers estimate about $700,000 has been spent on the former priest's defence so far. But who is footing that bill is a mystery. A spokeswoman for the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Pell, says it is not the church. The Vincentian Order has refused to take the Herald's calls. At Spillane's sentencing, Judge Finnane spoke of receiving glowing testimonials to his good character. But, he added, "it has also to be said that he used his eminence in the community and his role as a priest to gain access to his victims and to carry out sexual offences on them." Miss M sobbed with relief when the judge sent her abuser to prison for nine years with a non-parole period of five. http://www.smh.com.au/national/priest-a-violent-bully-and-coward-20120419-1xa40.html "Priest jailed 5 years for sex assaults on young girls" (19-4-2012) A former Catholic priest has been jailed for at least five years for sexually abusing girls as young as eight. Brian Spillane, 69, was convicted today of eight charges of indecent assault on a female younger than 16 and one count of indecently assaulting a female aged 16 years or more. The charges relate to abuses during the 1970s and 1980s when Spillane was a priest working in both Sydney and country areas of New South Wales. In sentencing Spillane, Judge Michael Finnane called each assault "serious, planned and callous". He said Spillane's position as a priest and his "standing in the community" allowed him to gain access to the homes of his victims, many of whom came from devout Catholic families. Some of the offences occurred when Spillane was alone with his victims in their bedrooms for night-time prayers. One happened in a car after he'd said mass at a memorial service. "He was very trusted and the parents of each of the victims readily gave him access to their daughters because of that trust and the esteem in which he was held," Judge Finnane told Sydney's Downing Centre District Court. "The victims in this trial were all girls to whom he got access when he was conducting parish missions or ... when he was visiting a country town. "It was sexual abuse carried out by a trusted priest and was a major breach of trust." The judge said Spillane had shown no remorse and no contrition for his offending "which means that there can be little hope of rehabilitation". But he noted Spillane's age and said in all other respects the former priest had lived a "blameless life". Taking into account time already served, Spillane will be eligible for parole in November 2015. His sentence will expire on November 29, 2019. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/priest-jailed-5-years-for-sex-assaults-on-young-girls/story-fnat7dhc-1226333258489|/images/brian_spillane.jpg

MICHAEL JOHN STAM (Michael Stam) (SA- Christies Beach)|38 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced Feb 2013, in the Adelaide District Court, to 6 months jail - sentence suspended with conditions including he undergo counselling and be of good behaviour for 12 months.|Michael John Stam - Pleaded guilty to offences, including aggravated counts of accessing and possessing child pornography. "No jail for dialing-up child pornography on demo phones in Telstra shop" (28-2-2013) A man who used demonstration phones in a South Australian Telstra store to download child pornography - twice - has avoided an immediate prison term. District Court judge David Lovell said staff at the Noarlunga store had noticed Michael John Stam acting suspiciously while looking at sample phones in December 2011 "You were in the store for approximately 30 minutes and during this time you were observed by shop staff to be acting suspiciously while looking at demonstration phones," Judge Lovell said. "It was obvious to the staff that you did not want any attention because you would turn away from them when they approached you. You also were observed to be attempting to hide the phone with your hand." When Stam left the shop, staff checked the phones and discovered he had entered Google searches such as "nude naked boys". "They further discovered that you downloaded images of young children particularly an image of a young boy splashing in water and an image of a young female posing in a provocative manner," Judge Lovell said. Stam, 38, returned to the store in February 2011 and was recognised by staff, who called police. Police observed Stam accessing a black and white image of two young boys and arrested him. A search of Stam's home revealed another 18 images on mobile phones of nude children under the age of 14. The offences breached an earlier good behaviour bond for offences involving abusive and sexual phone messages to his former employer and wife. Judge Lovell said Stam had been diagnosed with listening and learning disabilities in school, where he was often bullied and teased. He said Stam was on a disability support pension and have never been involved in a relationship. "Although you admit what you did was inappropriate, you fail to understand why and this is of concern to the court," Judge Lovell said. "I have been told and accept that you are a vulnerable individual in the community and would even be more vulnerable in the prison environment. You would not cope well with the prison environment due to your lack of understanding of social behaviour." Judge Lovell sentenced Stam to six months' prison but suspended the sentence on conditions including he undergo counselling and be of good behaviour for 12 months. http://www.news.com.au/national-news/south-australia/no-jail-for-dialing-up-porn-in-telstra-shop/story-fndo4dzn-1226587698952 "Porn offender lacked awareness, court told" (12-2-2013) A court has been told a man lacked awareness why it was wrong to download child pornography and do so in a retail store. In the Adelaide District Court, Michael John Stam, 38, of Christies Beach pleaded guilty to offences, including aggravated counts of accessing and possessing child pornography. Prosecutors said Stam used a mobile phone in a Telstra shop to download the pornography, two years ago. Judge David Lovell expressed concern psychological assessments indicated Stam lacked insight into his offending. He feared the man might pose a community risk. "I don't think it's a case where a short custodial sentence will teach him a lesson, so to speak, that's the difficulty," the judge said. "The comforting thing for me and perhaps for the DPP is that, whilst he has been under supervision [on bail], there have been no allegations of further problems." Prosecutor Dominic Petraccaro agreed. "Yes, it's been two years and there has been no suggestion of him even attempting to access this sort of material again," he said. "In terms of accessing child pornography in the Telstra shop using their phone, he was always going to get caught." Stam's lawyer Oliver Koehn said his client could be at risk in prison. "He is a quite intellectually-disabled person who can mutter the right responses but when it comes down to it, doesn't understand," he told the court. "He is going to be a very vulnerable person in the prison environment and will be exposed to bullying and harassment to a degree that other prisoners wouldn't. "This man is not completely unaware that what he did was wrong. What he is unaware of is why it is wrong." The prosecution said any bond would require Stam was supervised to ensure he was rehabilitated. He will be sentenced in a fortnight. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-12/porn-offender-lacked-awareness-court-told/4514544?section=sa
DANIEL STANI-REGINALD (NSW)|21 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in May 2013, in the NSW Supreme Court, to 45 yrs jail - 30 yrs non parole..Eligible for release in 2041.|Daniel Stani-Reginald - Murderer/Rapist.. In March 2011 Stani-Reginald raped and then used a cord to strangle to death Tosha Thakkar, 24, a neighbour in the Croydon boarding house where he lived. "Body-bag murderer Daniel Stani-Reginald jailed for 45 years" (18-5-2013) Daniel Stani-Reginald would have cut an unassuming figure - a casually dressed teenager hailing a cab with a bulging suitcase trailing behind him. And while the driver was curious why the bag he helped hoist into the boot was so heavy, the chatty 19-year-old explained it was simply full of electronics equipment. The Supreme Court heard yesterday the dark suitcase really contained the body of a young woman, the victim of a remorseless killer who spent his spare time schooling himself on society's most violent and depraved criminals. Stani-Reginald, 21, smirked and yawned through his sentencing as Justice Derek Price ordered him to spend up to 45 years behind bars for the "extraordinarily cruel" murder. In March 2011, the teenager violently raped then used a cord to strangle Indian accounting student Tosha Thakkar, 24, a neighbour in their Croydon boarding house. He stuffed her body into the large suitcase, bought from Target a month earlier, and caught the taxi to Meadowbank, where he tossed the bag into a canal. "The last minutes of her life must have been horrifying - this was a terrible way for (her) to die," Justice Price said. When police combed through Stani-Reginald's computer they found nearly 10,000 website visits from searches including backpacker killer Ivan Milat, US cult leader Charles Manson and Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe. The day he bought the bag he pulled up an article on the 2007 murder of Sydney toddler Dean Shillingsworth, whose body was put in a suitcase and thrown in a duck pond. Justice Price said Stani-Reginald had shown "no capacity for empathy" and posed a high risk of committing serious sexual or violent crimes until his tendencies were "moderated naturally" in old age. Stani-Reginald showed no emotion as the judgement was handed down. Outside the court, Ms Thakkar's cousin Pritak said the victim was a "happy girl" whose mistake was to believe everyone was a good person. "We are disappointed with the sentence, we have lost Tosha forever ... so we were expecting a full, life sentence," he said. Mr Thakkar said it was impossible to describe the pain her parents were feeling after losing their only daughter. "They did not send her (to Australia) for this ... like everyone here, she wanted to be happy," he said. Stani-Reginald will be eligible for release in 2041. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/body-bag-murderer-daniel-stani-reginald-jailed-for-45-years/story-e6frg6n6-1226645646815 "Teenager who raped, murdered and stuffed Indian student in a suitcase sentenced to 30 years in jail" (17-5-2013) As a teenager, Daniel Stani-Reginald spent hours on the internet researching notorious serial killers and rapists. Today a judge sentenced the now 21-year-old to spend at least 30 years behind bars in their company for the vicious rape and murder of a young Indian student. Stani-Reginald periodically yawned and appeared to smirk this morning as Justice Derek Price told the Supreme Court his "terrible" crimes stopped short of deserving a life sentence. In March 2011, when he was aged only 19, Stani-Reginald raped and then used a cord to strangle to death Tosha Thakkar, 24, a neighbour in the Croydon boarding house where he lived. He then stuffed her body in a large suitcase he had bought from Target a month earlier and caught a taxi to Meadowbank, where he threw the bag in a canal. Workmen discovered Ms Thakkars corpse two days later and Stani-Reginald was arrested for the murder. When police searched his laptop they found nearly 10,000 links to articles and websites he accessed over the past four months, including searches on Charles Manson and Australian teen killer Matthew Milat. One newspaper article he viewed on the day he purchased the bag featured details on the 2007 murder of Sydney toddler Dean Shillingsworth, whose body was hidden in a suitcase and tossed in a duck pond. The morning of Ms Thakkar's murder her killer had searched for "choke hold" and also viewed pornography. Prosecutors had asked for Stani-Reginald to be handed a life sentence, arguing he had clearly decided to ``school himself as a serial rapist and killer. Justice Price said the 21-year-old's strangulation of Ms Thakkar was "extraordinarily cruel" and he had shown no remorse, empathy or contrition for the pain he had inflicted. "The last moments of her life must have been horrifying - this was a terrible way for (her) to die," he said. But Justice Price said while Stani-Reginald's crimes were the worst imaginable of their types, he couldn't be sure he had planned to become a repeat murderer or sexual predator. He said there remained a high chance the killer would commit more crimes, but he didn't deserve to spend the rest of his young life in jail. "I am satisfied that there is a real risk that the offender will re-offend by committing serious offences of violence or sexual assault ... I do not make this finding lightly," he said. Stani-Reginald didn't react as he was sentenced to 45 years - with a minimum of 30 years - in prison. He will first be eligible for release in 2041. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/teenager-who-raped-murdered-and-stuffed-indian-student-in-a-suitcase-sentenced-to-30-years-in-jail/story-fni0cx4q-1226645128219 http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/05/17/11/26/man-gets-30-years-for-student-rape-murder http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/04/29/12/28/sydney-murderer-killed-our-life-parents http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/parents-anguish-murdered-daughter-was-their-sweet-little-fairy-20130429-2invw.html http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/420204/neighbour-admits-to-murdering-student/|/images/daniel-stani-reginald-2.jpg
CRAIG STANLEY (VIC- Langwarrin)|28 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 4-7-2012, in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court, to 20 months jail - 10 months non-parole.|Craig Stanley..A raid on his Langwarrin home in outer Melbourne uncovered more than 17,000 child porn images.. Pleaded guilty to possessing child porn images, to making child porn images and transmitting 3 images.. Co-offender Rebecca Michels. News (4-7-2012)- "Fugitive couple sentenced after pleading guilty to child porn" A fugitive couple who spent 21 days on the run after police raided their home last year have been sentenced after pleading guilty to child pornography charges. Craig Stanley, 28, and Rebecca Michels, 25, were arrested in Dimboola in November after a three-week police hunt for the pair. The couple fled after a police raid of their home sparked by a tip off from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. At the Melbourne Magistrates' Court today Stanley was sentenced to 20 months in prison with a non-parole period of 10 months. Michels was placed on an 18-month community corrections order. It was alleged in court more than 80,000 pornographic images were uncovered during the raids. Of them more than 17,000 images and 531 videos depicting child pornography, including children as young as one-year-old, were found. Prosecutor Anne Hassan told the court some images showed Michels posing naked and semi-naked with a 10-year-old girl. The court heard Michels appeared naked alongside the girl in 10 images. Ms Hassan said it was believed the girl was as young as seven when the first naked photos of her were taken in 2009. It was alleged the girl's father and stepmother were also naked in some of the 279 images that were taken over a two-year period and showed close-up shots of the girl's genitals. The court heard the couples were nudists who met at a public pool. As a result of police inquiries the other couple are also facing charges. Michels, who is on bail, pleaded guilty to one count of making child porn. Her parents walked out of court as details of the charges were read out. Stanley, who is in custody, pleaded guilty to three charges including making, possessing and transmitting child porn. Other charges against the pair were dropped. Ms Hassan said the young girl told police Stanley and Michels were her "aunty and uncle'' and that her dad "doesn't do anything to hurt me''. She said the girl, who appeared "distressed'' during a police interview, was a "deeply exploitive child''. The court heard the girl was involved in a series of photo "sessions'' with one allegedly lasting up to five hours. Images depicting the girl were all deemed to be in a low category of child pornography, the court heard. But some images downloaded by Stanley included sadism and bestiality, it was alleged. Jim Dounias, for Stanley, said his client had been "immersed in pornography'' since the age of 13. "We don't blame Ms Michels for anything, we take full responsibility for everything,'' he said. Mr Dounias said while more than 17,000 images of child pornography were allegedly found on Stanley's computer, he had not viewed all the content. But Magistrate Jack Vandersteen questioned why it had been downloaded at all. "How do you download stuff and not look at it and not know what you're doing?'' he said. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/fugitive-couple-sentenced-after-pleading-guilty-to-child-porn/story-e6frea6u-1226416791640 News (4-7-2012)- "Fugitive couple Craig Stanley and Rebecca Michels admit making child pornography" A former soldier who went on the run after police found thousands of depraved child porn images at his Melbourne home, including one of a baby being sexually abused, has pleaded guilty. Craig Stanley, 28, fled in October with his partner Rebecca Michels, 25, after a raid on their Langwarrin home in outer Melbourne led to the discovery of more than 17,000 child porn images. Police also found 279 images that Stanley had made involving a girl the couple met through being nudists, the Melbourne Magistrates Court was told on Wednesday. Michels has admitted making 10 images involving the same girl. Stanley has pleaded guilty to possessing 17,381 child porn images, to making child porn images and transmitting three images. Michels has admitted making child porn. Defence lawyer Jim Dounias said Stanley, a former soldier, was a nudist who had crossed the line and taken indecent photos of a girl. Magistrate Jack Vandersteen said there must have been an element of trust that was built up in the child before she participated in the photos. Mr Dounias said Stanley would be a registered sexual offender for life which would limit his work opportunities. Prosecutor Anne Hassan said the fact the identities of the children in the 17,381 images Stanley possessed were not known did not mean they were not victims. "These are real victims, real children," she said. Ms Hassan told the court among the 17,381 images found on electronic devices belonging to Stanley was one of a one-year-old baby being sexually abused. Michels will be assessed for a community corrections order, the court heard. Michels and Stanley fled to a remote bush campsite in Victoria, surviving on carp and baked beans and avoiding capture for 21 days until Michels tipped police off, a court previously heard. They were arrested in the Dimboola area in north-western Victoria. They are expected to be sentenced later on Wednesday. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/fugitive-couple-craig-stanley-and-rebecca-michels-admit-making-child-pornography/story-fncz7kyc-1226416954434|/images/craig_stanley_2.jpg
GREGORY MARK STAROW (Gregory Starow) (Victoria - St Kilda)|51 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced 6-7-1999, in the Melbourne Magistrates Court, to a 12 month community based order - 150 hours of unpaid community work - ordered to attend a sexual offender program.|Gregory Mark Starow - Pleaded guilty to possessing computer images depicting children in an indecent sexual manner.. Investigators found 24,342 files on his home computer, most of which contained images of young children in sexually explicit poses, during a raid on his home on 28 October 1998..Starow admitted that he was part of a paedophile group whose members had to possess a minimum of 10,000 pornographic pictures of children before they could join. "Child sex images checked abuse: claim" (7-7-1999) A computer systems analyst, who was part of a worldwide Internet paedophile group, claimed he used thousands of images of child pornography as a way of avoiding molesting children, the Melbourne Magistrates Court was told yesterday. The court heard that Gregory Mark Starow, 37, had claimed that the photos were his sexual release and the Internet was ``keeping him off the streets". Police said that Starow, from St Kilda, had admitted he was part of a paedophile group called Wonderland, whose members had to possess a minimum of 10,000 pornographic pictures before they could join. The court heard that Starow, who pleaded guilty to possessing computer images depicting children in an indecent sexual manner, was attracted to girls aged between three and 10. Senior Constable Craig Atkinson, prosecuting, said investigators found 24,342 files on his home computer, most of which contained images of young children in sexually explicit poses, during a raid on his home on 28 October last year. Senior Constable Atkinson said Starow was the longest-serving member of Wonderland, using the name ``Jenny" and the nicknames ``Jenny Mey" and ``Wantmore". Mr Michael McNamara, defending, said Starow, who had cooperated with police, had not created or sold the material and had not been in trouble before. A report by a psychologist, Mr Bernard Healy, said that Starow was unable to see beyond the crime and believed there were no victims. The magistrate, Mr Phillip Rodda, said Mr Healy reported that Starow would discourage others from physically abusing children and that he asserted he was a paedophile, not a child abuser. Starow was convicted and put on a community-based order for 12 months and was ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work. He was also ordered to attend a sexual offender program. http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au

ABRAHAM STEPHANOPOULOS (VIC- Armadale - Possibly in  Portland)|36 yrs old|Sentenced to 5 mths jail/ suspended for 15 mths/ fined $5000.|Doctor. Pleaded guilty in the Dandenong Magistrates Court in July 2005 to 3 counts of knowingly possessing child pornography. Caught with 1400 child pornography images of children aged between 8-14 yrs. We have received unconfirmed reports that he may be living in Portland-Victoia, and working at a Portland Medical centre under the name "Abraham Stephenson". News- "GP downloading child porn given second chance"- Is there any circumstance in which someone convicted of child sex offences can safely practise medicine? Yes, according to a panel of the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria. Dr Abraham Stephanopoulos was a young neurosurgery registrar at the Monash Medical Centre in 2003 when he was caught downloading child pornography on to a computer used by the hospitals registrars. The police seized his home computer and some discs, which also contained a large amount of pornography, including child pornography. In July 2005, Dr Stephanopoulos was convicted in the Dandenong Magistrates Court of three counts of knowingly possessing child pornography. He was sentenced to five months in jail, wholly suspended for 15 months. Dr Stephanopouloss medical registration had been suspended since November 2004 while the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria investigated his conduct. On 16 August 2006, the panel reached its decision. It would be only in rare circumstance that a panel of this board would contemplate permitting a medical practitioner convicted of possession of child pornography to return to practice, the panel wrote in its reason for its decision. Ultimately, it has concluded in this particular case that such circumstances have been established. The young doctors treating psychiatrist and psychologist had testified he was not a paedophile and was at low risk of reoffending. Downloading pornography was a manifestation of anxiety and stress. Dr Stephanopoulos was reprimanded for bringing discredit on the profession. The panel suspended him until March 2007, when his suspended criminal sentence expired. Conditions were also placed on his registration; he cant treat anyone under 18 until 2015 and must provide regular proof he is seeing his psychiatrist for another eight years. It is a reality that many young professionals make serious errors in judgment at some stage, the panel determined. This in itself does nor render them inappropriate for continuing membership of their profession. http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/42/0c05a042.asp|/images/abraham_stephanopoulos_1.jpg

"Victim was a 4 yr old girl". Stevenson is currently living within close proximity to Ballajura Primary school and Ballajura day care centre. The girls father has rightly called the sentence pathetic...the current court system is letting down the victims/ victims families. Harsh lengthy jail sentences/ Deterrents are needed. It is also of major concern that these so called sex offender sessions are held secretly in the community and not in jail where it should be. They get to meet/ mix with other paedophiles in the community... this is obviousily placing you and your children at risk as sex offenders especially paedophiles are highly likely to re-offend.
ANDREW MARK STEWART (NSW- Clarenza)|24 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced April 2012, in the Downing Centre District Court, to 15 yrs and 6 months jail - 10 yrs non-parole.|Andrew Stewart pleaded guilty to 2 home invasions in 9 days in 2010. During one of the home invasions a woman was raped. News- "Invaders get 10 years jail" While two men responsible for a harrowing South Grafton home invasion will spend almost a decade behind bars, their accomplice still roams free. South Grafton man Travis Braam, 21 and Clarenza man Andrew Mark Stewart, 24, were sentenced for their part in a brutal Bent St home raid in November 2010. In November last year a Grafton Court heard how the two men pleaded guilty to two home invasions in nine days, one in which a woman was raped and a man had his finger dislocated. Both were sentenced at the Downing Centre District Court last week, with Judge Anthony Garling handing Braam 15 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of nine years and Stewart 15 years and six months, with a non-parole period of 10 years. The men won't be released until November 2019 and November 2020 respectively. Grafton Police's Det Sgt Grahame Burke welcomed the tough sentencing. "This result sends a clear message that these types of offences are considered extremely serious," Det Sgt Burke said. "Any individual involved in a 'run in', as these types of offences are sometimes referred to by the criminal element, should expect a lengthy jail term when arrested." Croydon man Ashley Jack Cullen, 20, was granted bail after pleading guilty to his involvement in the second of the two invasions. Grafton detectives confirmed a warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to appear for sentencing. Anyone who has seen Cullen is urged to contact Grafton Police on 6642 0222 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. http://www.dailyexaminer.com.au/story/2012/04/18/invaders-get-10-years-jail/

"Former Ballarat teacher faces court again on sex charges" (21-11-2012) A former teacher at a Ballarat secondary school has pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse charges. Dennis Michael Stewart, 50, appeared in the dock of the County Court in Ballarat yesterday, where he entered guilty pleas to four counts of committing an indecent act with a child under 16. In a courtroom void of friends or family, Stewart wept as the charges were read to him. The charges relate to two boys who were students at the school where Stewart taught. Three of the charges relate to one boy, and one to the other. The school cannot be named for legal reasons. Stewarts guilty plea spares 25 prosecution witnesses from giving evidence, including his two victims and 17 other civilians. Counsel for Stewart, Ian Hayden said his client would engage with a forensic psychiatrist before the plea hearing, which is scheduled for February 4 at the County Court in Melbourne. A video link will be set up with the Ballarat court to enable interested parties to watch the proceedings. Crown prosecutor Diana Piekusis said the matter was of some complexity and the plea hearing would likely require more than a day of court time. She said it was possible the Crown would cross- examine any medical witnesses put forward by the defence. .|/images/dennis_michael_stewart_2.jpg

News (20-12-2012)- "Paedophile back in jail after schools warning" A paedophile who tried to sell a child-tracking device to parents through the education system and was accused of trying to get work as a relief teacher is back in jail after his parole was cancelled. The Department of Corrective Services has confirmed that Kim Lance Stracke, who was described in a warning to private school principals this month as a "real risk" to children, is in custody. It is believed Kim Stracke, 61, was returned to jail on December 11, the day after a warrant was issued for his arrest when his parole was cancelled. He must spend another two months in jail to complete his sentence. The Prisoners Review Board has confirmed a decision published on its website is about Stracke, though its policy is not to name him. The decision said the board was concerned about Stracke's overall elevated risk of reoffending and risk to community safety. It said its concerns were raised because Stracke attended schools as part of his retail activity and attempted to get a working with children clearance and employment as a relief teacher. The decision said Stracke was also removed from a sex offender program because of his "disruptive" behaviour and that he continued to resist engaging in treatment. Stracke pleaded guilty in 2010 to three counts of indecently dealing with, and two counts of sexual penetration of, a child aged between 13 and 16. His four-year, eight-month jail term was reduced to three years after an appeal. He was given parole in August last year after 18 months on conditions that included no unsupervised contact with children aged under 16, no contact with his victim, that he complies with national sex offender register reporting requirements and not change address without the board's approval. The Education Department told principals on December 3 they should report any contact with Stracke and ask him to leave school premises. An Association of Independent Schools of WA email to private school principals two days later alleged Stracke was trying to work as a relief teacher and was marketing a child-tracking device. When contacted by The West Australian at the time, Stracke denied seeking relief teacher work and said the device he was marketing would not let him track children. Stracke's wife Susan said yesterday the allegations that her husband was seeking a working with children permit and work as a relief teacher were "completely false" and they were working to bring the truth to light. http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/15679902/paedophile-back-in-jail-after-schools-warning/

Pedophile allowed to teach - The court heard in 1980, Robert Brewster, the headmaster of the Toowoomba Preparatory School, was approached by a mother who claimed Strudwick had inappropriately touched her two daughters. After being confronted with the allegations, Strudwick resigned from the school but he was provided with a written reference from Mr Brewster. The reference, which said Strudwick left Toowoomba Prep with the school's blessing, read in part: "He has also captured the enthusiasm of his pupils demonstrating at all times his deep concern for their welfare and progress as well as maintaining the highest possible standards." The reference did not disclose any allegations of sexual misconduct. Strudwick was hired by the Queensland Education Department in October 1980 and taught at Darling Downs schools-below. News (23-8-2007)- "Pedophile allowed to teach"- A PEDOPHILE teacher used a glowing reference from an Anglican school to get a job in the state education system where he abused children, a court has heard. The headmaster of the Toowoomba Preparatory School gave Tony Jenner Strudwick a "very positive" reference despite Strudwick resigning after allegations he had molested two young girls. Strudwick used the reference to get a job with the Queensland Education Department and he later abused children at a Darling Downs primary school. The reference is now central to a personal injury claim by one of Strudwick's victims. Strudwick, 73, was released from jail in 2003 after serving all of his 11 years' sentence for 25 child sex offences including rape. In the Supreme Court yesterday, Justice Ann Lyons allowed an extension of time in which one of Strudwick's victims could bring an action against the Corporation of the Synod of the Diocese of Brisbane, which runs Toowoomba Prep.

Convicted in May 2014 - attempted kidnapping/ causing harm with intent to cause harm (victim was a 70yr old woman). Sentence to be updated.|Eamon Merritt Sumner - Sex Offender/ Repeat Offender- Indecent assault/ grossly indecent acts against 4 women aged between 55 and 68. Arrested 20-8-2012. News (21-8-2012)- "Repeat offender Eamon Merritt Sumner 'tried to abduct' elderly woman at St Agnes" A man charged with the violent attempted abduction of an Adelaide grandmother has a history of sexual offending against elderly women, a court has heard. Eamon Merritt Sumner was arrested and charged yesterday over the alleged abduction of the 70-year-old woman at St Agnes about 7am on Sunday. In opposing bail under any conditions, Sergeant Paul Silvester told the Holden Hill Magistrates Court that Sumner had a lengthy criminal record, only being released from prison in May for offences of serious criminal trespass and indecent assault. Sgt Silvester said Sumner, 27, also had served prison time for indecent assault and grossly indecent acts against four women aged between 55 and 68. "This defendant has a history of sexual assault and grossly indecent acts directed towards elderly women... if he is released, history shows there is very likely to be further offending," he said. Sgt Silvester said the alleged victim had noticed Sumner at a car wash on North East Rd, 20 minutes before he confronted her on Kennedy Ave. He then allegedly grabbed her and tried to force her into the boot of a white Holden Commodore, stomping on her face as she screamed and struggled. Sgt Silvester said the attack only stopped when a male witness verbally challenged Sumner. "If that woman had been forced into the boot we could be dealing with a far greater offence today than we are," he said. He was allegedly identified by CCTV footage and clothes matching the description of the alleged offender were seized from his home. Magistrate Jane Schammer refused to order a home detention bail report because of the gravity of the allegations. "This is right up there with very serious offending and I cannot possibly grant bail in the circumstances that are alleged," she said. Sumner was remanded to appear in court again at a later date. .|/images/eamon-merritt-sumner-2.jpg

"She struggled, it was a particularly violent attack and she managed to struggle free," he said. "She actually led him to believe that she was going to get a condom and instead locked herself in the bathroom, so she was able to get hold of him that way."

However, a judge this morning made the order to release the pedophile, but did not reveal the location of his parents' home, which is reportedly on Brisbane's northside. Brisbane Supreme Court judge Peter Lyons today ordered Daniel Philip Sybenga, 28, be released immediately on a supervised order and allowed to live with his middle-aged mother and father. Sybenga, who has served more than three-and-a-half years longer than his full jail term for sexually molesting numerous young girls, will have to comply with 38 strict conditions, including wearing an electronic monitoring device or obey a curfew and stay away from shopping centres. Justice Lyons, who approved Sybenga's release on Monday, adjourned the hearing until this morning so the Queensland Department of Corrections could assess the suitability of Sybenga living with his parents upon release from jail. In making the order, Justice Lyons did not state where Sybenga would reside upon release, However, The Courier-Mail this morning learned Sybenga had been given approval to live with his parents. Sybenga was only 19 when he committed 16 counts of indecently dealing with nine children under the age of 12 in late 2002 and early 2003. Nine of the 16 offences involved him approaching small girls (aged five or six) in public places and exposing himself. In two cases he touched the children in an indecent manner. The other charges involved the molestation of a three-year-old girl. Sybenga was due for release on July 1, 2008, after his sentence was completed, but has remained in custody. Sybenga was released on an interim order in 2008, but became the subject of an on-going detention order under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 after Sybenga openly spoke about the likelihood of reoffending if released. However, two eminent psychiatrists yesterday testified Sybenga had "made significant gains'' since then _ having recently completed the High Intensity Sexual Offending Program.'' Specialist psychiatrist Dr Michael Beech told the court Sybenga had for the first time since abusing the children demonstrated "significant disgust and shame'' molesting them. But, he said Sybenga's deviant "entrenched pattern of sexual fantasies'' stemmed back to childhood and future arousal could be triggered by viewing adult pornography. Dr Beech said Sybenga had admitted that while in prison he could be easily aroused by reading a Penthouse magazine or "watching late-night SBS programs.'' Psychiatrist Dr Donald Grant said Sybenga appears "very genuine in his attitudes'' and feels "shamed and embarrassed'' by the impact his offending had on his child victims. Barrister Tim Ryan, for the Queensland Attorney-General, said if Sybenga was granted supervised release the order should be imposed for a minimum of 10-years. Mr Ryan said Sybenga would also be subjected to strict conditions, including electronic monitoring or curfew and being forbidden from visiting shopping centres and accessing pornography of any kind. Barrister Mark Green, for Sybenga, said his client's parents had agreed to house the convicted pedophile upon his release. Justice Glenn Martin in 2009 ordered Sybenga be detained because he remained a high risk of reoffending. In September 2010, Justice James Douglas, after also reviewing psychiatric evidence, found Sybenga remained a danger. "His aberrant views about the logic of behaviour towards young girls remain firmly entrenched,'' he said. Justice Douglas found Sybenga's parents were not appropriate supervisors because of concern as to whether they could provide adequate security at home, and their lack of training. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/sex-fiend-daniel-philip-sybenga-to-live-with-parents/story-e6freoof-1226333025643 News (1-9-2010)- "Pedophile should not go free"- A notorious pedophile should be kept in jail because he will reoffend if released, a court has been told.

JOHN SYKES (VIC)|26 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced Feb 2011, in the Latrobe Valley Magistrates Court, to a 3 month suspended sentence- an 18 month community based order,and a supervision order.|Convicted of procuring a girl to make child pornography, and committing an indecent act with a child under 16.. Victim was a 12 yr old girl. News (23-2-2011)- "Man avoids jail over child porn 'grooming'"- A man has been given a suspended sentence for procuring child pornography in Victoria's Latrobe Valley. John Sykes, 26, met the 12-year-old victim at a motorsport event in March last year. The Latrobe Valley Magistrates Court heard they exchanged phone numbers and became Facebook friends. The prosecutor told the court, Sykes sent the girl a photo of his erect penis and encouraged her to send him naked photos of herself. The magistrate said he was concerned by the "pattern of grooming'" and said it was "every parent's nightmare". Sykes was convicted of procuring the girl to make child pornography and committing an indecent act with a child under 16. He received a three-month suspended sentence, an 18-month community-based order and a supervision order. Sykes will be a registered sex offender for 15 years. http://abcaustralia.com/news/stories/2011/02/23/3146228.htm?site=news
TRENT WESLEY SYKES (QLD - Brisbane)|31 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 11-6-2009, in the Toowoomba District Court, to 15 months jail - to be released after having served 6 months to then be subject to 2 yrs probation and 2 yrs good behaviour.|Trent Wesley Sykes - Child Pornography Offence/s. News (12-6-2009)- "Pervert jailed over child porn" Child pornography pervert Trent Wesley Sykes will spend the next six months behind bars for downloading shocking sexual images of children. Some of the images found on the computer used by the 28-year-old to access child pornography included sexual acts by adults with children as young as three to nine-months-old, Toowoomba District Court heard yesterday. Judge Walter Tutt was scathing in his sentencing remarks, describing as "nauseating" and "revolting" the images downloaded by Sykes, copies of which were handed to the court. "One can only speculate as to what depths the mind must sink," Judge Tutt said referring to those who downloaded such material. Sykes was located in Toowoomba in May last year by the Australian Federal Police Child Protection Online Team, responsible for co-ordinating Australias wing of a world-wide police operation cracking down on child exploitation material and pedophile rings. Commonwealth prosecutor Kylie Ward said a search of the material Sykes had accessed included 89 images of child exploitation material depicting naked girls aged five to 14 in various poses, and scenes of adults engaged in sex acts with children aged from three months to 10 years. Because Sykes had no computer of his own, he had accessed the images via his father-in-laws computer during visits to his then-wifes parents home. A subsequent search of Sykes Rangeville home had found an external hard disc drive which contained further images of child pornography, Ms Ward said. The prosecution had sought a sentence of 15 months jail to serve an actual term of about one-third followed by probation. However, Sykes barrister Robbie Davies said, though the website images were "revolting material", his clients offending had been at the lower end of the scale. Mr Davies tended to the court five comparable sentences of similar charges where the offending, in his opinion, was much worse and where the offenders received no jail time at all. His client had already suffered some penalty in that, once his charges became public, he had lost his wife, his job, his reputation and had since had to relocate to Brisbane, he said. Sykes had not transmitted any of the material and would now be subject to the Sex Offenders Register. Mr Davies submitted a fully suspended sentence or intensive correction order. Judge Tutt said: "I must say I am somewhat surprised that the sentences imposed on these types of offences are so low." He sentenced Sykes to 15 months jail, to be released after having served six months to then be subject to two years probation and two years good behaviour. Sykes was also sentenced to 12 months jail, suspended after four months, with the balance to hang over his head for the next two years. http://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/pervert-jailed-over-child-porn/247692/ http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-09-11/man-loses-child-porn-sentence-appeal/1425736 Search MAKO/ Files Online You can search offenders alphabetically by 'Surname'or by 'State/Territory'.A B C D E F G H I-J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W-Z ACT NSW NT QLD SA TAS VIC WA MAKO/Files- WITHIN THE CHURCH FEMALE OFFENDERS MAKO/Files Online..

ROBERT JAMES ANDREWS  (SA- Pennington)|59 yrs old - 2012 |Sentenced in 1996, in the SA Supreme Court to life in jail - 22 yrs non parole. |Robert Andrews - Raped and murdered (strangled) a 43 yr old Christine Jenkins in 1994, while her 2 children were asleep in the next room. Prior 1989 convicted- sentenced for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor.  Update- News (10-3-20100- A convicted murderer who has spent 16 years behind bars for strangling his girlfriend has launched another appeal to quash his conviction. Robert James Andrews is serving a life sentence with a 22-year non-parole period for the murder of Christine Jenkins, 44. He is seeking permission to appeal against his conviction and wants a retrial to examine new evidence he claims was not presented at his 1996 trial. Andrews had initially lodged action in the District Court seeking a retrial, but has withdrawn that and has now lodged a fresh application in the Supreme Court, which was heard before Justice Nyland last Monday. In the application, Andrews lists five grounds for his appeal including that DNA tests were not carried out on cigarette butts found at the crime scene and on samples taken from the victim; that key witnesses were not cross-examined in his trial and that evidence exists to suggest scratches on his face were not inflicted by Ms Jenkins, but by another woman. Andrews' previous appeals - to the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2002, to the High Court in 2003 and the Supreme Court in 2005 - have all failed. Andrews was found guilty of murdering Ms Jenkins in her Ferryden Park home in December 1994. The prosecution alleged he strangled and raped Ms Jenkins because she would not have sex after they returned from a Christmas party. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/killer-lists-grounds-for-court-appeal/story-e6frea83-1226295919085

Michael Anthony Bocchino, 59, faced the Adelaide Magistrates Court today. He was due to enter pleas to one basic count of obtaining access to child pornography, one basic count of possessing child pornography and one aggravated count of possessing child pornography.

PETER CHARLES DEERING (SA)|59 yrs old (2012)|Has spent almost 30 years in detention. To be detained indefinitely (10-1-2012).|Found guilty of four counts of rape in 1986. Victim was a 39 yr old woman. News (10-1-2012)- "'Send rapist Peter Charles Deering to a nursing home', court told"- A rapist who has spent almost 30 years in detention due to his uncontrollable sexual instincts should be in a nursing home, a court has heard. Today, lawyers for Peter Charles Deering, 59, told the Supreme Court their client was an old, ill man who likely posed no risk to the community. Barrister David Stokes said decisions must be made about Deering's future, given changes at Glenside Hospital. "In the long term, Glenside will cease to have open rehabilitation beds," he said. "It will be inappropriate for Deering to be held in a secure facility for young, difficult and volatile people (but) no nursing home will take him. "It's an appalling situation." In December 1986, Deering was found guilty of four counts of rape against a woman, 39. The year before, he forced his way into her Kurralta Park flat. He grabbed her by the hair, banged her head on the floor, threatened her with a knife and demanded sex. In sentencing, then-Justice Graham Prior said medical reports showed Deering was incapable of controlling his sexual instincts. "A case of this kind would, on its own, call for a sentence of imprisonment in excess of 10 years," he said. Because of Deering's medical issues, however, Justice Prior ordered he serve nine years' jail and be detained "at Her Majesty's pleasure" after that term had expired. Deering who attended court today under supervision has since made several failed applications for release. Today Pauline Barnett, prosecuting, asked the court to continue his detention indefinitely. "Age and ill health seem to have overtaken him and the chemical therapies appear to operate successfully, showing some signs of controlling aberrant behaviour," she said. "But it remains an open question as to whether he is willing to control his sexual urges. "One doctor is still of the opinion Deering presents some concern or risk to the community, and feels the detention should therefore continue." Mr Stokes said Deering's nurses had "no concerns" about him. "Of course, one cannot make guarantees," he said. "But that same doctor concludes his report by saying he believes it would be appropriate 'to explore the possibility of a nursing home'." However, he said he would not oppose the prosecution application "this time". Justice Trish Kelly said the reports indicated Deering could "never be discharged" due to his "incapacity to live independently". "It's a Catch-22 situation," she said. "I'm not going to say it's all or nothing because, next thing, there will be complaints he's running around beaches and children's playgrounds. "It seems to me you are both correct, but the interests of justice and of the community require me to accede to the prosecution's application." She ordered Deering remain in detention. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/send-rapist-peter-charles-deering-to-a-nursing-home-court-told/story-e6frea83-1226240669251 Thanks for voting!

STEPHEN JOHN FOSTER (SA- Ethelton)|63 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 1-11-2011, in the Adelaide District Court, to 3 yrs jail - 18 months non parole.|Stephen Foster - pleaded guilty to aggravated dissemination and possession of child pornography. News (1-11-2011)- AN Adelaide man caught hoarding child pornography by US authorities has been jailed for three years. The District Court this morning ordered Stephen John Foster serve at least 18 months of that sentence before being eligible for parole. Foster, 63, of Ethelton, pleaded guilty to aggravated dissemination and possession of child pornography. His perverted collection of 19,100 images and 1060 videos was uncovered by the New Mexico branch of the Federal Bureau of Investigations during an online sting operation. Foster unwittingly shared some of his haul with an FBI special agent in October 2010, leading to his arrest by SA Police in January this year. In sentencing today, Judge Dean Clayton said most of Foster's images and videos fell into the first two categories of child pornography, deemed to be the "less serious". Others, however, were of the highest category which includes acts of bondage and bestiality. "This is not a victimless crime," Judge Clayton said. "The production, possession and dissemination of child pornography leads to the abuse of many children around the world." He said Foster's illicit hobby developed while he served as the primary carer for his aged parents. "Your siblings hold you in high regard, saying you sacrificed a lot in selflessly taking on that role," he said. "But performing that role isolated you from normal social contact and you became reclusive, developing an interest in pornography five to six years ago." Prior to sentencing, Foster's lawyer read a letter of apology to the court. "(This is) a time in my life I'm ashamed of, and I'm sorry I didn't have the sense to do (things) differently," it said. "I would like to put this sorry time behind me... and would like a chance to finally get my life back on track." Judge Clayton, however, said neither that contrition nor Foster's previous good character warranted suspension of his sentence. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/recluse-63-jailed-over-thousands-of-child-porn-images-after-fbi-sting/story-e6frea83-1226182362680|/images/stephen_foster_2.jpg

Convicted in February 2012 of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl in late 2010, at an out-of-school hours care program he ran at a public school. "Paedophile worked at two other public schools" (12-12-2012) A man convicted of raping a girl at an Adelaide out-of-school hours care program in 2010 worked in at least two other public schools, the Education Department has revealed. Mark Christopher Harvey was convicted earlier this year of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl who attended the OSHC program he ran at a public school in the north-western suburbs in 2010. The Education Department today said the man worked for OSHC or Vacation Care programs at two other public schools in suburban Adelaide from 1994 to 2006. A statement from the department, supplied after a request by adelaidenow, says the man also worked "for brief periods" as a School Services Officer at two of the three public schools on short-term temporary contracts in 1998 and 2010. As reported by adelaidenow early last month, the man also worked in OSHC and Vacation Care at an Adelaide Catholic school between 2000 and 2004. The department has written to parents at each school to inform them and outline available support services. A spokesman for the department said it was "still seeking some final details and their verification" about other aspects of the man's employment history. "One issue is that as OSHC is run by Governing Councils, they hold the employment records rather than the department, but we are working to recover these," he said. "Similarly records of employment in the non-government education sectors are not available to DECD." .

"School groundsman jailed for 'despicable' affair with schoolgirl" (1-7-2007) A high school groundskeeper who destroyed a teenager's life through illicit sex has been jailed for six years. The District Court today ordered Andrew John Janoska be ineligible for release on parole until October 2015. Judge David Smith said Janoska's "jealous and possessive" three-year relationship with a schoolgirl was "despicable behaviour". "You sought out an easy target for your sexual drive," he said. "You used your position to seek-out and woo a young schoolgirl... what you did was classically predatory. "You effectively wrecked three crucial years of this young complainant's life and scarred the rest of her life." Janoska, 46, of Nailsworth, pleaded guilty to nine counts of unlawful sexual intercourse. He committed the offences between March 2001 and November 2003. Over that period, his victim was aged between 14 and 16 Janoska, meanwhile, was aged between 36 and 38. In sentencing today, Judge Smith said Janoska and the girl exchanged phone calls and text messages before having sex in his caravan. "She became obsessed with you, and you became possessive of her," he said. The girl stayed with him while he house-sat for a friend, having sex "three to four times". Judge Smith said the girl's parents learned of the relationship in May 2001 and went to the police. The girl, however, refused to make a statement. "Her mother laments that she felt powerless to stop what was happening," Judge Smith said. "She gave in to the relationship so she could salvage some relationship with her daughter. "The fact she tolerated you under her roof on some occasions is not a matter of mitigation." Judge Smith said Janoska's "jealousy and possessiveness worsened", and the girl ended the relationship shortly before her 18th birthday. She made a statement to police in July 2008, and Janoska was arrested in March 2010. Judge Smith said Janoska had shown remorse, and had suffered "a nervous breakdown" while undergoing sex offender counselling. He said Janoska was suicidal, and urged prison authorities to keep a close eye on him. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/school-groundsman-jailed-for-despicable-affair-with-schoolgirl/story-e6frea83-1226085455190

Ric Marshall was a beloved Adelaide celebrity in the 1960s and 1970s, working extensively on television and with the now-notorious Cottage Theatre. The men were tried separately, however, because Ric Marshall was found to be mentally unfit to stand trial. The District Court has yet to determine whether he will be ordered to serve a limiting term. During Peter Marshall's trial - which was held in a closed court, with all evidence given subject to suppression orders - prosecutors alleged he offended against boys aged between 11 and 12 years. They claimed the offences occurred in Adelaide, Gilberton, Malvern and Renmark. One boy, they alleged, was persistently sexually abused between December 1971 and December 1974. Acts of buggery, they claimed, were committed between June and December 1974, and between March and September 1975. Prosecutors further alleged Peter Marshall's victims had already been groomed by his "father" at the time of his offences. Judge Anne Bampton - who heard the trial in the absence of a jury - found Peter Marshall guilty on June 10 last year. She then suppressed both her guilty verdict and her written reasons from publication. Today Libby Griffith, prosecuting, said Peter Marshall had committed serious crimes against vulnerable children. "His offending resulted in a great deal of shame and misery for the victims," she said. "It has adversely affected many aspects of the rest of their lives." She said Marshall - who faces a maximum life-sentence - deserved little mercy. "There has been no acknowledgment of guilt in any way nor, in any way whatsoever, evidence of contrition or remorse," she said. "There is no evidence before this court of any sort of rehabilitation... consequently, there is no mitigation available." Ms Griffith said any claims Peter Marshall may make about being a victim himself held little weight. "The mere fact an offender was a victim of sexual abuse should serve to bring home the terrible consequences for their own victims," she said. Judge Bampton remanded Peter Marshall on continuing bail for further submissions next month. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/identity-and-case-of-paedophile-peter-john-marshall-can-now-be-reported/story-e6frea83-1226266638345|/images/peter_john_marshall_2.jpg

Timothy Hemi Schaefer, 19, went to the home of Jeffrey Edwin Payne, 56, in Adelaide in April 2007, called him a "pedo", punched him and stabbed him in the leg. Drunk and taunting his victim, Schaefer followed Mr Payne across parklands before strangling and stabbing him and stomping on his head, the South Australian Supreme Court has heard after Schaefer pleaded guilty to murder. Prosecutor Jane Powell said there was an element of "sanguinary" to the crime, with Schaefer stopping to smoke a cigarette during the brutal and prolonged attack. Schaefer had never expressed remorse for killing Mr Payne, who was an extremely thin man, weighing just 47kg, with ulcers and emphysema, she said. .
ANDREW KNOLLER PEARCE (Andrew Knoller Pearce) (SA)|58 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in August 2013, in the SA District Court to 14 yrs jail - 8 yrs non parole.|Andrew Knoller Pearce was found guilty in July, 2013 of the persistent sexual exploitation of two boys between 1994 and 2002. "Radio producer finally admits sex offences" (28-8-2013) A former radio producer found guilty of child sex crimes has spoken directly to one of his victims in court, finally admitting to his eight years of offending. At his sentencing on Wednesday, Andrew Knoller Pearce stood in the dock in the District Court in Adelaide and told a story involving the family friend, who was aged about 12 at the time. He said they had been driving home one day back in about 2000 when the boy asked to get out of the car. Pearce stopped but later drove around the block in a bid to find the boy again. When he finally located him he told him he would not have been able to live with himself if anything bad had happened to him. But he said the truth was: "I was the bad thing that was happening to you at that time." Pearce also told the victim and his family that he was now sorry for putting them through the trauma of a trial over his "terrible" crimes and said there was no excuse for his offending. "It's something for which I will be eternally sorry," he said. Pearce, 59, was found guilty in July of the persistent sexual exploitation of two boys between 1994 and 2002. He had been living with a family at suburban Valley View at the time and one of his victims was their son and the other a friend of the son. Judge Julie McIntyre said Pearce took advantage of his good reputation to engage in prolonged, frequent and systematic offending to gratify his sexual desires. The judge described his future as bleak and jailed him for 14 years with a non-parole period of eight years. .|/imagesw/andrew-knoller-pearce-2.jpg

DIETER PFENNIG (SA - Adelaide)|yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in 1992, to life in jail/ 38yrs non parole.|Dieter Pfennig - Convicted child Killer and Paedophile..Jailed in 1992 for the abduction and murder of 10 yr old Murray Bridge schoolboy, Michael Black, in January 1989.. Pfennig pleaded guilty in 1990 to abducting and sexually assaulting a 13 yr old boy. "Man charged over the 1983 murder of South Australian schoolgirl Louise Bell" (19-11-2013) New forensic evidence led to Major Crime detectives charging a former schoolteacher in the Louise Bell murder case. The evidence forms the backbone of the case against former schoolteacher Dieter Pfennig, 65, who was today charged with the murder of the 10-year-old schoolgirl. In a sensational development in the 30-year old mystery, detectives from the Major Crime Investigation Section descended on Port Lincoln. Pfennig, who has been a suspect in the Bell abduction for two decades, was taken to the Port Lincoln police station after being arrested and formally interviewed. He was then charged with murder. In an Adelaide Magistrates Court hearing before Magistrate Jayanthi McGrath, he appeared via videolink from Port Lincoln Magistrates Court and was remanded to next appear in February. He sat emotionless and silent. The arrest was the culmination of a two-year cold-case review in which many pieces of evidence, including the pyjama top worn by Louise, were sent to the Netherlands by police for advanced DNA testing. The pyjama top was left on the front lawn of a neighbour's house two months after Louise was abducted from her bedroom on the night of January 4, 1983. The DNA testing used new "low-copy'' testing techniques that have been successfully used in other jurisdictions, including the US. The low-copy method of DNA testing is a far more sensitive technique than the method used in Australia. It can extract a DNA profile from just a few cells of skin or sweat. The review also led to police excavating the backyard of a Hackham West house that was occupied by Pfennig when Louise was abducted. It was the second time his house had been searched by officers investigating the case. Deputy Commissioner Grant Stevens declined to be drawn on the nature of the new evidence against Pfennig, but said police would allege he abducted Louise from her bedroom sometime after 10.30pm on January 4. They believe he acted alone and no other suspects are being sought. "She has not been seen since and unfortunately her remains have not been located,'' Mr Stevens said. "This is a significant step forward in the investigation and is evidence once again that police continue to investigate murders, regardless of their age or the difficulty of those investigations.'' Mr Stevens paid tribute to the current investigators and others, many of whom have since retired, who also sought to bring Louise's killer to justice. . Anyone with any information on Louise Bell's abduction is urged to contact BankSA Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.|/images/dieter-pfennig-2.jpg
MINH TUAN PHAM (Minh Tuan Pham) (SA - Ferryden Park)|33 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in Feb 2011, in the SA District Court, to 9 yrs jail - 5 yrs non parole.|Minh Tuan Pham - Pham a Doctor, strangled a 20 yr old woman until she was unconscious and raped her. "Obsessed Adelaide doctor jailed for raping dancer" (24-2-2011) An Adelaide doctor has been jailed for raping an exotic dancer who refused him sex after he lavished her with gifts and paid for her breast enlargements. Minh Tuan Pham, 33, of Ferryden Park, became sexually obsessed with the 20-year-old woman who worked at an Adelaide nightspot, wooing her in 2008 in the hope that she would fall in love with him. But she refused sex, despite being offered as much as $20,000, District Court Judge Mark Griffin said today, as he sentenced Pham to nine years in jail for raping his victim and causing aggravated harm. "It was deliberate, purposive and calculated," the judge said. "Violent crimes against women are particularly abhorrent to all right-thinking members of the community." Pham wined and dined the woman, paid for her breast augmentation, and gave her extravagant gifts including a car. But she clearly did not want an intimate relationship, despite the cash incentive, the judge said. Pham should have been smart enough to work out that his obsession "was little more than an expensive illusion", Justice Griffin said. Instead he overpowered the woman, strangling her until she was unconscious so he could have unprotected sex. Pham was a trained doctor who should have known the harm he was causing, the judge said. Not only had Pham shown no remorse, but he had created elaborate and unbelievable lies for the jury that convicted him. Pham had brought shame on his family, handed in his medical licence and was unlikely to ever practice again, the court heard. He was sentenced to nine years in jail with a non-parole period of five years. http://www.news.com.au/national/obsessed-adelaide-doctor-jailed-for-raping-dancer/story-e6frfkvr-1226011357706 "Rapist doctor lied about his referee" (16-2-2011) A doctor who raped a stripper has admitted lying about a referee he met in a massage parlour. In the District Court yesterday, Judge Mark Griffin labelled Minh Tuan Pham's dishonesty "discreditable" but said he would not take it into account when sentencing. Pham, 33, of Ferryden Park, was found guilty by a District Court jury of rape and aggravated causing harm but acquitted of aggravated serious criminal trespass in a place of residence. He raped his then-20-year-old victim in her home and wrapped a belt around her neck for "erotic asphyxiation", causing her face and neck injuries.- http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/ipad/rapist-doctor-lied-about-his-referee/story-fn6bqphm-1226006607281|/images/minh_tuan_pham_2.jpg
WARWICK DAVID PHILLIPS  (SA - Kilburn)|44 yrs old (2010) |Sentenced in the Adelaide District Court to 4.5 yrs jail- suspended on condition Phillips enters into good behaviour bond. |Former cycling champion. Pleaded guilty in 2009 to 7 counts of unlawful sexual intercourse. "Club lets sex abuse rider join" (30-1-2011) A cycling club has controversially allowed a former coach who sexually abused a teenage girl to join. Warwick Phillips - who pleaded guilty in 2009 to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 16-year-old cyclist he coached - is banned from membership with Cycling SA and Cycling Australia. But Phillips, who received a four-and-a-half-year suspended sentence, continues to ride competitively because the Southern Districts Veteran and Ladies Cycling Club granted him a membership last year despite the bans by the state and national cycling bodies. The membership has split the cycling community, with businesses dumping sponsorship deals with the club and some riders refusing to race against him. Phillips, a father of three, represented the club at a race meeting earlier this month and is eligible to compete in the National Veterans Cycling Championships to be held in Adelaide in May. But the former SA Cycling coach's club membership and continued involvement in competitive racing has angered many cyclists, according to SA Veteran Cycling Association president Robert Freak. "This whole situation has caused enormous pain and enormous loss of sponsorship," Mr Freak said. "It has also created a lot of ill feeling. There are some riders who won't ride with Phillips." Southern Districts club president Geoff Bates said he was aware of Phillips' ban by the other cycling bodies and some concern had been raised by people about his membership. .|/images/warwick_phillips_1.jpg

See co-offender - Benjamin Robert McPartland. "SA woman Ashlee Jean Polkinghorne pleads guilty to manslaughter of daughter, 4" (20-2-2014) A woman accused of killing her daughter, 4, by making the injured child ride a 50kg motorbike while she recorded videos and laughed has confessed to manslaughter. Ashlee Jean Polkinghorne, 22, wiped at her face as she stood in the Supreme Court dock today and pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter. She and Benjamin Robert McPartland, 27, had been jointly charged with the January 2012 manslaughter of Polkinghornes daughter, Chloe Valentine . Prosecutors had alleged Chloe was placed on a motorcycle that crashed into a tree in an Ingle Farm backyard. They further alleged the pairs reports to the ambulance crews at the scene were inconsistent. In July, McPartland and Polkinghorne pleaded not guilty to the charge and were ordered to stand trial . In December, however, McPartland pleaded guilty on the basis he unlawfully killed Chloe . At that time, the court heard Polkinghorne maintained her not guilty plea but there remained a possibility her matter might resolve. This week, Polkinghorne went before Justice Trish Kelly for pre-trial legal argument. Justice Kelly heard a childs motorbike, which weighed 50kg, arrived at the couples home on the Tuesday before Chloe died. Prosecutor Sandi McDonald, SC, said Chloe was repeatedly put on the bike between Tuesday and Friday despite sustaining injuries including two black eyes and significant bruising. She said Polkinghorne recorded several videos of her daughter falling off the motorbike and McPartland putting her back on. She said the couple could be heard laughing in the video. Ms McDonald said that, on the Friday afternoon, Google searches were made on the couples computer for the terms out cold and wont wake up. The computer was also used to access Facebook and internet banking. Ms McDonald said several hours after the searches began, an ambulance was called. She said life support was turned off about 7pm on Saturday night. Ms McDonald said that, in a videotaped police interview recorded at the hospital, Polkinghorne told officers Chloe had hit her head on a doorframe in the kitchen before she fell unconscious. The police officer who was in the interview gave evidence, telling the court doctors at the hospital could not find a correlating bump on Chloes head. Today, lawyers for Polkinghorne asked their client be re-arraigned on the manslaughter charge, after which she entered a plea of guilty. Justice Kelly remanded her on continuing bail to a further hearing next week. .|/images/ashlee-polkinghorne.jpg

News (23-12-2010)- "Hidden camera photographed female shoppers in Rundle Mall"- A MAN who took "up-skirt" photos of Rundle Mall shoppers with a hidden camera has 12 months to prove he deserves a suspended sentence. William Smiley will not have to go to jail if he can show, by December 2011, he has changed his "dreadful" attitude toward women. Smiley, 40, of Elizabeth North, pleaded guilty to 19 counts of engaging in indecent filming, and two counts of attempting to distribute indecent material. In June, he took video and still images up the skirts of women in Rundle Mall. He stood next to his victims and put his bag on the ground - it contained a hidden camera. Smiley then attempted to sell the images online. Today Lisa Schutz, for Smiley, said her client "demonstrated a capacity to recognise" the wrongness of his actions, thanks to counselling. She said the case had parallels with the ongoing St Kilda nude footballers controversy. "My client has been charged under what are fairly new laws that don't appear to exist interstate," she said. "What the (football case) girl has done would be an offence in this jurisdiction." Jackie Young, prosecuting, said Smiley's victims would have been shamed had he sold the footage. "This was an affront to the modesty of the victims," she said. "Legislators in SA have been quite forward in recognising this." Magistrate Mary-Louise Hribal agreed. "Initially, your view was that you were not hurting anyone, but this was a dreadful invasion of privacy," she told Smiley. "Your attitude toward women was truly dreadful. "You now realise this crime is not victimless, that you invaded these women's privacy, and that it was totally unacceptable." She imposed a seven-month jail term, but suspended its activation under what is known as a "Griffiths Remand". The sentencing option gives offenders an opportunity to rehabilitate while living under strict bail conditions. Ms Hribal ordered Smiley undergo sex offender treatment and counselling and return to court in December 2011. "Should you engage fully and participate in the treatment programs, and there is no like offending during the remand, I'm likely to suspend your sentence," she said. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/hidden-camera-photographed-female-shoppers-in-rundle-mall/story-e6frea83-1225975456574|/images/william_james_smiley.jpg

News (20-12-2012)- "Rapist Gregory James Smith jailed for 14 years for crime committed in 1989" A cowardly rapist has finally been jailed, 23 years after abducting a woman described by a judge as "resourceful and courageous". Gregory James Smith, 52, was today sentenced to 14 years' jail with a non-parole period of seven years and six months. In November 1989, Smith and James Trevor Birmingham approached a woman walking to the YMCA on Flinders St. They forced her into a car and drove her to the Adelaide Hills where they raped her repeatedly.

"Ex- lecturer's porn shame" (17-3-2012) Former university lecturer Frank Tesoriero devoted much of his life to helping the disadvantaged. Yet for years, he contributed to the degradation of children by downloading and sharing child pornography. Tesoriero - a former associate professor at the University of SA and Flinders University - was arrested in April last year and pleaded guilty in the District Court to aggravated possession and dissemination of child pornography, which attracts a maximum 10-year prison term. The court heard this week that Tesoriero had taken part in online sex chat rooms and had been downloading child pornography undetected "for years". Tesoriero, of Parkside, left his position at UniSA several years ago and retired from Flinders University in August last year. A Flinders spokesman said the university was unaware of the Tesoriero's pornography charges until contacted by the Sunday Mail and it immediately terminated any association with him. Tesoriero's former UniSA profile - removed from its website on Friday - said he had overseen numerous programs to help the disadvantaged and mentally ill. Tesoriero, 62, told Judge David Lovell he realised his offending was "repugnant" and "morally wrong". The judge remanded Tesoriero on bail so he can continue counselling before he decides whether the sentence should be suspended in September. .

Thomson was sentenced to three years in jail and will be eligible for parole in October next year. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-04-29/babysitter-jailed-for-throwing-toddler-at-wall/2701376 http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/ipad/child-bashers-facebook-fury/story-fn6bqpju-1226000776394 Injury too severe for a fall, court told- (20-1-2011) http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/bashed-toddler-fell-from-drawers/story-e6frea83-1225991093730|/images/stuart_thomson_3.jpg

RONALD LOUIS TUCKWELL  (SA- Hoyleton)|78 yrs old-2012|Sentenced in June 2008, to 10 yrs jail - 6 yrs non parole.|Ronald Tuckwell- Paedophile. Repeat Offender. Pedophile gets extra jail time- (2-4-2009) FORMER community leader and convicted pedophile Ronald Louis Tuckwell has been ordered to serve another year in jail for sex offences. The sentence, imposed by the Adelaide Magistrates Court today, means Tuckwell will not be eligible for parole until he is 81. Tuckwell, 75, of Hoyleton, pleaded guilty to four counts of indecent assault, all against different victims aged 13 and under between 1960 and 1977. Magistrate Terrence Forrest told the court two of the offences had occurred "within a day or similar short period of the parents of the victim having separated." "Obviously the victims were in a position of considerable vulnerability," Mr Forrest said. "The offending you have engaged in has enourmous effects on its victims." He said Tuckwell had been shamed by the public knowing about his offences. "It has been put that you have suffered the shame and harm of your conduct having been exposed in more recent times." But he said the victim's experiences in re-telling what had happened to them to police officers was stressful. "That you have suffered a degree of harm will be of little comfort for your victims," he told the court. Mr Forrest said Tuckwell had not committed any offence since 1981, and imposed one sentence for the four counts of indecent assault. Tuckwell was sentenced in the District Court in June last year to 10 years in prison with a non-parole period of six years for five counts of unlawful sexual intercourse and four counts of indecent assault in the 1970s and 1980s. Another 12-month sentence with a non-parole period of three months was imposed on Tuckwell in the District Court in November last year for one count of indecent assault in 1961. Magistrate Forrest further extended Tuckwell's jail term by 27 months and ordered his six-year non-parole period be extended by 12 months. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/pedophile-gets-extra-jail-time/story-e6freo8c-1225698128249
PHILLIP TURTUR (SA - Salisbury)|64 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in May 2012 to 23yrs jail/ 15yrs non parole.|Paedophile - Pleaded guilty in the Adelaide District Court, to one count of persistent sexual exploitation of a child, 12 counts of unlawful sexual intercourse, and one count of indecent assault. "Victim relieved as 'grotesque' paedophile jailed" (30-5-2012) A paedophile who abused two girls throughout their childhood years has been sentenced to at least 15 years in jail. The sentencing judge has described the man's crimes as "grotesque". The Adelaide District Court heard Phillip Turtur, 64, subjected his young victims to repeated violent rapes during the 1980s and '90s. The first victim was seven when the abuse started and the other was 11 when Turtur first abused her. Judge Geoffrey Muecke said Turtur subjected both to "indescribable horror" during years of abuse. "You abused both of them in a frighteningly callous way," he said. "For five long years she lived in dread, never knowing when you would pounce but expecting it at any time. No child should have to live with this terror hanging over their head. "[The victim] began dissociating with reality because the reality was so horrific and traumatising, at just seven years of age." The first victim, who consented to being identified as Joanne, was once Turtur's niece. Judge Muecke said the abuse had started when her family visited her grandfather's grave. "The family would be at the cemetery for about two hours each Sunday, it seems it also became a tradition for you to sexually abuse Joanne when the family was at the cemetery," he said. "You did that for the next four years, from when Joanne was seven to 11." The judge said the second victim had been abused into her teenage years and was severely affected as a result. The court heard Turtur raped her immediately after she had cut her wrists with a razor blade. Judge Muecke sentenced Turtur to 23 years' jail, with a non-parole period of 15 years. Turtur will be almost 80 before he will be eligible to seek release. Outside court, Joanne said she and the other victim felt relieved after the sentencing. "We as survivors are incredibly relieved that this is over, it has taken a lot of courage and energy to get to this point," she said. "No sentence will take away our pain and suffering but we feel the sentence is some recognition of what we have endured. "I think we both feel that we have achieved justice, definitely." She thanked her supporters during the legal process. "I've had a lot of really good family support, my immediate family and really great friends and I think that's really helped along the way," she said. Joanne said she would now focus on ways to support other abuse victims. "I want other girls who have been in my position, who are out there and wanting to come forward, to come forward because it's a great relief and not to be scared because they will be supported," she said. "The pain and suffering is something that is there, but I'm happy with my life now and this is something I'll never forget." http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-29/paedophile-jailed-phillip-turtur/4039778?section=sa "'Monster' Phillip Turtur sexually abused girl as her family grieved each week" (3-5-2012) A "disgusting monster" abused a young girl every Sunday while her family mourned at her grandfather's grave, a court has heard. Yesterday, to the sound of sobbing from supporters in the public gallery, the District Court heard the victim impact statements of those injured by Phillip Turtur's sexual crimes. Turtur, 64, of Salisbury, had pleaded guilty to one count of persistent sexual exploitation of a child, 12 counts of unlawful sexual intercourse and one count of indecent assault. He repeatedly abused two girls, while in a position of trust, between 1982 and 1994. His crimes occurred in various Adelaide suburbs, causing the girls and their families enduring psychological pain. Yesterday, one victim said she was just seven years old when the abuse began. "You murdered my body and my mind and it was my job as a seven-year-old to hold it together all on my own," she said. "I look upon you as a monster who has shown no remorse; you deserve to be locked in a cell, alone and isolated like I was." But despite her past, the woman proudly told the court she was finally a "confident, happily married woman". "Now the person who has died from me is you; your reign of terror has ended," she said. "My life is empowered by bringing you justice." Martin Kirby, prosecuting, said while that victim's family visited the grave of a loved one every Sunday, Turtur would make arrangements for her to stay with him and he would abuse her. He said that on one occasion Turtur had threatened one of his victims with a butcher's knife to keep his secret. "Mr Turtur produced a sharp knife, I think it was described as a butcher's knife, which he put to the throat of this young victim," Mr Kirby said. "It was a continued threat in the victim's mind of the consequences of complying, of not doing what she was told." Turtur was remanded in custody and will be sentenced this month. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/monster-phillip-turtur-sexually-abused-girl-as-her-family-grieved-each-week/story-e6frea83-1226346291608|/images/phillip-turtur-2.jpg

Victim was a 19yr old man. "Drug rapist jailed" (4-4-2007) A chronic ice user who kidnapped and assaulted a teenager before raping him at knifepoint, will spend at least 5 1/2 years behind bars. Michael Scott Wald, 22, was fuelled by a volatile mixture of alcohol and the dangerous methamphetamine when he abducted his male victim from Frankston in March last year and raped him twice beside a railway track. Wald, of Seaford, pleaded guilty to rape, armed robbery, false imprisonment and intentionally causing injury. The County Court heard Wald had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, and was of low intelligence after a motorcycle crash left him with a brain injury. Judge John Barnett said Wald, who had convictions for more than 100 offences including theft, armed robbery and assault, had failed to heed previous court warnings over his substance abuse. The court was told Wald sneaked up behind his teenage victim in Frankston's business district, put a knife to his neck and demanded his mobile phone. When he tried to flee, Wald marched him through the streets, smashing his head against walls, fire hydrants and windows. He then raped him at knifepoint, telling him he "would not be going home tonight". When the assault was over, Wald said "I get like this when I'm drunk", and apologised, telling the victim he didn't deserve the attack, the court heard. Judge Barnett said Wald had shown only limited remorse and his cruel actions had had a devastating effect on the teen: "The community expects such behaviour to be strongly denounced." He sentenced Wald to 7 1/2 years' jail with a non-parole period of 5 1/2 years, and ordered he be placed on the serious sex offenders registry. .

"Former school teacher Mark Clive Wildy jailed for child sex offences" (29-10-2011) Philanthropist, former teacher and scout leader Mark Clive Wildy has been jailed for abusing a child. The District Court yesterday ordered Wildy, brother of radio personality David, serve a minimum 18 months jail for child sex offences committed 30 years ago. Judge Mark Griffin said although Wildy did not groom his victim or set out to make him amenable for sexual acts, his crimes were "repugnant" and general deterrence was a significant factor in sentencing. A jury previously found Wildy guilty of two counts of indecent assault, one of attempted unlawful sexual intercourse and two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse. Judge Griffin said Wildy had become the "one stable character" in his victim's life. "He looked to you more and more for support," Judge Griffin said.

MARC BRUCE TALLY (QLD- Bundaberg West)|28 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Marc Bruce Tally. Convicted Sex Offender- Pleaded guilty in Bundaberg Magistrates Court to one charge of attempting to change his name as a reportable offender. News (30-7-2012)- "Sex offender tried to change name" A convicted sex offender has faced court after trying to change his surname without the consent of the Police Commissioner. Marc Bruce Tally, 28, of Bundaberg West, pleaded guilty in Bundaberg Magistrates Court yesterday to one charge of attempting to change his name as a reportable offender. Police prosecutor Senior Constable Fiona Ward said Tally became a reportable offender under the Child Protection Act last year after being convicted of having a consensual relationship with a girl under the age of consent. Snr Const Ward said Tally had been issued with and signed two sets of paperwork concerning his rights and obligations as a reportable offender, which were also explained to him - one of those being that he had to seek consent from the Commissioner before trying to change his name. But earlier this year, Tally made an application to the New South Wales Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages to have his surname changed to Taliana. "The defendant said he was not intentionally deceiving anyone," Snr Const Glover said. "He said he was looking at moving to New South Wales to start a new job and he wanted to start under a new name. "The offence itself is quite a significant breach." Lawyer Warren Highland said his client was not aware he had to ask the Commissioner's permission to change his name and only found out when the registry told him. Mr Highland said Tally then contacted the Bundaberg Police Station to ask how to go about seeking permission. "My client prior to this matter has complied in every respect in relation to his obligations under the act," he said. "The name Taliana was a family name ... so it's not simply a name he's picked out of the air." Mr Highland said his client planned to move interstate because he had been offered a job as the assistant manager of a bowling alley. "He wanted to change back to the original family name and wanted to move on," he said. The court heard Tally was subject to a suspended sentence at the time of the offence. Magistrate Jennifer Batts adjourned the sentence to August 13 so she could take into consideration the transcript from Tally's original sentence that landed him on the reportable offender list. http://www.news-mail.com.au/story/2012/07/30/sex-offender-tried-change-name/

"Bike path rapist Phillip Taupin jailed for nine years over attacks on 10 females in Melbourne's north" (11-9-2013) A violent rapist who terrorised and attacked 10 females in Melbourne?s northern suburbs has been hit with a nine-year prison sentence. Phillip Taupin, 32, stalked his victims on bike paths and parkland through the Darebin, Reservoir and Coburg areas in 2011, 2012 and January this year, indecently assaulting women and girls as young as 15, the County Court heard today. Several victims were pushed to the ground and sexually assaulted or molested by Taupin, who on occasions rode a small motorbike around the females and wore a full-face helmet to hide his identity. In August 2011, armed with a pair of broken scissors which he held to one victims throat, Taupin subjected a young woman to a protracted and violent rape in which the female feared for her safety and felt compelled to comply with his demands, the court was told. Judge Meryl Sexton described the sex attacks as repulsive, cowardly and predatory acts in public places. "It remains every womans greatest fear that she may be attacked by a stranger while alone," she said. "General deterrence is of considerable importance in a case such as this. "By my sentence of you, I must seek to deter other men who think that they can prey upon women for their sexual gratification as if they had a right to do so." Judge Sexton said Taupins explanation to police after his arrest that he was lonely was pathetic. She applauded the courage of the female victims who spoke out about the abuse and fought Taupin during the assaults, saying they were not powerless and the court had heard their voices. In imposing a slightly higher sentence than that sought by prosecutors, Judge Sexton said Taupin had been identified as having a sexual deviancy with a high-to-moderate risk of reoffending and he would require a sex offenders treatment program while in custody. Judge Sexton sentenced Taupin to a maximum of nine years and three months jail with a minimum of seven years. Prosecutors had sought a range of seven to nine years. Taupin, who was unemployed at the time of the assaults, pleaded guilty to one charge of rape, nine charges of indecent assault, recklessly causing injury, assault and making a threat. "Rape victim tells court: I felt like a hunted animal" - (22-7-2013) A woman has told a court she "felt like an animal being hunted" after she was savagely raped on a bike path in Melbourne's north. Phillip Taupin, 33, pleaded guilty today to nine charges of indecent assault, making threats to inflict serious injury, rape, recklessly causing serious injury and common law assault. The County Court heard he would circle many of his victims - some as young as 15 - on his dirt bike on bike paths, preying on them before attacking the females. His first victim was walking in Lalor after finishing work late at night and he followed her from the train station. With a hood covering Taupin's face, he put a pair of scissors at her throat and said, "Don't say a word" as they began to wrestle and fell to the ground. The victim used all her wavering strength to fight off her attacker before being raped. In her victim impact statement read to court, the woman said she now felt self blame, worthlessness, guilt and had considered ending her life. "At the time I felt like an animal being hunted," she said. "I was savagely attacked, violated, poked and probed like an object that was used abused and thrown away like I was nothing. "My confidence of safety in the world has been significantly impacted. "Reliving and recalling all the details of the night where pieces of me were shattered and left scattered burden my spirit." The court was told that in December last year Taupin attacked a woman after she finished exercising on an oval in Mill Park. She was able to break free after hitting him in the testicles. In another eight attacks Taupin would ride his dirt bike around his victims on bike paths in Lalor, Thomastown, Reservoir, Fawkner and Coburg. He slapped some on the buttocks, grabbed one victim from behind and grabbed the thigh of a 15-year-old girl and then slapped the buttocks of her friend as the pair walked back from a milk bar. Taupin remains in custody and returns to court on August 15, when his plea hearing continues. http://www.news.com.au/national-news/victoria/rape-victim-tells-court-i-felt-like-a-hunted-animal/story-fnii5sms-1226683177141

New (21-5-2012)- "Boy-sex man can become citizen"- A confessed serial pedophile from Britain, who repeatedly abused four young boys over a 14-year period, has been cleared for Australian citizenship after a tribunal ruled he was of "good character". The decision was made despite an intelligence report from Washington indicating his credit card, full name, address, phone number and email were used to purchase child pornography over the internet between December 2003 and March 2004. Graham Ernest Taylor's application for citizenship was opposed on character grounds, given his 1996 convictions for eight counts of sexually abusing children aged about 11. Taylor lives on a disability pension in Gunnedah, northern NSW. He appealed against the department's character assessment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, saying he had completed rehabilitation programs in jail and saw a psychiatrist for 18 months after his release in 1999. The tribunal heard the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US had alerted the Australian Federal Police that Taylor's personal details had been used to purchase child pornography over a four-month period. NSW police sought a warrant to search Taylor's home in 2005, but the magistrate declined their request and the investigation was dropped. In his reasons of February 2, AAT deputy president Robin Handley wrote: "Mr Taylor's reputation will probably be forever tainted by the moral opprobrium with which his misconduct is rightly viewed. However . . . I am satisfied that he has reformed and . . . should now be regarded as of good character." Immigration Minister Chris Bowen's office said that the minister was "disappointed" by the tribunal's decision and had "sought further advice on potential options". http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/boy-sex-man-can-become-citizen/story-e6frg6nf-1226361630852

Has been convicted 7 times since 2005 for failing to comply with his reporting conditions. News (6-2-2012)- "Child sex offender jailed again"- Raymond Tetley is a registered child sex offender who has been jailed - again - for failing to report a change of residential address to police. Tetley, a 41-year-old concreter, has now been convicted seven times since 2005 for failing to comply with his reporting conditions. The known sex offender was jailed for eight months in December 2009 for his sixth offence. Now he is back in jail for another offence. Tetley was convicted of a child sex offence in 2000 and was sent to jail. When he was released in September 2005 he was given a notice to report annually to police until 2020. Under the conditions of the Australian National Child (Sex) Offenders Registry, known as ANCOR, a registered offender has numerous obligations to report details such as a change of address, a change of employer, any changes in their physical appearance, the details of any vehicles they own or use, even the clubs of which they become members. The Mackay Magistrate's Court heard on Friday that Tetley went to a South Mackay residence on January 19 looking for his former female partner, was told to leave by the occupants and was then involved in an altercation with two brothers who both suffered minor injuries. One of them fought him off with a walking stick. Police later located Tetley behind a hotel in River St. Inquiries revealed he had no residential address. He had left his Bakers Creek caravan last October without notifying police and then had lived at Alligator Creek for several months without telling authorities. Tetley pleaded guilty to four charges including failing to report as required as a registered sex offender. Magistrate Mark Morrow jailed him for nine months, to be released on parole on April 20. He was given a notice to report annually to police until 2020. http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2012/02/06/jailed-for-seventh-offence-raymond-tetley/|/images/raymond_tetley_2.jpg
BRENDON JAMES THOMAS (VIC- Red Cliffs)|yrs old|Sentenced in May 2011, in the County Court to 3 yrs and 9 months jail - 15 months non-parole.. Sentenced in June 2011 in the Mildura Magistrates Court, to a further 10 months imprisonment, to be served concurrently, for possessing child pornography.|Brendan Thomas - pleaded guilty to 10 charges of being involved in an indecent act with a child under the age of 16. Pleaded guilty to possessing of child pornography News (17-6-2011)- "Paedophile spared: No extra jail time for 161 child pornography images"- A Red Cliffs man already serving prison time for child sex offences has been spared further time behind bars despite pleading guilty to possession of child pornography in the Mildura Magistrates Court. Brendon James Thomas downloaded more than 150 images of child pornography in a three-week period in 2009 and also secretly filmed a nine-year-old girl while she dried her naked body with a towel. Thomas had earlier pleaded guilty in a County Court hearing to 10 charges of being involved in an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 and was last month sentenced to three years and nine months in prison with a minimum term before parole of 15 months. This week he was sentenced to a further 10 months imprisonment, to be served concurrently with the earlier sentence; his release date will remain in August next year. The court was this week told the child pornography allegations were initially linked with the sex offence charges but subsequently became separated as a matter of legal process. Police prosecutor Senior Constable Tansley Hill said police raided Thomas Red Cliffs house in April last year and seized computer equipment containing 161 images of child pornography. Sen-Constable Hill said the images included mostly category one images but also category four  the worst there is. The prosecutor said the images were downloaded by Thomas between May 24 and June 16, 2009 and copied two months later to a disc which has never been recovered. Sen-Constable Hill said Thomas refused to be interviewed by police about secretly filming a nine-year-old girl drying herself with a towel. Defence counsel Florian Andrighetto said the pornography charges came to light with other matters for which he had already been sentenced. In seeking a custodial term to be served concurrently with his existing penalty, Mr Andrighetto said his client was undertaking an accounting course while in prison and would have a job to go to when released. However, Sen-Constable Hill said that while there was no prosecution objection to concurrency, the very serious matters warranted a clear message that offences of that nature against innocent and defenceless children would not be tolerated. http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/paedophile-spared-no-extra-jail-time-for-161-child-pornography-images/2198007.aspx

GEOFFREY NORMAN THOMAS (VIC- Wodonga)|46 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 23-9-2011 ,to 14 months jail - 8 months non-parole.|Geoffrey Thomas - pleaded guilty to an indecent act with a child under 16, and possessing child pornography. Victim was an 8 yr old girl. "Prison for paedophile" (24-9-2011) A Wodonga man who indecently touched an eight-year-old girl and had 750 pornographic images on his laptop computer was yesterday jailed for eight months. Judge Marilyn Harbison said when sentencing Geoffrey Norman Thomas, 46, that his offending has had a profound impact on the victim and her parents. Victim impact statements had been tendered from them expressing their feelings over what happened. Thomas, a part-time spray painter, was described by Judge Harbison as an alcoholic who was drunk when the offences were committed. A forfeiture order was made relating to Thomas computer which had the images. Judge Harbison imposed an overall sentence of 14 months with a non-parole period of eight months. She said without a guilty plea Thomas would have received a 30-month jail term and 18 months to serve. He appeared for sentence after last month pleading guilty to an indecent act with a child under 16 and possessing child pornography. Judge Harbison had previously been told Thomas became friends with a North East family in 2007 regularly visiting their farm and playing with their children. One of the children, a girl, 8, said Thomas touched her inappropriately three times between January 1 and May 1, 2009. The first time Thomas took the girl behind a shed and when she was seated on his lap, he lifted her skirt and had touched her genitals before the girl tried to pull away and ran off. In the second incident, Thomas touched the girl through her underwear and only stopped when her father had come out of the house to find her. The father was told by his daughter on January 6 last year about the incidents and reported them to police the following day. When interviewed by police on January 8, Thomas said he had been tickling the girl. Her skirt rode up, her underwear was partly down and for some stupid reason I touched her vagina. Police found his laptop contained many child pornography images. Thomas told police that he had been visiting pornographic websites for a year. He had saved images but believed that there were few of children under 10. http://www.bordermail.com.au/news/local/news/general/prison-for-paedophile/2302611.aspx

News (1-11-2011)- "Rapist tried dating victims" A deluded sex fiend who tried to persuade victims to go on dates after he raped and sexually abused them was warned yesterday he risked spending a large part of his life in jail. Judge Gabriele Cannon told Tovia Tovia that a psychologist found he had "an elevated risk of re-offending" and the judge believed his chances of rehabilitation to be "bleak". She jailed him in the County Court for 14 years and set a minimum term of 8 1/2 years. Judge Cannon said that Tovia was on parole for another sex attack when he broke into the home of a 22-year-old woman in Melbourne's northwestern suburbs and subjected her to an ordeal that lasted several hours. Despite her tears and pleading Tovia raped the terrified stranger three times at knifepoint, while her 15-year-old sister slept in a nearby room. As she begged him to stop Judge Cannon said Tovia told her she could have his baby and added "It's not like I'm hurting you or anything". After the ordeal was over he asked the victim for her phone number, invited her to a party and a family dinner, left voicemail messages including one that asked if she would let him in if he returned. Judge Cannon said Tovia was deluded and his conduct was "chilling, disturbing and repugnant" and had a devastating effect on the woman who had to give up her job and risked having her car repossessed. Tovia, 26, a New Zealander born in Samoa, pleaded guilty to three counts of rape, one of attempted rape and one of aggravated burglary committed after he broke in to the victim's house through a bathroom window in November 2010. Judge Cannon said at the time Tovia was on parole, having served 18 months of a 39-month term for aggravated burglary and two counts of indecent assault. In that attack in June 2007 Tovia entered the unlocked back door of a woman's house and sexually assaulted her at knifepoint while her three-year-old son slept next door. The next day Tovia returned to her house hoping to persuade the woman to go on a date with him and he was arrested. Judge Cannon said Tovia had a serious drinking problem but her focus had to be on protecting the community rather than his rehabilitation. Tovia, who has been classified as a lifelong serious sexual offender, has to serve the unexpired portion of his sentence for the attack on his first victim before the latest sentence commences. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/rapist-tried-dating-victims/story-fn6bfm6w-1226181850857

Towner bashed Lauren over the head with a rock to stop her screaming as he was raping her then drowned her in the Nepean River. NSW (24-8-2012)- "Killer release scandal"- "Neville Raymond Towner"- Child killer/ Paedophile. Murdered and sexually assaulted 4 yr old girl (Lauren Hickson) at Emu Plains, Western Sydney, in 1989. Towner bashed Lauren over the head with a rock to stop her screaming as he was raping her then drowned her in the Nepean River. A Current Affair- aca.ninemsn.com.au/article/8521666/killer-release-scandal News (19-10-2002)- "Child killer could be released in seven years" One of NSW's most notorious killers could walk free from jail in seven years after a judge yesterday redetermined his life sentence. Neville Raymond Towner, 36, has served 13 years over the sexual assault and murder of four-year-old Lauren Hickson at Emu Plains, in western Sydney, on May 17, 1989. Justice Greg James yesterday redetermined his life sentence, setting a minimum 20-year term, making Towner eligible for parole in 2009. Justice James told the NSW Supreme Court that Towner should have the prospect of release. "Although this crime was horrible, its seriousness, having regard to the views of the trial judges, was not such as to require [Towner] never be released," he said. A family friend and babysitter, Towner, then aged 23, bashed Lauren over the head with a rock to stop her screaming as he was raping her. He then drowned her in the Nepean River. Last Friday would have been Lauren's 18th birthday. A psychiatrist told the court Towner accepted responsibility for his crime and its enormity but had actively sought to forget it. The Crown had argued that his inability to recall the detail of Lauren's ordeal showed he did not fully acknowledge his guilt. Lauren's mother, Jurina Hickson, said child killers should "rot in jail". "I'm scared, I'm scared for my family. He's going to come after us ... we've heard that's why he's desperate to get out," Mrs Hickson said. Towner was jailed under a previous sentencing act in which the worst category of murder attracted a mandatory life sentence. Under the "truth in sentencing" legislation of 1989, some prisoners won the right to have their sentences redetermined. http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/18/1034561315976.html

Timothy Trethewie walked free from the County Court in April on a six-month intensive corrections order, but almost immediately breached the strict conditions by leaving Victoria. Although a warrant was issued for his arrest, Trethewie did not live like a fugitive in his home town. Instead of looking over his shoulder, he made no attempt to hide and claimed the dole at his local Centrelink office. But within three days of the Herald Sun contacting the Corrections Department and Victoria Police, a detective was sent to Tasmania to arrest Trethewie and bring him back to Melbourne. His victim, Carole (not her real name), was angry her attacker was not jailed and furious he fled. Carole said she was told it was unlikely Trethewie, 36, would be extradited back to Victoria because he did not receive a jail term. "I find it very strange that they suddenly get their bums into gear after I spoke to the media about my case," she said. She believes the rape was treated less seriously because her attacker was a former boyfriend. Trethewie pleaded guilty to rape in April and County Court Judge Jane Campton sentenced him. The maximum penalty for rape is 25 years. After evading jail, Trethewie attended just one ICO appointment and was reported for breaching the conditions of his ICO. Carole is distraught and disappointed with the legal system. "I've lost all faith in the legal system, the courts, the police . . ." she said. "I was always under the impression rape is a very, very serious thing. If you commit a crime like that you go to prison." - Herald Sun

Pleading guilty to 5 charges-2 counts of using a carriage service to procure a child under 16 to perform a sexual act, 2 counts of making child exploitation material and 1 count of possessing child exploitation material. News (18-8-2011)- "Former teacher and coach gets suspended jail term for enticing girls to send sex photos" A former high school teacher and prominent athletics coach has avoided jail despite enticing two promising 15-year-old athletes to send him sexually provocative photos of themselves via the internet or mobile phone. Former Sarina State High School teacher David Trudgian, 40, was sentenced to a wholly suspended 18-month jail term after pleading guilty in the Brisbane District Court to five charges, including using the internet to procure the two elite child athletes to perform sex acts. The court was told the then central Queensland-based teacher and respected athletics coach met the girls, who attended a separate high school in another northern area, during a series of elite athletic tournaments between October and December 2007. Prosecutor Dennis Kinsella said Trudgian, then aged 37, was a prominent sprint coach who began giving the pair advice after tournaments in Townsville and at Brisbane's state and Sydney's national athletic championships. He said while Trudgian did not coach the girls, he offered to give them advice to help them fulfil their sporting aspirations. However, the court was told that relationship soured when internet and mobile phone text message communications spiralled downward from "innocent through to flirtation to sexually explicit." Mr Kinsella said Trudgian sent the girls a total of 2384 mobile phone text messages - including requests they pose nude and send him naked photographs of themselves between September 30, 2007, and February 1, 2008. He said Trudgian received 11 images - deemed to be child exploitation - from the girls, and that all of them could be found "intact" or recovered after being deleted from the teacher's phone or computer. The court was told police found the offensive images after searching his home after one of the girl's revealed what happened to one of her school teachers. Mr Kinsella said Trudgian moved to live in Melbourne in the wake of the police investigation. Trudgian originally pleaded guilty in early July to two counts of using a carriage service, meaning the internet or phone, to procure a child under 16 to perform a sexual act, two counts of making child exploitation material and one count of possessing child exploitation material. Barrister Dan O'Gorman, SC, for Trudgian, said both his client's teaching and coaching careers were ruined as a result of these offences and that Trudgian was now engaged as a full-time house dad to his one-year-old daughter. He said Trudgian and his heavily pregnant wife continue to live in Melbourne and are expecting the birth of their second child in two months. "What he (Trudgian) engaged in (with these girls) was stupid flirting that got out of control," Mr O'Gorman said. Judge Hugh Botting, in sentencing Trudgian, said: "These are ... serious offences and have had serious consequences for these two girls." "It is difficult to understand ... why you committed these offences." Judge Botting ordered Trudgian's prison term be wholly suspended for three years. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/former-teacher-and-coach-gets-suspended-jail-term-for-enticing-girls-to-send-sex-photos/story-e6freoof-1226117543989

"Abuse claim against Geelong Grammar" (3-7-2011) An exclusive Victorian school faces a damages claim over the alleged sexual molestation of a student more than 20 years ago. A former schoolboy has launched County Court action seeking exemplary damages against Geelong Grammar School. In a claim lodged with the court, the victim (whom the Sunday Herald Sun has decided not to name) claims to have been molested in 1989 by Philip Trutmann, who allegedly was a boarding house assistant at the Grammar's Highton, Geelong, campus at the time of the alleged offence. The court document claimed the school was responsible for the actions of the alleged attacker and when told of the alleged offences, failed to support or rehabilitate the victim. Mr Trutmann has not yet filed a defence to the claim and could not be contacted. A Geelong Grammar spokesman said no one was available to comment. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/abuse-claim-against-geelong-grammar/story-e6freon6-1226086287923 "Ex-Geelong Grammar staffer gets 6 years" (14-12-2005) A former Geelong Grammar staff member who sexually abused more than 40 male students between 1985 and 1995 was sentenced to 6 years' jail yesterday. Phillipe Trutmann, 44, of Lal Lal, will serve at least 3 years before he is eligible for parole and will be listed on a sexual offenders register for the next 15 years. In the Geelong County Court yesterday Judge John Smallwood said Trutmann was a "serious sexual offender" whose crimes against eight to 13-year-old boys ranged "over a very long period when clearly you knew it was wrong". "These took place against very young, totally defenceless children," Judge Smallwood said. http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/exgeelong-grammar-staffer-gets-6189-years/2005/12/13/1134236064292.html|/images/phil_trutmann_1.jpg
IAN WAYNE TUCKER (VIC)|54 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 15 months jail.|Ian Wayne Tucker/ former Victorian school teacher. Was a member of internet paedophile ring. had more than 16,000 sexually explicit pictures and pornographic videos of young children on his computer when it was seized by police. News (1-6-2009)- "Pedophile jail terms 'too light'" Australia's child pornography laws have been shown to be lenient, with US members of an internet pedophile ring jailed for life while its Townsville-based co-founder launches an appeal against his non-parole sentence of 32 months. Former Australia Post human resources regional manager Derek Richard Mara, 30, will next month fight to have his commonwealth jail term cut after he was convicted as one of the four founding members of the internet's oldest known pedophile ring, The Group, which financed made-to-order abuse movies and picture shoots of children, some just a few months old. Mara - who carried the moniker of "Tech" - provided computer expertise to encrypt and hide hundreds of thousands of files of the material sold and shared around the world. An investigation led by Queensland's Taskforce Argos and involving Interpol and the FBI infiltrated the ring in 2006, and last year arrested 22 core members and identified another 2500 customers of child-sex websites in 20 countries. More than 40 children identified in the images were rescued from abuse during the investigation. In recent months, The Australian has found that most of the 12 Americans convicted for their involvement in The Group have been sentenced to more than 30 years in jail for offences similar to those that Mara pleaded guilty to last year. Five Americans were given life, and another was sentenced to 70 years after he was also convicted of abusing a child and recording it on film. Other members of The Group, convicted in Europe, have received sentences of up to life in prison. Mara - who was also charged with indecent treatment of a child - was sentenced to six years in jail, with a non-parole period of 32 months after pleading guilty to three counts of sending and receiving pedophile images. It is believed to be the longest sentence given under commonwealth law for the offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years for producing, possessing or supplying child pornography. Child welfare expert Chris Goddard, who heads Monash University's Child Abuse Prevention Research Australia, said the states and commonwealth were lenient on those who traded in pedophile material. "Child abuse sentencing in Australia is soft in comparison with the rest of the world," Professor Goddard said. "The sentencing does not reflect the seriousness of the crime or the damage done. "One of the problems is the language - we call it child pornography, which gives a sense of consent. But these offenders are hiring people to grossly exploit and commit criminal acts against children. "We need to review the inadequate sentencing provisions." One other Australian, former Victorian schoolteacher Ian Wayne Tucker, 51, who was convicted as a member of The Group, was sentenced to 15months in jail. He had more than 16,000 sexually explicit pictures and pornographic videos of young children on his computer when it was seized by police.
RONALD LOUIS TUCKWELL  (SA- Hoyleton)|78 yrs old-2012|Sentenced in June 2008, to 10 yrs jail - 6 yrs non parole.|Ronald Tuckwell- Paedophile. Repeat Offender. News (2-4-2009)- "Pedophile gets extra jail time" Former community leader and convicted pedophile Ronald Louis Tuckwell has been ordered to serve another year in jail for sex offences. The sentence, imposed by the Adelaide Magistrates Court today, means Tuckwell will not be eligible for parole until he is 81. Tuckwell, 75, of Hoyleton, pleaded guilty to four counts of indecent assault, all against different victims aged 13 and under between 1960 and 1977. Magistrate Terrence Forrest told the court two of the offences had occurred "within a day or similar short period of the parents of the victim having separated." "Obviously the victims were in a position of considerable vulnerability," Mr Forrest said. "The offending you have engaged in has enourmous effects on its victims." He said Tuckwell had been shamed by the public knowing about his offences. "It has been put that you have suffered the shame and harm of your conduct having been exposed in more recent times." But he said the victim's experiences in re-telling what had happened to them to police officers was stressful. "That you have suffered a degree of harm will be of little comfort for your victims," he told the court. Mr Forrest said Tuckwell had not committed any offence since 1981, and imposed one sentence for the four counts of indecent assault. Tuckwell was sentenced in the District Court in June last year to 10 years in prison with a non-parole period of six years for five counts of unlawful sexual intercourse and four counts of indecent assault in the 1970s and 1980s. Another 12-month sentence with a non-parole period of three months was imposed on Tuckwell in the District Court in November last year for one count of indecent assault in 1961. Magistrate Forrest further extended Tuckwell's jail term by 27 months and ordered his six-year non-parole period be extended by 12 months. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/pedophile-gets-extra-jail-time/story-e6freo8c-1225698128249

News (18-8-2011)- "Man guilty of Marketown sex attack on 7-year-old"- A sexual predator who molested a seven-year-old girl in a Marketown Shopping Centre toilet block was suspected of carrying out a similar attack weeks earlier, court documents revealed. Police recognised Robert Jason Turnbull immediately when they viewed security camera footage from a nearby shop on February 2, a police statement said. One officer informed his colleagues that Turnbull was a suspect in a similar attack at the Newcastle West shopping centre on January 13, prompting detectives to arrest Turnbull at his Fowler Street, Hamilton South, home within minutes. Turnbull, 38, pleaded guilty in Newcastle Local Court yesterday to two counts of indecent assault and will face Newcastle District Court next week. He has a criminal record for sexual abuse and has been refused bail since his capture, court documents stated. The girl was at the shopping centre with her mother on February 2 when she ran to the toilet block on the Parry Street side of the building. She was in the women's toilets when she noticed Turnbull peering over the toilet door at her and looking at her through a gap between the door and the stall. Turnbull told the girl to let him in because he needed to fix something, but once inside he locked the door and told her to pull her skirt down. She didn't so Turnbull did before assaulting her twice. A witness in the stall beside them became suspicious when she heard Turnbull say, "Be quiet or I'll kill you" and the girl say "I don't like what you're doing to me". The witness said, "What's going on," and then came out of her stall to see the victim standing there upset. She took the girl to her mother and they went to centre management, where police were called. Turnbull denied being at the shopping centre, but police found a matching palm print on one of the toilet doors. http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/man-guilty-of-marketown-sex-attack-on-7yearold/2262153.aspx News (24-2-2011) - Robert Jason Turnbull,of Fowler Street, Hamilton South, appeared in court charged with aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, attempted sexual intercourse with a child, and assault with intent to have sexual intercourse with child. http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/man-refused-bail-over-alleged-indecent-assault/2085964.aspx

There are seven declared dangerous criminals in Tasmania, being mostly child abusers and serial rapists.

The Supreme Court in 2003 refused a prosecution application to declare child sex abuser Anthony John Minney, of Launceston, a dangerous criminal, yet he was jailed last September for 14 months after pleading guilty to loitering near children. Minney has a long history of sexually assaulting children and last year asked police to send him to prison. In 2003 Justice Ewan Crawford said Minney's child sex abuse case was ``not sufficiently exceptional'' to justify making a dangerous criminal order. "Seven people (declared dangerous) across the whole of Tasmania does not seem to indicate they are using the tool at their disposal enough, '' Mr Fisher said. "The dangerous criminal register was brought in to serve a purpose and that's to do exactly that to keep them off the street.''

Michael Binns, 51, downloaded the images between May 17, 2007, and November 15, 2008. Sentencing him at the Supreme Court in Launceston today, Chief Justice Ewan Crawford referred to his conviction in 1999 on three sexual assault and indecent assault convictions relating to the abuse of two 11-year-old girls. "The present offences demonstrate that his sexual proclivity for young girls remains and that a sentence of personal deterrence is required,'' Justice Crawford said. Justice Crawford said while 394 of the images were classed at the lowest end of the scale for child exploitation material, most were still very sexually explicit. The photographs featured about 300 girls aged between three and 15. "The girls in the images are to be regarded as victims of the accused and his kind,'' he said. Binns will serve three months' imprisonment for using a carriage service for child pornography material and a further six months for possessing child exploitation material. His name will be placed on the child sex offender registry for five years. http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/general/child-molester-jailed-for-porn-images/2357643.aspx

Buddle was placed on the sex offenders' register for five years on his release from jail. Yesterday, Buddle's defence lawyer Kate Cuthbertson said the sentence was manifestly excessive. Ms Cuthbertson said her client was remorseful for his actions and had empathy for the children depicted in child pornography images. She outlined several local cases where offenders received similar sentences for crimes which, she said, appeared more serious than Buddle's. Ms Cuthbertson said Buddle had never been married and had been attracted to young boys since adolescence. He had never acted on his impulses in a physical sense and had been careful not to be left alone with boys, she said. He had quit his job as a GP when he was charged with the offence, causing a dramatic loss in income and reputation. "The impact on his life and profession has been very significant," Ms Cuthbertson said. Crown prosecutor Ian Arendt said although Buddle's crimes were not at the upper end of the scale of seriousness they were nevertheless very serious and about halfway there. Mr Arendt said Buddle had accessed pornography on a nearly daily basis over a four-year period. Chief Justice Ewan Crawford said Buddle's offending had been consistent. "It is hard to believe people who claim remorse when they have been offending every day for a number of years," Justice Crawford said. Justice Crawford, Justice Alan Blow and Justice David Porter reserved their decision. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/08/10/252031_tasmania-news.html
MARCUS PAUL CHERRY (TAS- Blackmans Bay)|34 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in September 2011, in the Supreme Court in Hobart, to 11 months jail.|Marcus Cherry - Pleaded guilty to 3 child pornography charges- had 17,897 different still images and 67 videos depicting child pornography when police raided his home in June 2010. News (9-9-2011)- "Man jailed for child porn"- A BLACKMANS Bay man has been jailed for 11 months after pleading guilty to three child pornography charges. The Supreme Court in Hobart heard yesterday that Marcus Paul Cherry, 34, had 17,897 different still images and 67 videos depicting child pornography when police raided his home in June last year. In sentencing, Chief Justice Ewan Crawford told the court Cherry was a pedophile with recurrent fantasies and sexual urges toward pre-pubescent girls. "Like many others charged with such crimes, he has lived a relatively lonely life and spent much of his recent years in his room with a computer," Justice Crawford said. "There is no suggestion that he has ever acted on his attraction to girls." The court also heard that Cherry had been prescribed anti-depressent medication which had been successful in lowering his sex-drive but he had stopped taking the medication. After being caught, Cherry had volunteered to have psychological treatment, which had slightly reduced the risk of him committing sexual offences. Cherry was sentenced to 11 months for possession and eight months for using a carriage service for child pornography material, both sentences are to be served concurrently. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/09/09/259991_tasmania-news.html

Man admits child-sex offences- (25-7-2012) A 60-YEAR-OLD Hobart man has been remanded in custody after pleading guilty to two counts of maintaining a sexual relationship with a person under the age of 17. The crimes occurred more than 30 years ago. Car salesman Jervis Mitchell Holloway yesterday faced court over a string of sex acts he performed with two young men between 1978 and 1982. The complainants were 14 and 16. Both from sheltered Seventh Day Adventist families, the teens had no sexual experience before their relationships with Holloway who was a decade older than them. Both teenagers were impressed by the lifestyle of alcohol, parties and go-cart racing Holloway offered. The accused, then aged 26, came across his first victim when driving along the Channel Highway. The teen had been dropped off on the side of the road by his mother after an argument and was hitch-hiking. The accused spotted the 16-year-old and offered to take care of him. Later that day Holloway initiated a sexual act in his bedroom and the inexperienced victim complied. The court heard the pair engaged in regular sex acts over the next three years. Defence lawyer David Gunson SC said the pair had maintained a close relationship until the complainant went to police last year. The second teen had been introduced to Holloway by the first complainant and participated in a sexual relationship. "These boys lacked maturity, that naivety would have been something the accused could have quite readily taken advantage of," prosecutor Linda Mason told the court. Mr Gunson said his client had led an industrious life and emphasised both teens had been willing participants aside from being under-age. Justice David Porter will pass sentence on August 7. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/07/25/349241_scalesofjustice.html

"When you and your companion first met up with the girl and her mother in the street, you punched the child to the face," Justice Blow said. "The child began crying and screaming. "As you all walked along, you kicked the child repeatedly from behind. "You were kicking her to her buttocks and to her lower back area." Justice Blow said the girl had been placed in the custody of the state since the incident. Her mother had moved interstate. "Although the child did not suffer much physical harm as a result of your assault, the psychological effects of the assault and other ill-treatment, which I do not blame on you, seem to have been enormous," Justice Blow said. "But, most significantly, this was a terrible assault on a defenceless child. "I think imprisonment is the only appropriate penalty."

Ex-bus driver's child porn guilt (1-9-2011) A FORMER school bus driver has pleaded guilty to storing child exploitation material on his computer. Russell Robert Langfield, 53, of Kimberley, had his internet usage tracked by a Queensland Police taskforce that was investigating a child pornography website before his computer was seized by Tasmania Police in September last year. It was found to contain 307 photos and 16 video files categorised as child exploitation material which were stored in files with names such as "bus folder" and "schoolies". He told the police at the time that he considered the images, mostly low-level pornography of children posing, as "artistic" not pornographic. Langfield's defence counsel Tamara Jago said most of the images did not involve sexual activity. Ms Jago said Langfield had an interest in adult pornography and the amount of material he downloaded which offended the law was very small. She said Langfield, an organic farmer, was now in a relationship and had lost his interest in porn. "He is ashamed and embarrassed by the charges," she said. Langfield is no longer employed as a school bus driver. He will be sentenced on September 7. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/09/01/258135_scalesofjustice.html

"She made an immediate complaint," Justice Wood said. "She was shaking and hysterical." Lewis's lawyer Craig Rainbird had asked Justice Wood to consider a suspended sentence. However, Justice Wood said the crime was disturbing and one the complainant would struggle to cope with. She said it was necessary to impose a sentence as a general deterrent. Justice Wood sentenced Lewis to 15 months in jail, backdated to July 20, when he was first arrested. He will be eligible for parole in March. His name will be put on a sex offenders' register and he must report to authorities for eight years. http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/08/31/257701_scalesofjustice.html

Anthony John Minney has been sentenced to 14 months in prison, after he pleaded guilty to loitering near children in May. The 35-year-old was arrested outside the Door of Hope church in Launceston, near three children who were playing under the supervision of an adult. Magistrate Robert Pearce told the court Minney is a paranoid schizophrenic and is a high risk of reoffending. He was jailed for two and a half years in 2003 for indecently assaulting a nine-year-old girl and received a suspended sentence when he was convicted of loitering near children last year. Mr Pearce ordered him to serve two months of the suspended sentence and imposed another 12 months.   http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-13/20110913-sex-offender-requests-jail/2882712    News (22-6-2011)- "Sex offender on loitering charge" A Convicted Launceston sex offender has been remanded in custody after allegedly being caught loitering near children.

Those indecent assaults occurred in 2001 when Minney molested a 10-year-old girl at George Town and a nine-year-old girl in Launceston.

Opposition justice spokeswoman Vanessa Goodwin said Tasmanian children deserved better protection. "It is extremely disturbing to read reports that a man with a history of sexual offending has received a suspended prison sentence, in spite of a psychologist's report confirming that there is a substantial risk that the man will reoffend," Ms Goodwin said. Anthony John Minney, 34, received the suspended two-month sentence in the Launceston Magistrates Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to loitering near children. Ms Goodwin said he could not be required to participate in a sex offender treatment program because there were none for community-based offenders.

ANDY MUIRHEAD (TAS- Hobart)|36 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Andy Muirhead/ Former ABC television host- Pleaded guilty to child pornography offences. Andy Muirhead in custody on child pornography charges- (31-7-2012) The former ABC television host Andy Muirhead is being held in custody tonight after pleading guilty to accessing child pornography on his home computer. The police found more than 12,000 images of child pornography and 24 videos on Muirhead's computer when they searched his Hobart home in 2010. The former host of Collectors has written a letter apologising for his actions, saying the things he saw were vile and disgusting. Felicity Ogilvie reports from the Supreme Court in Hobart, and a warning, this story contains descriptions of child abuse. Andy Muirhead's lawyer describes her client's fall from grace as significant. The 36-year-old Tasmanian has gone from presenting the national TV show Collectors and hosting breakfast radio on the ABC in Hobart, to pleading guilty to child pornography charges. The prosecution says the pornography Muirhead accessed involved children as young as three years old. Of the more than 12,000 images that were found of Muirhead's home computer the majority were of children, who were often naked, posing erotically. The prosecution rated the severity of the images, saying there were also hundreds of photos of girls and boys engaged in sexual acts with other children and adults. The worst rating went to the 62 images that Muirhead had accessed of children being treated sadistically and images of bestiality and bondage. The prosecutor, Maitland Lincoln, told the court that Muirhead was a regular and consistent user of child pornography and downloaded it almost daily. He said that in one of the images a child appeared to be crying. The court heard that the Australian Police were first alerted to Muirhead's activities by Interpol in Luxembourg after Muirhead downloaded four images in May of 2009. The Federal Police then watched Muirhead for more than a year before arresting him in June 2010. A sample of the images that Muirhead had accessed were then shown to the court. Most of Andy Muirhead's family and friends left the court when the images were shown. Journalists who remained in court said that Muirhead looked down and cried while the pictures were shown. Later, Andy Muirheads defence lawyer Kim Baumeler described how the former ABC TV and local radio host is unlikely to be employed in the industry again. She said he had been largely unemployed since being arrested two years ago and has moved back in with his parents. She read a letter to the court that Muirhead had written. He apologised for his actions saying what he did was shameful, reckless and stupid. The former TV host also said the things he saw on his computer were vile and disgusting and he said that he couldn't imagine how much hurt had been caused to the people depicted in those images. His lawyer, Kim Baumeler, told the court that Muirhead has been getting counselling and seeing a psychologist since his arrest and that he has the support of his family and friends. The maximum sentence for the crimes of accessing child pornography and possessing child exploitation material are between 10 to 21 years jail. The judge has remanded Muirhead in custody and plans to sentence him in two weeks time. http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2012/s3557695.htm Former ABC host Muirhead pleads guilty to child porn- (31-7-2012) FORMER ABC presenter Andy Muirhead has pleaded guilty to three charges relating to child pornography in the Tasmanian Supreme Court. The court has been told that Muirhead used peer-to-peer software to access more than 12,000 picture files and 24 videos. Prosecutor Maitland Lincoln said Muirhead had changed software after reading articles about a child pornography ring busted by police in May 2010. The ages of children depicted ranged from three to 14 and at least 60 were in the worst category, showing the explicit or sadistic treatment of children. Muirhead looked down as graphic examples of the images and videos were played to the court. He had previously pleaded not guilty to the charges. His plea hearing is set to continue this afternoon. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/former-abc-host-muirhead-pleads-guilty-to-child-porn/story-e6frea6u-1226439355701|/images/andy_muirhead_2.jpg

Priors in 1984- abduction/ rape of a young woman in ACT- 7 yrs- released in 1988/ 1988- 3 yrs jail (attacked a woman). The prosecution is trying to have Phillips declared a dangerous criminal by the courts- Which means he can be held in custody indefinitely.  News (26-3-2012)- "Worst criminals able to reoffend" SOME of Tasmania's worst criminals are reoffending after the court refuses to declare them dangerous criminals a classification that gives judges the power to jail them indefinitely. There are seven declared dangerous criminals in Tasmania, being mostly child abusers and serial rapists. Beyond Abuse spokesman Steve Fisher said it appeared either the Director of Public Prosecutions was not making enough dangerous prisoner applications to the court or the court was rejecting too many. The Supreme Court in 2003 refused a prosecution application to declare child sex abuser Anthony John Minney, of Launceston, a dangerous criminal, yet he was jailed last September for 14 months after pleading guilty to loitering near children. Minney has a long history of sexually assaulting children and last year asked police to send him to prison. In 2003 Justice Ewan Crawford said Minney's child sex abuse case was ``not sufficiently exceptional" to justify making a dangerous criminal order. "Seven people (declared dangerous) across the whole of Tasmania does not seem to indicate they are using the tool at their disposal enough," Mr Fisher said. "The dangerous criminal register was brought in to serve a purpose and that's to do exactly that to keep them off the street." Late last year convicted serial rapist Kevin Richard Bell failed in his bid to have his dangerous criminal order overturned. Bell was sentenced to 12 years' jail in 1991 for six rapes, one indecent assault and four counts of defilement of a young girl. Six months after being paroled in 1998, he committed sex offences against children aged three and 16. Rocherlea man Brendan James Freeman was declared a dangerous criminal in 2004 and sentenced to seven years' jail after admitting to raping and bashing a woman in Launceston. Colin John Sparkes (1997) was also placed on the list after being convicted of burglary with intent to rape. Other criminals the DPP has applied to have placed on the dangerous criminal register include Ian John Brumby (2002) who had committed assault, robbery and rape, and serial rapist Paul Vincent Phillips (1998).http://www.theadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/worst-criminals-able-to-reoffend/2500119.aspx ABC Premium News (11-12-2006)- "Rapist To Be Allowed Day Releases"- The Tasmanian Parole Board has recommended that twice-convicted rapist Paul Vincent Phillips be allowed out of jail on day releases. Phillips has served eight years of a 10-year sentence for the abduction and rape of a hitchhiker at Cygnet. The board turned down his application for parole because he had not had any day releases. In October, the Director of Public Prosecutions failed to have Phillips jailed indefinitely as a dangerous criminal. Phillips can re-apply for parole in three months.

Six months' jail for child porn viewer (4-5-2012) A George Town man who viewed tens of thousands of child pornography images and stories has been jailed for six months. Kevin Charles Rose, 46, pleaded guilty yesterday to two counts of using a carriage service to access child exploitation material and one count of possessing child exploitation material. Rose looked at child porn for about an hour a day for three years before police searched his home on December 20, 2011. He used the guest account on his laptop to access child porn, and opened 6248 websites in the two months before his arrest. Rose also downloaded a small selection of images and pornographic stories on to a USB stick every few days and viewed them several times before deleting them. Sentencing him in the Supreme Court in Launceston yesterday, Justice Peter Evans said the crime was serious because of the sheer volume of images Rose had viewed in the three years. "Largely because of the very substantial number of children who must have been exploited in the process of the creation of the many images accessed by the defendant, I consider that an immediately effective sentence of imprisonment is necessary," he said. Justice Evans said he did not believe Rose's claim that he was not sexually gratified by the child exploitation material. Rose will be placed on the sex offenders register for five years from his release from custody. http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/crime-and-law/six-months-jail-for-child-porn-viewer/2544916.aspx Child porn man pleads guilty (4-5-2012) FORMER George Town man Kevin Charles Rose spent an hour a day looking at child pornography before his arrest in December 2011, a Launceston court has heard. The 46-year-old pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court in Launceston yesterday to two counts of using a carriage service to access child exploitation material and one count of possessing child exploitation material. Rose, who now lives in North-West Tasmania, accessed child porn using a computer and then a laptop at his George Town home from December 20, 2008, to his arrest on December 20, 2011. He told police he saved ``about 4 per cent'' of the photos and explicit stories he viewed on to a USB drive every few days and looked at them a few times over a couple of days before deleting them. He downloaded the most recent batch the night before police searched his home. Crown prosecutor Elizabeth Curtis said based on Rose's admissions it could be conservatively estimated that he accessed 150 images each day and had accessed tens of thousands of child pornography images over three years.http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/general/child-porn-man-pleads-guilty/2544293.aspx

Attacked 3 women during a sexual assault rampage in Feb 2002. One victim had her head repeatedly smashed into the footpath. Update- News (17-11-2010)- "Rapist flown back to Launceston in handcuffs"- CONVICTED rapist Mark Andrew Sinclair was yesterday escorted through Launceston Airport in handcuffs after being extradited from South Australia. The former Ravenswood resident, 35, was accompanied by Launceston detectives Darren Turner and Jason Savage, who flew to Adelaide on Monday to pick up the gym instructor. Sinclair is alleged to have breached his parole by leaving Tasmania in March. He was released from prison in September last year after serving eight years for a rampage that saw him attack three women in less than three hours in February 2002. Then 27, he first grabbed a young woman and dragged her backwards through Yorktown Square, then attacked a 65-year-old woman at Newstead with a one-metre piece of wood, before raping a severely disabled woman, also at Newstead. In between the attacks he was discovered outside a girls' dormitory at the Scotch Oakburn College boarding house but fled after he was confronted. It is understood Sinclair's parole conditions banned him from leaving Tasmania and he allegedly did so despite being refused permission to move to South Australia. It is also understood he has a child in South Australia and had become a grandfather, which prompted his decision to leave. After walking Sinclair through Launceston Airport to a waiting police car yesterday, detective senior constables Turner and Savage confirmed Sinclair had not opposed extradition in an Adelaide court yesterday. "He understands he has done the wrong thing and appears to want to serve out the rest of his sentence so he can get on with his life," Detective Senior Constable Turner said. Sinclair will be released later next year. http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/crime-and-law/rapist-flown-back-to-launceston-in-handcuffs/1999155.aspx  http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/crime-and-law/infamous-launceston-rapist-to-be-extradited/1997993.aspx|/images/mark_sinclair_2.jpg

News (9-12-2011)- "Molester filmed girl- sex acts"- A LAUNCESTON man filmed himself sexually assaulting a seven-year-old girl at a church group and emailed it overseas to child pornographers, the Supreme Court in Launceston heard yesterday. Christopher John Wright, 31, of Granville St pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent assault and three counts of committing indecent acts with a person under 17 years old in February and April last year. He also pleaded guilty to a total of 10 counts of accessing, producing and possession of child exploitation material. Wright admitted to police that he was sexually aroused by the girl and by children. Crown prosecutor John Ransom said other parishioners were in the next room when the assaults took place. He filmed the act on his iPhone and emailed it to two friends. Commonwealth prosecutor Ian Arendt said Wright had come to the attention of the FBI in the US who contacted the Australian Federal Police. When AFP searched the home he shared with his parents they found 2543 images and 206 videos involving children. There were 16 images and seven videos, classed at level 5, the highest level. Wright sat in the dock staring at the floor when a sample of the images and videos were shown to Chief Justice Ewan Crawford. Mr Arendt told the court Wright had been looking at child pornography for at least 10 years. "He was actively sharing, trading and exchanging child pornography from 36 email addresses with people in many countries including the UK, France and Germany," he said. Defence counsel Adrian Hall said that the indecent acts were of short duration and his guilty plea had saved the girl from giving evidence in court. "He has been shunned by the church," he said. Wright had been molested at the age of six but no charges arose. Mr Hall said Wright had been seeing a psychiatrist because he thought his accessing of pornography was getting out of control.

Reginald Robert Young, who turned 20 on Thursday, was remanded in custody after entering the plea in the Supreme Court in Launceston yesterday. The court heard Young sent the girl a ``poke'' on the social networking site in March last year. "She didn't know who he was but she poked him back,'' crown prosecutor Peter Sheriff said. ``A few days later she received a friend request.'' Mr Sheriff said the pair exchanged messages on Facebook and by SMS for several weeks and Young asked the girl to be his girlfriend. In May last year they met in the car park of Chickenfeed at George Town. On a second meeting they had sex in the back of Young's car in a beach car park, then performed other sexual acts in the women's cubicle of a public toilet block. Mr Sheriff said that the girl ended the relationship the next day but Young continued to send her text messages. Young also pleaded guilty yesterday to a separate count of aggravated sexual assault for digitally raping a 12-year-old girl in 2010, committing an indecent act directed at a young person, and child pornography charges. He knew the 12-year-old girl through a family friend and sent her a text message that said he loved her and wanted to be with her. "The complainant informed the accused that she was 12 years old and he was too old for her," Mr Sheriff said. He said that Young arranged to meet the girl, who was then in grade six, after school in Launceston on April 10, 2010. He said that Young lifted the girl up and carried her to a public toilet where he sexually assaulted her in one of the cubicles. "The complainant's friend then went into the adjacent cubicle and heard the complainant saying, `stop it, stop it'," Mr Sheriff said. Young's lawyer, Tamara Jago, said that he maintained the girl walked with him to the toilet block. He was arrested after police searched his family home at Mount Direction on June 14 last year. The search uncovered child exploitation images and videos, including 27 images and videos of the 14-year-old and two other teenage girls from the Launceston area. http://www.examiner.com.au/story/430436/man-pleads-guilty-in-facebook-sexual-assault-case/  Search MAKO/ Files Online You can search offenders alphabetically by 'Surname'or by 'State/Territory'.A B C D E F G H I-J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W-Z ACT NSW NT QLD SA TAS VIC WA MAKO/Files- WITHIN THE CHURCH FEMALE OFFENDERS MAKO/Files Online..

MATTHEW JAMES VERNON (Matthew Vernon) (VIC- Ballarat East)|35 yrs old - 2013|Sentenced 1-11-2007, in the County Court in Ballarat, to 6.5 yrs jail - 5 yrs non parole.|Matthew James Vernon - Pleaded guilty in 2007, in the Ballarat County Court, to four counts of sexual penetration of a girl under 16.. Victim was an 11 yr old girl. The mother of a girl who gave birth at 12 after being raped by her babysitter has warned other parents to beware of predators posing as friends. The woman told how her daughter was barely coping with the "emotional tragedy". And she issued a chilling warning to all parents to be wary of anyone taking a special interest in their children. "Rape victim's mum warns of friends" (30-9-2007) -below. "Prison for babysitter" (2-11-2007) A Ballarat man who got an 11-year-old he was babysitting pregnant was yesterday jailed for a minimum of five years. Matthew James Vernon, 29, had sex with the girl on two occasions while baby-sitting at the family home, the County Court in Ballarat heard. The girl's teachers and mother noticed a change to her body shape and she gave birth at just 12 years of age. Outside court the girl's mother said the family now had to look towards the future."I'm just so glad that it's all over now, that we can get on with our lives and put an end to that horrific situation," she said. "Nobody else is going to get hurt by him."The woman described finding out her daughter was pregnant as a "bombshell".She said the family would always support the girl and give her the opportunity to be a teenager. Her daughter now aged 14 said she thought Vernon should have received a longer sentence. "It's changed my life totally," she said. "It's been really stressful but I've got though it."The girl said she would now be able to walk down the streets without feeling scared. "I'm glad that he's gone," she said. The girl's mother urged any children in similar circumstances to come forward and tell someone. Judge Margaret Rizkalla said Vernon had betrayed the trust of the girl's family who had incorporated the baby into their lives. "Her mother has taken on the mothering role," she said. "Their lives have been completely turned around."Judge Rizkalla said the girl was "torn between the world of being a mother and being a child of 14".She said Vernon was emotionally immature, had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had also been diagnosed with depression. The court heard Vernon was now in a stable relationship and had fathered another baby.Defence lawyer Helen Spowart said Vernon had become suicidal while in custody and feared for his safety from other prisoners. Vernon pleaded guilty to three counts of digital penetration and one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16. He was convicted and sentenced to six and a half years in jail with a minimum non parole period of five years. http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/597275/prison-for-babysitter/ "Rape victim's mum warns of friends" (30-9-2007) The mother of a girl who gave birth at 12 after being raped by her babysitter has warned other parents to beware of predators posing as friends. The woman told how her daughter was barely coping with the "emotional tragedy". And she issued a chilling warning to all parents to be wary of anyone taking a special interest in their children. Matthew James Vernon, 29, pleaded guilty in Ballarat County Court this month to four counts of sexual penetration of a girl under 16. Vernon, of Ballarat East, had sex with the girl at least twice while babysitting at her home. It was alleged he began the relationship with the girl when she was only 11 and even violated her while her mother was in the garden. The girl's pregnancy was confirmed with a home test after her mother and teachers had noticed changes in her body shape. She then named Vernon as the father and DNA tests confirmed his paternity. The girl's parents are now helping her to bring up the baby. But her mother said the girl was torn between wanting to be a mother and not losing her childhood. "She's bottling it up and then explodes," she said. The woman said that no parents could afford to be complacent over their children's welfare - even with so-called friends. "Just be wary of them," she said. "If they take a special interest in one person, particularly a girl, just be careful. "I don't want anyone else to go through the hell we've been through." Vernon will be sentenced at a date to be fixed. His defence counsel admitted that prison was the only appropriate punishment for him. http://m.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/dont-trust-your-mates/story-e6frf7kx-1111114532291 "Girl, 12, has babysitter's child" (20-9-2007) A 12-year-old schoolgirl gave birth to her babysitter's child, a court has heard. Matthew Vernon, 29, of Ballarat East, had sex with the girl at least twice while babysitting at her home. He was charged after the girl named him as the father following a home pregnancy test. Her mother and teachers had already noticed changes to her body shape. Vernon yesterday pleaded guilty at the County Court in Ballarat to four counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16 - a crime punishable by up to 15 years behind bars. Outside court, the girl's devastated mother expressed relief the legal process was drawing to an end. She said her daughter was barely coping with an "emotional tragedy", causing conflict within the family. "She's coping up to a point," the mother said. "She's not having counselling, which is very hard. She's bottling it up and then explodes; her anger comes out towards me." The woman said her daughter was also torn between wanting to be a mother and a child. "(The baby) calls me mum, which hurts (my daughter). I know in my own heart that (she) is her mother, but at the moment I have to let her be a kid and not take all the role, but some of that role," she said. The woman issued a warning to fellow parents who noticed family or friends acting strangely around children. "Just be wary of them. If they take a special interest in one person, particularly a girl, just be careful. Don't let anybody else go through the hell we've been through," she said. Crown prosecutor David Cordy said Vernon's offending had serious ongoing consequences for the victim, her family and her child. Vernon's defence counsel, Helen Spowart, conceded prison was the only appropriate punishment for his crimes. But Ms Spowart urged the court to set a relatively short non-parole period, saying Vernon had taken significant steps towards rehabilitation. She said her client had voluntarily sought counselling with clinical psychologist Dr Paul Grech, who assessed him as a low risk of re-offending. According to Dr Grech's report, Vernon had a history of personal immaturity, impulsiveness, and lack of social judgement. But he was not predatory or preoccupied with underage sexuality, Ms Spowart said. Ms Spowart asked the court to consider Vernon had no contact with his victim and felt shame and remorse for his behaviour. He had since entered a stable relationship, fathered another child and "grown up a lot", Ms Spowart said. "The relationship has given his life some focus, meaning and stability," she said. Judge Margaret Rizkalla revoked Vernon's bail and adjourned sentencing to a date to be fixed. http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/girl-12-has-babysitters-child/2007/09/20/1189881664247.html

Update- News- "Sex fiend jailed but bailed"- A convicted paedophile walked free on bail yesterday after being jailed for 15 months for ogling children at a swimming pool. And the Herald Sun can reveal that just over a month after being caught at the pool, predator Kevin Patrick Arundell, 61, lured a single mother of a 10-year-old boy to live with him. Arundell, of Boronia, was jailed for a minimum of nine months yesterday, but was bailed after he immediately lodged an appeal, to be heard in October. He must report to police twice a week and is not permitted to enter public pools. The prosecution had argued the public, particularly children, needed protection Herald Sun- 23-7-2011. Sign the open justice petition now. Arundell, who has served nine years in jail for a child sex offence, denied a charge of being a sex offender loitering in a place frequented by children. Ringwood Magistrates' Court heard evidence from two off-duty police officers that on January 11 last year they saw Arundell duck-diving so as to spy on children as young as seven. "I was boiling inside," Sen-Det Daniel Passingham said. "I told him he was a perverted man and (to) get out of the pool." George Georgiou, for Mr Arundell, argued he had been porpoise-diving, not observing children. But magistrate Bill O'Day found Mr Arundell had been deliberately submerging to observe children. This week, a single mother from Tasmania told the Herald Sun how in February 2010 she answered an ad seeking a tenant who was a single mum. One day, she found two detectives at her home. "They asked me what I was doing there and I said 'We live here'. They were horrified. Within half an hour I received a call from child protective services basically telling me we had to get out, it was too unsafe." She said Arundell offered to look after her son when she worked nights. Both of them felt traumatised. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/predator-ogled-kids-at-pool-court-told/story-e6frf7jo-1226100074678|/images/kevin_arundell_2.jpg

After killing the boy, Avent threatened the victim's mother with a knife, sexually assaulted and tried to strangle her. Convicted killer Nathan Avent released (5-2-2013) A convicted child killer has been quietly released back into the community. Nathan Avent, who murdered a 10-year-old boy with a tomahawk in 1994, was released from a Victorian prison on June 4 last year after serving his minimum sentence of 18 years. Avent's sentencing was televised in an Australian-first when Justice Bernard Teague allowed cameras into his courtroom. Avent, then 23, killed the boy, known only as "Steven", and sexually assaulted and tried to strangle the victim's mother on July 11, 1994. The boy was playing quietly with a game on the floor of the Salvation Army-run home in Melton where he lived with his mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, when Avent struck him from behind with the axe. Avent, then of Hoppers Crossing, had tricked his way into the house to commit his crimes. He had done some landscaping at the house and Steven's mother had no reason to fear him when he arrived saying he wanted to look at the backyard. After he murdered the boy, the court heard Avent washed the blood off the axe and his hands and threatened the mother with a knife and sexually assaulted her. The mother had been in the shower at the time Avent butchered her son. The son of Salvation Army officers, Avent was unemployed and his then 19-year-old wife was pregnant when he committed his brutal crimes. Adult Parole Board general manager David Provan told Leader Newspapers that Avent was subject to a strict supervision regime and was closely monitored by Corrections Victoria. "After a thorough assessment, the board ordered that Mr Avent be released from custody on parole from June 4, 2012," he said. Under Avent's parole conditions he must tell a community corrections officer of any change in address or employment within 48 hours of the change and not leave the state without written permission of a Corrections Victoria manager. Avent's residential address would not be made public but victims of crime could register to be kept informed about parole matters concerning an offender, Mr Provan said. Avent was first sentenced to life with a minimum of 21 years by Justice Teague but then appeared before the Court of Appeal and his sentence was varied on December 22, 1995 to 25 years with a non-parole period of 18 years. The period of 529 days pre-sentence detention Avent had already served was part of the revised sentence. Avent claimed he was given a harsher sentence because of media attention on his crime and the presence of a TV camera in the court. Avent told detectives that on the morning of the murder, he "started thinking that today I would try to kill somebody". In the days before the crime, Avent had watched violent films. He had gone to the house armed with a killing kit including the tomahawk, rope, masking tape and knives. The court heard that Avent told detectives he thought that "stuff in movies" might have fuelled his murderous fantasies. It is not known if Avent has contact with the child his then-wife was expecting, who would now be a teen. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/west/convicted-killer-released/story-fngnvmj7-1226570138410 http://www.krock.com.au/index.php/news/23606-parole-board-silent-on-freed-child-killer http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/justice-seen-to-be-done/story-e6frfifx-1111114288464|/images/nathan_john_avent_2.jpg

Victims were 7 children aged between 3 and 13 yrs. Man, 72, jailed for 11 years over abhorrent' sexual assault of seven children- (16-8-2012) A SEX grub who launched a reign of terror on his young victims spanning two decades may die in jail, a court has been told. Cecil Barter, 72, was sentenced to at least 11 years behind bars today for the abhorrent sexual assault of seven children aged between three and 13. The County Court heard Barter had badly exploited (the) dependence and trust of his young victims during the 15-year period of offending. Judge Michael Bourke said Barter had a breathtaking disregard for his victims during the assaults that occurred between 1973 and 1988. Barter pleaded guilty to all but one of 19 charges he faced but was found guilty by a jury at trial last month. Judge Bourke described the rape of one victim as a classically brutal and shameless event. He said Barter had expressed little, really no remorse over the offending. The court heard some of the victims visited him at his Wangaratta home regularly. Each child shared the desperate situation of sex abuse without any real way to stop it, Judge Bourke said. He said the offending featured the manipulation of childlike feelings and very harsh physical violence. The court heard Barters health had deteriorated significantly since his arrest in 2010 and that it was possible he would not be released from prison in his lifetime. But Judge Bourke said while Barter had no prior or subsequent criminal history he was forced to impose a significant penalty because of the abhorrent nature of offences. Barter was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years. He was also placed on the serious sex offender register for life. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/true-crime-scene/man-72-jailed-for-11-years-over-abhorrent-sexual-assault-of-seven-children/story-fnat7dhc-1226451687079

Sex predator walks free (2-5-2007) A DEPRESSED and lonely woman who had sex with a 15-year-old boy in a "foolish lapse" has been given a 12-month suspended sentence. Diana Nicole Bennett, 30, was flattered that a boy of 15 found her sexually attractive. The County Court heard that the boy rang her one morning in 2005 while she was drunk. The pair met and they had sex. The court heard that the boy had previously called Bennett, but she had declined to accept his invitations to meet with him. Today Judge Lance Pilgrim said Bennett was remorseful. Bennett, of Melton, told police she had a significant alcohol problem and would buy three bottles of vodka a week, drinking them straight and on her own. She had drunk a bottle of vodka the night before she had sex with the boy. The court heard that the boy did not make a victim impact statement, but he is now rude to her. Judge Pilgrim said he was satisfied Bennett's offending was a foolish lapse and since the offence had taken steps to rehabilitate herself. Forensic psychologist Ian Joblin gave evidence to the court that Bennett's offending did not represent a psycho-sexual disorder but symptoms of a personality disorder. She requires mental health attention, the court heard. Judge Pilgrim place Bennett on the sex offender register. She will have to report to authorities for 15 years. Her jail term is suspended for 18 months. Bennett pleaded guilty to one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/sex-predator-walks-free/story-e6frf7kx-1111113454629

Ronald Bentley, 44, of Moran St, Norlane, pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates' Court on Monday to knowingly possessing child pornography. Police prosecutor Leading Senior Constable Alana Jackson said police searched Bentley's home on August 30 last year, seizing computers, external hard drives and a number of USB thumb drives. "Forensic analysis revealed a Western digital hard-drive contained 944 images, 387 of which were naked children," she said. "A further 376 images were of comics/drawings of children engaged in sexual activity. Sen-Constable Jackson said 73 images involved sexual violence. "A total of 168 movie files were located," she said. Sen-Constable Jackson said two USB thumb drives contained a total of 35 images and 13 movie files of child pornography. Adrian Paull, for Bentley, said his client received an email in 2008 with some child pornography attached. "He became fixated, trapped in a cycle of downloading child pornography," Mr Paull said. The lawyer said his client was bullied at school, had difficulty showing his feelings and had since sought psychological assistance. Mr Paull said Bentley, who runs a professional website known as The Beauty Academy, was also in the process of trying to start up a bakery in Geelong. "Since his arrest, he has also been financially supporting Open Arms Cambodia, a charity formed to assist children who have been sexually abused," he said. Mr Paull submitted Bentley's offending was at the lower end of the scale but Sen-Constable Jackson disagreed. The prosecutor submitted the offending was at the higher end of the scale and called for an immediate jail sentence. Magistrate Stephen Myall convicted Bentley and sentenced him to four months' jail, suspended for two years.

STEPHEN VAN BEVEREN (VIC- Geelong)|29 yrs old (2011)|To be updated.|Found guilty of indecent assault and stalking in the Geelong Magistrates Court,8-3-2011. News (9-3-2011)- "Rape threat terror plea"- A YOUNG woman has told of a terrifying experience during which she was indecently assaulted and repeatedly threatened with rape while walking to work last month. "I was really scared, the man was acting erratically and I thought if I just kept walking and didn't say anything, he would go away," she told a Geelong court yesterday. "I was just walking to work and I thought I was going to be raped." Stephen Van Beveren, 29, of no fixed address, pleaded not guilty in Geelong Magistrates' Court yesterday to charges of indecent assault and stalking. The victim said she was walking along Boundary Rd, Newcomb, about 8.15am on February 8, this year when she heard a man yelling and screaming on the other side of the road. "When he saw me looking at him, he crossed the road and began following me," she said. "He told me I should walk faster because he was going to rape me." The woman said Van Beveren continued to follow closely behind, at one point telling her to "run as fast as you can because I am going to rape you". She said she pulled away when she felt him pull on her jacket and Van Beveren repeated his threat of rape. During his record of interview, Van Beveren admitted walking up Boundary Rd but denied going near the woman or indecently assault her. He claimed the words he was yelling were part of a rap song he had made up. Magistrate Ann McGarvie said she accepted the victim's evidence and found both charges proved. She remanded Van Beveren in custody for plea and sentencing on April 7. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2011/03/09/247561_news.html http://www.starnewsgroup.com.au/indy/geelong/213/story/128344.html

News (1-3-2008)- "Victims forced to wait for compensation from Eltham sex offender"- A child sex abuse victim who waited 30 years for justice must now wait for compensation. The County Court has ordered former Eltham doctor and convicted pedophile David Alan Bowen to pay $210,000 in compensation to his two victims. Among the highest awards for compensation under the Sentencing Act in Victorian history, it came a day after the Court of Appeal cut the 64-year-olds sentence by four months. But the victims will now have to apply to the Department of Justice to request that property seized after Bowen was sentenced last year be used for the pay-out. Property and shares worth more than $1 million were seized last March. In court on Friday, February 29, Bowen was accused of hiding assets to avoid paying compensation. Bowen had told the court he was barely solvent and could only hand over $20,000. But Judge James Duggan said he did not believe Bowen, a well-established GP with no family to support. When one looks at the history of recent transactions, it seems to me that the likely explanation for his current position is that he attempted to place his assets beyond reach to the extent that he can, he said. Slater and Gordon lawyer Adam Hill, acting for one of the victims, said his client could not understand why Bowens 21-month sentence was cut by four months the day before such significant compensation was awarded. My client is grappling with the correlation between the two, Mr Hill said. Justice Frank Vincent reduced Bowens sentence yesterday, saying the sentencing judge had erred in treating two of the 18 charges as sex offences. Bowen had pleaded guilty to 11 counts of indecent assault and seven counts of gross indecency against two boys, who were 12 and 14 when the abuse began. Mr Hill said his client was haunted by the abuse, which had impacted on his adult life and relationships. The lengthy legal proceedings were extremely distressing, he said. http://diamond-valley-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/victims-forced-to-wait-for-compensation-from-eltham-sex-offender/

News (26-6-2009) - A FORMER Ballarat masseur was yesterday jailed for 10-and-a-half years for sexually assaulting his clients. Peter Charles Brennan, 63, was found guilty by a jury in March of 16 counts of indecent assault and two counts of rape. During the trial the County Court in Ballarat heard Brennan touched 10 women on the breast and vagina during massages at Serenity and Tranquility Health Care and Day Spa between November 2006 and August 2007. One of his victims, a pregnant woman, feared for the safety of her unborn child as a result of Brennan's actions, the court heard. "I felt part of me was stolen that day," she said in a victim impact statement. Brennan also massaged a victim's chest, saying it was helpful for treatment of her asthma. In sentencing, Judge Les Ross said given Brennan's offending over the 10-month period, it was only appropriate he be punished with a significant jail term. He said the victims suffered relationship issues, nightmares and social difficulties. "It is beyond question that in various ways your conduct adversely affected the lives of your victims," he said. Judge Ross ordered Brennan serve seven years before being eligible for parole. Outside court, victims were visibly emotional and relieved to have closure. One woman said she felt the sentence was reasonable and "justice has been served". The woman said she knew of at least four other women who had not reported their experiences, but believed it was important to speak out because "he did the wrong thing". "I wished they (other victims) had come forward, but perhaps they are in denial," she said. Another woman said she felt sorry for everyone Brennan had assaulted. "I was shocked, hearing it read out again, that he used the same tactics (on other victims), the same stories ... that he thought it was alright," she said. "It gives me closure." In a statement, Brennan's former employer Jennifer said she had been impacted in many ways by what happened. "I feel abused and conned and angry at myself that I did not see him for what he was," she said. http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/former-ballarat-masseur-jailed-for-10-years-for-sexual-assaulting-clients/1551503.aspx|/images/peter_brennan_2.jpg

Youth leader found guilty of sexual assault gets 14-month jail term (16-10-2010) A Ballarat church youth group leader has been jailed for 14 months after he was found guilty in the County Court at Ballarat yesterday of sexually assaulting a boy in his care. Darrell Cocking, 75, was found guilty of five counts of indecent assault with a male under 16 and two counts of gross indecency with a male person under 16. The offences occurred between July 1, 1980, and February 28, 1981, while the victim, then 12 years old, was a member of a Ballarat church youth group. Judge Barbara Cotterall sentenced him to 34 months imprisonment, with 20 months to be suspended for three years. Cocking will be registered as a sex offender for the rest of his life. The victim's mother wept with joy as the sentence was read out and said justice had been served. "We put our sons in his trust," she said. "I thought he was a family friend. "It was very difficult for (my son) to come forward, it wasn't easy, he was very brave." In her sentencing, Judge Cotterall said Cocking had breached the trust of the church congregation and the boy's parents. A victim impact statement read to the court revealed the victim, now aged 42, had low self-esteem, and trouble with relationships and holding on to a job. "He lives in constant fear that something of this nature will happen to his two sons," she said. Judge Cotterall said Cocking had destroyed the innocence of a child in the one place his parents thought he would be safe. In her sentencing, she took into account his age and commitment to the community since the offences took place. "You are physically and emotional different to the man who so gravely offended against a ... boy in your care," she said. The victim's mother said the decision had cemented her faith in the justice system. "It's been a long time coming," she said. "We couldn't have hoped for a better result. "It's been very difficult for my son, more difficult than I could understand. Hopefully now he will be able to move on." http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/youth-leader-found-guilty-of-sexual-assault-gets-14month-jail-term/1970601.aspx

Michael Contsas, 34, formerly of Northcote, engaged a 13 and 14 year old girl on a number of occasions in an online chatroom earlier this year, discussing sex in detail and using a web cam, the County Court heard. But the "girls" were in fact police posing as teenagers and Contsas was convicted for what Judge Meryl Sexton described as a "very serious crime''. "This law that you have broken is all about protecting children who can be very vulnerable when contacted online," she said. But Judge Sexton said given Contsas's difficult childhood, borderline intellect, remorse, chance of rehabilitation and absence of any similar offending, the two-year sentence could be wholly suspended for two years and the former concreter should be placed on an $800 good behaviour bond. Judge Sexton said Contsas, who pleaded guilty to using the internet to procure persons under 16 for sexual activity, would also need to take part in a sex offenders program and report to police once a year for the next eight years as a registered sex offender. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/teen-web-creep-wont-be-locked-up/story-e6frf7jo-1226209316843

He also appears to have problems with his local prison dentist after demanding that the State, to provide and fund "full medical and dental treatment required by doctors and specialists of his choosing". This is the same person who was described by his sentencing judge, as engaging in "sheer filth". "Your future rehabilitation depends on coming to grips with the serious nature of your offending," Judge Pilgrim said at the time of sentencing. Crime Victims' Support Association president Noel McNamara said Cooper was in jail by self-invitation. He told the Sun Herald, "He must think he's living in a five-star hotel, making all those demands," Mr McNamara said. Cooper was caught after he pretended to be a teenage boy in the MSN Messenger chat room to discuss sex acts with children. Prosecutors are not saying, whether they will dock the cost of his actions from his prison pay, or whether Cooper will be forced to pay for his legal case. Cooper pleaded guilty in the County Court to nine child sex charges, including knowingly possessing child pornography and using a carriage service to groom a person under 16. He has appealed against the sentence. Cooper says he wants Corrections Victoria or the State Government to fund his treatment. http://www.smarthouse.com.au/Gaming/Console/N3E4U6E7?print=1  News (1-3-2011) - "Court jails child porn man" - A central Victorian man has been jailed for seven years on child pornography charges.

"Man, 55, jailed for sex with chatroom girl" (2-8-2012) A middle-aged Victorian man who had sex with a vulnerable 15-year-old girl he met on a chat site has been jailed for more than five years. Michael Elliott, formerly of Geelong, twice drove to NSW to meet the girl and on the second visit in January 2010 brought her home with him. Elliott, 55, had sex with the girl on a number of occasions while she stayed with him for several weeks in a house he shared with his parents, the Victorian County Court heard on Monday. Elliott claimed the girl was 19, the court heard. Police contacted Elliott on the telephone several times and he denied the girl was with him. He told the girl he would harm himself, or her, if she left. Judge Sue Pullen said there were a number of concerning aspects to the case, including that Elliott was not deterred by police involvement. "Children are vulnerable and especially vulnerable to abuse of trust," she said. Judge Pullen said Elliott, who has admitted knowing the age of consent is 16 years, actively took the girl away from her family. She noted Elliott's offending had been described to the court as having "all the hallmarks of a Lolita obsession". Elliott gave the girl cigarettes and alcohol while she was with him, the court heard. He had met her on a telephone-based games website. Elliott was challenged by the girl's father on one of the visits he made to the girl's hometown, the court heard. On the second visit he met her late at night and drove her hundreds of kilometres back to Victoria. Judge Pullen said psychological reports indicated Elliott had a mild intellectual disability, was naive and had limited social skills. Before going into custody he had only lived away from home once, she said. Elliott, who pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and one count of an indecent act with a child under 16, was jailed for five years and two months. He must serve three years in prison before being eligible for parole and will be a registered sex offender for life. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/man-55-jailed-for-sex-with-chatroom-girl/story-e6frf7kf-1226421624624

In sentencing him, Judge Michael Tinney said Ennis was remorseless for his abhorrent crimes and posed a "moderately high" risk of reoffending. "I have no doubt at all you knew ... that you were involved in very serious criminal activity and nonetheless your offending continued," he said. Judge Tinney said Ennis's lack of empathy for his victims was troubling and he did not have good rehabilitation prospects.

LEONARD CHARLES FATCHEN (Leonard Fatchen) (VIC)|60 yrs old (2013)|To be updated..Pleaded guilty in the County Court in April, 2013.|Leonard Charles Fatchen/ Paedophile/ Repeat Offender - Pleaded guilty in the County Court in April 2013, to four counts of indecent assault.. Victims were 3 teenage boys. Offences occurred between July 1983 and April 1985..Fatchen was jailed in the late 1980s for separate sexual offences. "Sex offender replaced stolen bike to groom victim, court told" (11-4-2013) A sex offender who befriended a teenage boy and his family by replacing the boy's stolen bicycle went on to groom the boy and sexually assault him, a court heard today. Leonard Charles Fatchen, a former council worker, pleaded guilty in the County Court to four counts of indecent assault committed on three separate teenage boys between July 1983 and April 1985. Prosecutor Patrick OHalloran told Judge Gabriele Cannon that on a date in 1983 a local newspaper published the story about the 13-year-old victims bike being stolen. (Fatchen), who was not previously known to the victim or his family, attended the victims home address and provided him with a replacement bike and accessories worth over $400, Mr OHalloran told the court. From this point (Fatchen) engaged more with the victims family. He visited the family home often and was viewed by the victim as part of the family. (Fatchen) took the victim on day trips, paid for all the activities whilst away and bought the victim many gifts. Fatchen, then aged 30, took the boy on a trip to Traralgon to collect two bikes for the victims two younger sisters. While staying in a motel with the boy overnight, a naked Fatchen indecently assaulted the teen. He sexually assaulted the boy on other occasions, including one time while taking the teenager prisoner as part of a war game, the court was told. Fatchen also indecently assaulted two of the teenage boys friends on separate occasions in bedrooms, Mr OHalloran said. The first victim made a complaint to police in 2011, and the other two went to police last year. Fatchen was jailed in the late 1980s for separate sexual offences committed on young people, the court heard. In relation to the current charges, Mr OHalloran said Fatchen, now aged 60, had breached a position of trust with the first victim and his family and involved himself in grooming behaviour. Mr OHalloran submitted that a jail term of two to three years with a 12 to 18-month minimum was appropriate. Defence counsel Olivia Trumble conceded the breach of trust. She said her client had completed sex offender programs while in jail last time and while on parole. Ms Trumble said Fatchen had not committed any sex crimes since he was last released from jail. Citing mitigating factors including Fatchens guilty plea and remorse, she urged the judge to impose a suspended sentence. Judge Cannon will sentence Fatchen on April 19. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/sex-offender-replaced-stolen-bike-to-groom-victim-court-told/story-fnat79vb-1226618351339

Corby witness loses sentence appeal- (10-10-2007) A Victorian prisoner who gave evidence at convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby's trial in Bali has lost an appeal against his own sentence. John Patrick Ford was sentenced in May 2006 to eight years' jail after a Victorian County Court jury found him guilty of 11 charges, including rape and stalking. The 43-year-old, an inmate of Ararat Prison, west of Melbourne, appealed the sentence in the Victorian Court of Appeal. At Ford's trial, the court heard that he subjected a former girlfriend to repeated assaults and threats between March 2003 and February 2004. He raped and stalked her and threatened to kill her after she tried to sever contact with him. In the appeal, Ford's lawyers argued that trial judge Margaret Rizkalla had erred in directing the jury on a count of aggravated burglary, relating to an incident on Valentine's Day 2004 in which Ford had broken into his victim's house and waited for her armed with a knife. They also argued that the jury was inconsistent in verdicts they handed down on the various charges and had not taken into account emails between Ford and his former girlfriend. Justices Frank Vincent, David Ashley and Robert Redlich dismissed the appeal. "The respective positions were clearly put before the jury and in the context of appropriate instructions concerning the burden and standard of proof," Justice Vincent said. "Her Honour's reference to the applicant's (Ford's) admission that he brought the knife into the house, albeit, he claimed, from the shed, was made against that background," he said. "None of the grounds of the application having been made out, I would dismiss this application." Ford told an Indonesian court in 2005 that Corby was an unwitting "victim of domestic drug trafficking run by petty criminals and cowards". http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=262230 Corby witness jailed over rape- (26-5-2006) The Victorian prisoner who testified at the original Bali trial of Schapelle Corby has been jailed for at least five years for rape and stalking. A County Court jury last December found John Patrick Ford guilty of a string of charges including raping a woman he knew. The court heard the offences occurred between March 2003 and February 2004 and involved one victim. The jury heard that on one occasion Ford, now 42, placed a knife to the victim's throat and threatened to "bleed (her) like a pig". He also broke into the victim's house armed with a knife and put a blood-soaked teddy bear on her bed. In January 2004, Ford rang the victim and threatened to kill himself if she did not come to his home. When the woman arrived he raped her, the jury was told. Ford was found guilty of 11 charges, including one count of rape, three counts of intentionally causing injury and two counts of threatening to inflict serious injury. Ford, who has already spent more than 800 days in remand, was found guilty of one count of false imprisonment and one of threat to kill and of stalking. He was also found guilty of one count each of aggravated burglary and burglary. Judge Rizkalla said she satisfied Ford was capable of rehabilitation as long he didn't make contact with the victim again. He stood emotionless as Judge Rizkalla sentenced him to eight years' jail with a minimum jail term of five years' jail. Trial delayed- The court heard Ford's trial was delayed due to the media coverage Corby's case had attracted. Judge Rizkalla said as a result of giving evidence in Corby's trial Ford would also suffer an onerous prison term. Ford told a Bali court that the marijuana found in Corby's bodyboard bag was placed there without her knowledge by criminals involved in a drug-trafficking ring operating at Australian airports. At an earlier hearing Ford's lawyer, Tom Danos, said he believed two violent attacks on Ford were a result of testifying in Bali. Mr Danos read a letter from Corby to Ford dated March 29, 2003: "Dear Mr John Ford," it said. "Firstly thank you. No words can express my gratitude, relief and thankfulness of the way I feel towards you. You have and are putting your own safety and welfare in danger. Coming forward to tell what you know, to do all you possibly can do to help me out of this living hell I have unwillingly found myself in." "Pray today the judges will hear everything you have to say and pray today, the outcome of this trial - your testimony - will set me free, to come home, where I belong. Today you may save my life. My deepest respect, thank you, Schapelle". http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/corby-witness-jailed-over-rape/2006/05/26/1148524868143.html|/images/john_ford_2.jpg

News (28-3-2012)- "Federal Court approves sex fiend's visa"- A GILLARD government bid to cancel the visa of an African paedophile who impregnated a 12-year-old has been rejected by the Federal Court. Immigration Minister Chris Bowen tried to have Thomas Scott Gbojueh's humanitarian visa cancelled on character grounds. But Gbojueh appealed to the Federal Court and Mr Bowen's decision was overturned on Friday. The Government said it was disappointed by the ruling and was seeking legal advice on its options for appeal. In 2009, Gbojueh was convicted and jailed after pleading guilty to twice having sex with his lover's daughter. The girl was 12 at the time of the offences. The Immigration Department tried to cancel the Liberian refugee's visa, but the Administrative Appeals Tribunal last year rejected the department's decision. The tribunal said Gbojueh feared persecution in Liberia and, while he had been convicted of a serious crime, he was deemed a low risk of reoffending. After that decision, Mr Bowen stepped in to set it aside in a bid to cancel Gbojueh's visa. That was rejected by the Federal Court on Friday. A spokesman for Mr Bowen said the Government was now considering its options to appeal. "The decision is disappointing and we are urgently looking at legal options," he said. Opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison urged Mr Bowen to use his powers to take further action. Mr Morrison said the Coalition would support the minister in taking "any action under these powers" to ensure a convicted paedophile was not released in Australia. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/true-crime-scene/court-approves-sex-fiends-visa/story-fnat7dhc-1226311904009 News (4-5-2011)- "African pedophile wins reprieve on persecution fears"- THE Gillard government's attempts to deport a pedophile African refugee who impregnated a 12-year-old girl in Australia have suffered a setback, after the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled he could not be returned to Liberia because he fears persecution. Immigration Minister Chris Bowen was last night seeking legal advice after the tribunal overruled his department's decision to cancel the visa of Liberian refugee Thomas Scott Gbojueh despite admitting he "plainly" failed the government's character test. In 2009, Gbojueh, 43, was sentenced to 27 months' jail after pleading guilty to twice having sex with his lover's daughter, with the first offence taking place less than four months after he arrived in Australia from West Africa.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/african-pedophile-wins-reprieve-on-persecution-fears/story-fn59niix-1226049421427

Victim was a 12 yr old girl. News (6-5-2011)- Bendigo Advertiser- Jarrod Nadort pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16. His friend, Dale Goss, 25, of Golden Square, pleaded guilty to one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16. At the pre-sentence hearing for all matters, prosecutor Patrick Southey called for a sentence of seven to 10 years with a non-parole period of five to seven years for Nadort, and two to three years jail with a non-parole period of 12 to 18 months for Goss. Judge Rachelle Lewitan said Nadorts offending was very serious, considering the violent nature of the rape and the fact that the victim was affected by alcohol.

Goss was sentenced to two years jail with a non-parole period of 16 months. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/rapist-gets-10-years/2154635.aspx News (3-6-2010)- "Girl, 12, rape charges"- TWO Bendigo men have been charged with the rape of a 12-year-old girl. The men, both in their 20s, are alleged to have consumed drugs and alcohol and had sex with the girl in full view of their friends despite her pleading with them to stop. Long Gully man Dale Goss, 25, and Jarrod Nadort, 23, of Lockwood were arrested on Tuesday after the girl made a report to police. They appeared in the Bendigo Magistrates Court yesterday afternoon for a bail application. It was opposed by police on the grounds that the charges were of such a serious nature that the men were considered a flight risk. Prosecutor, Leading Senior Constable Dave Somerton said police also believed the men would interfere with prosecution witnesses and endanger the safety of the victim if allowed back into the community. Despite their concerns Magistrate Jennifer Tregent granted bail. Detective Senior Constable David Newman from the sexual crimes squad said Goss and Nadort picked up a group of people, including the girl, from KFC in Bendigo on Saturday night. He said the group then drove to Nadort's bungalow at his parents' house where they consumed alcohol and the two men smoked cannabis. While in the Bungalow, the court was told, Nadort began touching the girl and had sex with her on a bed. "She was telling him to stop, she was trying to push him away," Detective Senior Constable Newman said. Nadort is alleged to have had sex with the girl a second time that night. He is alleged to have followed the girl out to a rear shed, pushed her onto a mattress and tried to remove her clothes. When she struggled he allegedly slapped her across the face and then had sex with her. Goss is alleged to have had sex with the girl on a couch inside the bungalow. Detective Senior Constable Newman said the girl awoke to find Goss standing over her naked. He then removed her clothes and lifted her on top of him while he sat on the couch and they had sex, the court heard. Two other people who were present at the time have made statements to police alleging they witnessed Nadort and Goss have sex with the girl. Both men deny the allegations. Nadort is charged with two counts of rape, two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16, one count of common law assault and one count of indecent assault. Goss is charged with one count of rape, one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and one count of common law assault.

SHAUN GUNSTON (VIC)|23 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 3.5 yrs jail - 2 yrs and 1 month non parole. Registered as a sex offender for the rest of his life|Used the internet to groom a 12-year-old girl for sex. Banned from working in schools News (27-2-2012)- "Internet predator jailed for grooming 12-year-old girl for sex"- A MAN who used the internet to groom a 12-year-old girl for sex has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years' jail with a minimum of two years and one month. Shaun Gunston, 23, had been stood down from his job as an education computer network employee - a position he took after his offending - pending the outcome of his case, the County Court heard. He will now be permanently banned from working in schools. Gunston was 18 when he began to communicate with the grade 6 girl in an online chatroom and - after grooming her for a year - continued a sexual relationship with her until she was 15, Judge Susan Cohen said. The girl has since been emotionally scarred by the relationship and has attempted suicide, but Judge Cohen said it was unclear to what extent other factors in the girl's life had played a part. Gunston's crimes - grooming and penetration offences - were not linked to his employment as a computer technician but happened over a period from August 2006 until December 2008, the court was told. Judge Cohen, who described Gunston as an immature and lonely man who had been bullied at school, said he was "considerably older" than his victim and had the "power to manipulate" the young girl. The court heard Gunston threatened to withdraw his friendship from the girl unless she transmitted graphic images of herself. Once, at a swimming pool complex, he had used a "degree of force" to insist on a sexual encounter with the girl. Judge Cohen said Gunston would be required to be registered as a sex offender for the rest of his life. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/internet-predator-jailed-for-grooming-12-year-old-girl-for-sex/story-fn7x8me2-1226282794499

News (18-2-2012)- "Pervert spied on women"- A HIGHTON peeping tom has admitted to years of spying on his female neighbours for sexual thrills because it was better than porn. Geelong Magistrates' Court heard Bruce Guy, 51, was caught out in October last year after concerned neighbours installed a night vision digital security camera. He was identified on the tape wearing underpants and work boots. Police prosecutor Leading Senior Constable Geoff Lamb said neighbours around Guy's Greyfern Court home had sighted a prowler for the past eight years. He said police were called on May 23, 2008, after a neighbour noticed a man peering through the windows of a neighbouring property and masturbating. On April 26, 2009, police again attended after two neighbours noticed the man. He fled as they approached. Sen-Constable Lamb said a 50cm gap in Guy's fence had given him access to four neighbouring properties. "On November 9, 2011, a warrant was issued and the accused arrested. He made full and frank admission," he said. Sen-Constable Lamb said Guy also admitted to other incidents that the neighbours were unaware of. "The reason given was 'to satisfy a lack of stimulation and contact with people' and it was 'more realistic to look at real people than pornography'," he said. Guy's defence lawyer told the court his client had a number of "social issues" and was embarrassed by his actions. Magistrate Stephen Myall sentenced Guy to an 18-month community corrections order, which includes sex offender treatment and mental health programs. Mr Myall said he noted the concern of the residents and warned Guy if he returned to court again he would be dealt with more harshly. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2012/02/18/308371_news.html

But a police prosecutor told Geelong Magistrates' Court, Walter Hueber would have had his obligations fully explained to him when first placed on it. "Those conditions included having to report any change in personal circumstances, including a change of address, change of motor vehicle and/or phone number, to police within 14 days," Leading Senior Constable David Vanderpol said. Hueber, 59, formerly of Dereel and now living in Geelong, pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates' Court yesterday to four failures to comply with the Sex Offenders Register.

NEVILLE THOMAS HUNTER (Neville Hunter) (VIC- Wendouree)|65 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 23-5-2005, in the County Court at Ballarat, to 6 yrs jail - 4.5 yrs non parole|Neville Thomas Hunter - Former primary school teacher- Pleaded guilty to 4 counts of indecent assault, one count of buggery and one count of possessing child pornography.. He worked at various primary schools during his career, including Millbrook, Invermay, Dean and Alfredton. "Teacher jailed for sex crimes" (24-5-2005) A former primary school teacher who used his profession to seduce and molest a 14-year-old boy was jailed for at least 4 1/2 years yesterday. Neville Thomas Hunter did not flinch as he was convicted and sentenced to six years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 4 1/2 years, in the County Court at Ballarat. As he was escorted from the court dock, the 58-year-old did not look to his supporters, which included his sister and a former colleague, but walked slowly behind the court orderly, his head bowed. In sentencing Hunter, who pleaded guilty to four counts of indecent assault, one count of buggery and one count of possessing child pornography, Judge Julie Nicholson said his offending was "predatory", "pre-meditated" and "opportunistic". She described the facts of the case as "most serious, disturbing, sickening and at times horrifying" and said Hunter had robbed the victim of his innocence through an "obvious process of seduction". "He (the victim) has been crushed for life, Mr Hunter, and I'm of the view that that arises from your offending," she said. "You and others in the community need to be made aware that predatory, abusive, wanton and opportunistic abuse of young, immature children will warrant (fitting) punishment by the courts." Outside the court, the victim's wife described Hunter's sentence as "appropriate". She said while the case was sad for all involved, an immediate jail term was necessary. "It was very important to get the message across that you can't do that sort of thing," she said. "It does affect the person literally in every aspect of life, relationship wise and everything . . . and that's going to continue right through his life." The victim did not attend court yesterday. Earlier, the court had heard Hunter first approached the victim in Victoria Park in 1979, telling him he was a school teacher who understood children and their problems. He then lured the 14-year-old boy back to his house in Yew St, Wendouree, where he sexually assaulted him in his bedroom. The court heard the pair later engaged in a sporadic relationship for 15 years, despite the victim marrying and having children. The victim reported Hunter to the police after having an argument with him in May 2001 - the same year Hunter retired. Defence lawyer Graham Keil had told the court Hunter had a 37-year, unblemished teaching record at various primary schools, including Millbrook, Invermay, Dean and Alfredton, and did not have any prior convictions. http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/585191/teacher-jailed-for-sex-crimes/ http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/584579/teacher-admits-sex-crimes/

It was discovered he had an outstanding warrant in the Northern Territory and the officer reached in to turn off the vehicles ignition. But Incani drove off with the officer suffering minor injuries. Police later arrested Incani on the Selwyn Creek Track in the Buckland Valley about 40 kilometres south of Porepunkah at 5.30pm. Incani pleaded guilty to charges of escaping from police custody, resisting arrest and recklessly causing injury. The case was heard by magistrate John Murphy through a video link to Shepparton. Incani was bailed to reappear for sentencing.  http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/57935/police-drag-racer-guilty/   No more jail for sex act teacher- (31-10-2008)  A TEACHER who indecently dealt with a Northern Territory student will not serve any more time behind bars after winning an appeal for a fully-suspended sentence.  http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/10/31/13015_ntnews.html   Sex attack teacher gets 3 months jail,but walks free on bail-(12-7-2008)  A FAMILY friend of a teenage student indecently assaulted by her teacher called out "not enough" as the man was jailed for three months yesterday. And 40 minutes later the 40-year-old teacher was bailed by Darwin's Chief Magistrate after he lodged an appeal against the sentence to be heard in the Supreme Court. Melbourne-based teacher Paul Incani, who pleaded guilty to indecently dealing with the teenage Darwin student, proceeded to "dry hump" the girl at a popular picnic spot, indecently touch her and make her lie semi-naked on his back. Magistrate Greg Cavanaghwho adjourned the matter overnight to consider the teacher's fatesaid he was "satisfied" he had breached his special relationship with his student, given the teacher had disguised the girl in sunglasses and a hat for a secret liaison at Lake Alexander last year and sent her intimate text messages. "This was a planned and sustained seduction by a mature adult of a young lady," Mr Cavanagh said. "It was not something that was on the spur of the moment ... (and) not something that was incidental to an innocent arrangement. "To suggest otherwise is fanciful." He said the man's crimes were serious as they were not "just a passing caress". And the teacher's "great affection" for his student had destroyed his teaching career, with his name to be placed on the national sex offenders register. "I've got no doubt that (he) knew he was doing the wrong thing but couldn't resist the temptation," he said. He said the teacher's actions had an "ongoing impact" on the girl, who yesterday publicly spoke of her despair and spiral into self-harm. Mr Cavanagh said the teacher's behaviour should be "denounced" as "outrageous". "He was entrusted with the tutoring by the young lady's parents at home. He's betrayed their trust and the community's trust," he said. He sentenced the teacher to 15 months jail, suspended after three months. The maximum penalty is eight years jail. As Incani was led out of court, a family friend said "have a nice time". But his lawyer Peter Elliott lodged an immediate appeal, and chief magistrate Jenny Blokland granted him bail on strict conditions to return to Melbourne with his father. Incani showed no emotion nor made any comment as he left court. He is expected to appear in the Supreme Court later this year. http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/07/12/4651_ntnews.html Sex act teacher ruined my life http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/07/11/4637_ntnews.html|/images/paul_incani_2.jpg

News (5-11-2009)- "No jail for two men over child porn images" Two Geelong men charged separately over possessing child pornography will serve their sentences in the community rather than behind bars. Walter Kerr, 57, of Church St, Manifold Heights, had pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates Court to possessing 28 images of child pornography. The images he possessed were said by Magistrate Ron Saines to include the rape of pubescent and pre-pubescent females. Kerr told an earlier hearing he downloaded the child pornography for excitement. In a separate hearing Mark Anderson, 37, of Beacon Point Rd, Clifton Springs, pleaded guilty to a single count of possessing 60 images of child pornography. The court heard Anderson paid for the child pornography over the internet before local police were alerted to his activities by Federal Police. Mr Saines said the images collected by Anderson were of very young pre-pubescent females engaged in sexual acts with adult males . The clear distress of some of the victims is indicative of a serious case of child pornography, he said. Police prosecutor Leading Senior Constable Geoff Lamb called for jail sentences in both cases, while lawyers for Kerr and Anderson argued against it. Both men were convicted and sentenced to six months jail to be served in the form of intensive corrections orders. Kerr was also placed on a 12 month Good Behavior Bond and ordered to take part in the sex offenders program. Both men will remain on the Sex Offenders Register for eight years.

Zynal Khan, 27, admitted punching a sex worker in Melbourne on November 1, 2009, four months after the end of his parole for raping a woman in 2003. In the County Court, defence lawyer Julie Sutherland said Khan acknowledged his offending was "cowardly and brutal". Khan was jailed in 2004 for a minimum four years and two months for raping a female passer-by on a footpath at Thornbury in Melbourne's north while cars drove past. He was released in September 2007 on parole, which finished in June 2009.

He has been in custody since the latest offences and will become eligible for parole in about seven months.

Khan grabbed the woman, put his hand over her mouth and told her he had a knife before raping her on the footpath. Judge David Morrow said people driving past in cars saw parts of the incident, but did not intervene. The judge said the attack was not premeditated, but was extremely serious and predatory behaviour. He said Khan's actions constituted a woman's "worst nightmare". The court was told the victim suffered various injuries, including swelling, bruising and aggravation of the spinal nerve. She has also been treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. Judge Morrow commended the victim for her "intelligent and rational" manner during the ordeal. http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/08/1086460294653.html?from=storylhs

Police allege Andrew McKenzie King, of Newtown, kissed and had sex with the teen. He was charged under legislation that stipulates a person must not take part in an act of sexual penetration with a 16 or 17-year-old child to whom he or she is not married and who is under his or her care, supervision or authority. In 2009, the girls mother dropped her off at Mr Kings home ahead of a joint project the next morning. Both the mother and daughter, who cannot be named, believed others would also be sleeping at Mr Kings home that night. But when the mother left, Mr King told the girl the others had emailed to say they could no longer make it. Police allege Mr King, 34, kissed the girl as they sat in the lounge room together before moving to the bedroom where they had sex. Mr Morrisey also highlighted the fact police initially told the mother and daughter Mr King had not committed an offence when they filed the complaint in July of 2009. The girl returned to police with additional information in January this year and police charged Mr King. Court also heard the girl suffered from anxiety and had been seeing psychologists around the time of the alleged offending. Mr King is a tennis coach and owner of a tennis centre. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2010/12/22/233841_news.html|/images/andrew_mckenzie_king_2.jpg
TREVOR WAYNE KING (VIC- Mildura)|50 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 1-6-2012, in the Mildura County Court, to 3.5 yrs jail - 2 yrs and 3 months non parole.|Trevor King - Found guilty 8 counts of performing an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 (Victim was a teenage boy). Repeat Offender. 18 prior convictions, including 8 for indecent assault,and 10 for gross indecency. Victims were 2 boys aged between seven and 10 yrs. News (2-6-2012)- "Man, 50, jailed: Businessman guilty of indecent acts"- A MILDURA businessman who was this week found guilty on eight counts of performing an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 has been jailed for 3 years. County Court Judge Tim Wood said the offending by Trevor Wayne King was a carefully orchestrated plan to entrap the victim in order to gratify the accuseds deviant desires. King, 50, had pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of performing an indecent act with a child under 16 and was acquitted on four counts by direction of the judge. However, the jury found him guilty on the remaining eight counts and Judge Wood ordered him to serve at least two years and three months in jail before being eligible for parole. At his plea hearing in the County Court sitting at Mildura yesterday, Crown prosecutor David ODoherty said King had shown absolutely no remorse, concocted an allegation of motive for the victims accusations and his defence relied on accusing the victim of inventing a deliberate conspiracy or calculated lie. Mr ODoherty said the planned and calculated grooming of the boy would have continued had the boy not brought an end to the offending. The court was told King had 18 prior convictions  including eight for indecent assault and 10 for gross indecency  committed against two brothers aged between seven and 10. Those offences took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s and King subsequently received a suspended term of imprisonment in 1997 after pleading guilty. Mr ODoherty said the more recent offending was a serious example of indecent conduct that had demonstrated a gross breach of trust. Defence counsel Florian Andrighetto said the prosecutions emphasis on Kings prior offending was disturbing because he was a very young man at the time and the matters were not dealt with by the courts until many years later. Mr Andrighetto said that while Kings more recent offending was a serious crime, the reality is that it is at the very low end of the scale. This offending involved no touching, he said. http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/man-50-jailed-businessman-guilty-of-indecent-acts/2577268.aspx

Serving a 7 year jail sentence in the USA for the abuse of a 12-year-old boy in Missouri-2011. Paroled in April 2012 and immediately arrested by US Marshalls. Australian Police are seeking to extradite Kramer from the US-May 2012-below. "Jewish teacher David Kramer jailed for sexually assaulting boys at Yeshiva College" (24-7-2013) A Jewish teacher who committed "unforgivable" crimes on four students at a Melbourne school has been jailed for a maximum of three years and four months. But father of 11 Rabbi David Kramer could walk free from prison after just three months because of time already served in pre-sentence detention. The 53-year-old convicted paedophile is believed to be the first member of Jewish institution in Australia to have admitted, and been sentenced for, child sex crimes. The sentence has been welcomed by victims who said while it was lower than they had hoped, justice had been served. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/jewish-teacher-david-kramer-jailed-for-sexually-assaulting-boys-at-yeshiva-college/story-fni0fee2-1226684282653 Jewish news (25-5-2012)- "Child molester jailed as police seek extradition"- Australia's efforts to extradite child molester David Kramer are gathering momentum, with the former Yeshivah College (Melbourne) teacher set to front the Federal Court in the US in a matter of months. Kramer was reportedly spirited to Israel in 1992 by the college, before moving to the US a decade later, where he was convicted of sexually abusing a 12-year-old boy in Missouri and sentenced to seven years in jail at the Missouri Department of Corrections. He was paroled in April after serving four years of his sentence and arrested immediately by US Marshals on his release because of the extradition request by the Australian government. A spokesperson for the Attorney-Generals Department told The AJN that Kramer was wanted by Victorian authorities to face prosecution for the offences of indecent assault and indecent acts with a child under the age of 16 and that Mr Kramer was arrested in the United States on 23 April 2012 in response to Australias request for his extradition. The alleged assaults were committed against four boys at Yeshivah College between 1989 and 1992. Kramer is currently on remand in a St Louis jail and has applied for bail. He will likely face court in August for the beginning of extradition proceedings. A lawyer for Kramer, Matthew Chase, said his client denies the charges and will argue the veracity of the claims made against the 51-year-old, given more than 20 years have passed since the alleged abuses took place. Theres no option but to fight it [the charges]. He denies the wrongdoing vehemently, Chase told The AJN. Its tough [because] hes now a convicted felon. Its frustrating for me to have a client who is facing charges that could have been brought at any time in the last 20 years and chose not to. Its 20 years-plus old complaints. Complaints which were made at the time and for 20 years Australia very easily could have found out where he was. Its not like hes been a fugitive hiding from justice, nor was he a person who fled Australia. Chase said one of the alleged victims has accused Kramer of hundreds of separate instances of abuse, a claim he describes as outlandish. They have a lot of statements  Theres no physical evidence. They have nothing and its 20 years old. Victim advocate Manny Waks, who has publicly claimed he was sexually assaulted at Yeshivah College, said it is common for accusations of abuse to surface years after the incidents are alleged to have happened. It is important to understand that children who were sexually abused often do not take any remedial action until they are much older, Waks said. It could be due to shame, guilt, confusion and/or pressure  depending on the individual and their circumstances. But regardless of when remedial action is taken, often the impact of the abuse is long-lasting. Perpetrators and their enablers should always be held to full account, irrespective of the length of time after the abuse. It should be left to the judicial process to determine the veracity of such serious allegations. Victoria Police would not comment on the investigation or the extradition proceedings. http://www.jewishnews.net.au/child-molester-jailed-as-police-seek-extradition/26237 News (20-7-2011)- Police wrote to former Yeshivah College students earlier this year, urging them to contact Crime Stoppers if they had been assaulted between 1989 and 1993. The investigation was mainly linked to former teacher David Kramer, who fled Australia in the early 1990s after parents complained he had sexually abused students. Police hope to extradite Kramer when he has served a seven-year prison sentence in the US for sodomising a 12-year-old boy. - - http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/synagogue-asks-alleged-child-molester-to-stand-down-20110719-1hne0.html|/images/david_kramer_2.jpg
DAMIEN JOHN LANCASTER (VIC)|28 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in Feb 2008, in the Melbourne County Court,to 12.5 yrs jail - 9.5 yrs non parole.|Damien Lancaster - Pleaded guilty to 12 charges, including 3 counts of rape, 3 of indecent assault, and one count of kidnapping.. Has prior convictions for indecent assault dating back to 1999 News (7-2-2008)- "Man jailed for 12 years for horriffic sexual assault"- A MAN who broke into a woman's home and subjected her to a horrific and prolonged sexual assault has been sentenced to 12-and-a-half years' jail. Damien John Lancaster, 24, was ordered to serve a minimum term of nine-and-a-half years for the attack on a woman in her North Melbourne home on June 23 last year. Judge Frank Shelton said the attack, in which the victim was threatened with a knife and told she would be raped and her dog stabbed, was "every woman's worst nightmare''. The County Court heard Lancaster, who had been chroming paint, forced the woman, aged in her 20s, to perform oral sex twice, digitally raped her, slapped her and kissed and groped her during the ordeal. The woman suggested they walk to a nearby service station after Lancaster said he wanted to get some cigarettes. At the service station the woman asked a staff member to call the police and Lancaster ran off. "Your offending was quite horrific as you terrified your victim for an hour and three-quarters,'' Judge Shelton said. The court heard Lancaster was already on the sex offenders register at the time, having had five prior convictions for indecent assault dating back to 1999. Lancaster pleaded guilty to 12 charges in relation to last year's attack, including three counts of rape, three of indecent assault and one count of kidnapping. Judge Shelton said the victim felt obliged to move house, still suffered heightened emotions, couldn't bear to be in the dark and her sleep was effected. But he said she was a woman of strong character and was determined to overcome the effect of her horrific experience. Judge Shelton said Lancaster's offending generally resulted from his dependence on inhalants, having commenced chroming when he was 14 years old. Lancaster claimed to have been sexually abused by a family member between the ages of seven and nine and saw himself as a marginalised outsider, in part because of a speech impediment, the judge said. But he said Lancaster had co-operated fully with police and had indicated he would plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. Lancaster will remain on the sex offenders' register and will be required to report for life. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/years-for-nightmarish-sexual-attack/story-e6frf7kx-1111115496253
DEAN ALAN LECORNU (VIC)|32 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in 2011, in the County Court, to 20 months jail - 13 months non parole|Downloaded child pornography onto mobile phones. Also had magazines featuring the nude child photography of artist Bill Henson sent to him at a secure village for sex offenders. Dean Lecornu has a long and disturbing history including the rape of a schoolgirl and trying to attack children in school toilets at knifepoint. News (6-7-2011)- "Paedophile who had Bill Henson art sent to him jailed over child porn"- A PAEDOPHILE who had magazines featuring the nude child photography of artist Bill Henson sent to him at a secure village for sex offenders has been jailed for keeping child pornography. But the controversial Henson images were not illegal - unlike the 19 pictures of naked and abused children Dean Alan Lecornu had stored on mobile phones he smuggled in under the noses of supervisors. Lecornu was yesterday jailed for 20 months for downloading child pornography on the mobile phones and breaching a supervision order imposed to protect the community from him. The court heard that Lecornu used "arguably innocent pictures" for "depraved purposes". He was living under strict security with other sex offenders at Corella Place, known as the "Village of the Damned", when he had copies of magazines including Art Monthly sent to him. Yesterday County Court Judge Sue Pullen refused to allow Lecornu to keep the anonymity he had been afforded in the four years he has been on a supervision order. The decision came just days after the Herald Sun launched its Open Justice campaign, seeking that laws banning the identities of offenders "in the public interest" be scrapped and hearings involving our most dangerous rapists and paedophiles be openly reported. Judge Pullen noted that suppression of Lecornu's name had not stopped him from offending or breaching the supervision order. It was no longer in the public interest to keep his identity secret, the judge said. Lecornu, 32, has a long and disturbing history including the rape of a schoolgirl and trying to attack children in school toilets at knifepoint. The Justice Department asked for Lecornu's name to be published after yesterday's sentence, saying there was little evidence of rehabilitation. The court heard he had ordered the magazines for their "material depicting near naked children ... for the purpose of satisfying (his) masturbatory desires while on the Extended Supervision Order and from within Corella Place". After being caught with the magazines Lecornu had been warned about his behaviour but still brought in the phones and downloaded child pornography. One of the offences happened just a week after his supervision order had been reviewed. Staff tried to search his unit in September last year but he blocked his door and after a brief standoff staff entered and found two mobile phones. When police came to search again in December he struggled with officers as they tried to seize another phone. A spare phone was also found. Lecornu claimed he was bored living at Corella Place, only socialising with other sex offenders. His lawyer had asked for Lecornu's punishment to be "time served" with a further jail sentence suspended. But Judge Pullen said she must consider community protection and jailed him for 20 months, with a minimum of 13 months. Henson's work came under fire after police seized his photographs of a 13-year-old girl from a Sydney gallery in 2008. They later found he had not committed any crime. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/paedophile-who-had-bill-henson-art-sent-to-him-jailed-over-child-porn/story-fn7x8me2-1226088573951

Has pleaded guilty to offences including, committing an indecent act with a child under 16, and 4 counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16. Has 2 prior convictions for indecent assault. Sex offender sentenced (11-3-2011) A WARRNAMBOOL man with an intellectual disability has been placed on a five-year intensive residential treatment order after pleading guilty to sex offences. Timothy Leishman, 30, of Fairy Street, appeared in the Warrnambool County Court on five charges and pleaded guilty during October last year to one charge of committing an indecent act with a child under 16 and four counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16. He was remanded in custody while reports were prepared with respect to his suitability for a treatment order in a facility of incarceration, treatment and rehabilitation for sex offenders with intellectual disabilities. Mr Leishman has two prior convictions for indecent assault among a long history of offending. On February 22 this year he was sentenced after County Court Judge David Parsons received reports. Mr Leishman pleaded guilty to five charges, including sexual penetration of a child aged under 16 years, which came out of incidents in the Camperdown district during February last year. The court heard Leishman moved to Warrnambool in 1995 and went to the special development school before attending TAFE in 1998 where he was involved in damaging a lift which cost thousands of dollars to repair. He has since worked on variety of jobs including fruit picking, milking, motor wrecking and cutting firewood. He also has seven children with five different women. He has been classified as having an intellectual disability and has also been registered as a sex offender for life. Experts assessed him as currently presenting a serious risk of violence to another person. http://www.standard.net.au/news/local/news/general/sex-offender-sentenced/2100165.aspx
AIDEN LESLIE LEWIS (Aidan Lewis) (VIC- Portland)|26 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to be updated.|Aidan Leslie Lewis- Pleaded guilty to using a communications service to groom a person aged under 16 years for sexual activity, using a communications service to have child pornography sent to him and two counts of accessing child pornography. "Sex predator groomed boy, 13, on Facebook and mobile phone" (26-12-2012) A sex predator pressured a 13-year-old boy he met on Facebook into taking and texting a naked photo of himself. Details of the mans attempts to groom the boy for sex emerged during a hearing in Warrnambool County Court yesterday. Aidan Leslie Lewis, 26, of Findlay Street, Portland, pleaded guilty to using a communications service to groom a person aged under 16 years for sexual activity, using a communications service to have child pornography sent to him and two counts of accessing child pornography. He will be sentenced next week. Judge Bill Stuart said the case was a classic example of the type of grooming new legislation aimed to address. The offences were uncovered when the victims mother found a naked photo on her sons phone. In a victim impact statement she said it was horrific to find her son had been the victim of such a predator. The boy said he had been through emotional trauma, felt embarrassed and humiliated and his parents now had a hard time trusting him. Police alleged that on May 25 last year the accused made contact with the teenager using the false account name of Aiden Ryan and began sending private messages through the popular internet social networking site. Those messages were exchanged for three days before the defendant asked for and obtained the victims mobile telephone number. Between May 28 and May 30, 228 text messages and two phone calls were exchanged. Lewis told the victim he wanted to chat on the phone and get to know him better while inquiring about his hobbies, whether he lived with his parents and his sexual preferences and practises. The defendant told the victim he had been hurt by younger guys and when assured by the victim he would not do so, Lewis said that was what the last guy said and that the experience had really hurt him. He told the boy he had been used, lent money to people and now found it hard to trust anyone, although he said the victim seemed different. Lewis told him he knew he was younger but it was hard to find the right people, saying he had mates who dated boys heaps younger. He also told the victim he would like to take him out on a date, see a movie, have dinner and then hug and kiss him, saying he was a babe, spunk, a hottie, he had a cute smile and sounded hot on the phone. The court heard that via the text messages Lewis repeatedly asked for explicit photos of the victim but when the boy became cautious Lewis turned the situation to his advantage and made it a trust issue. When the victim replied he may not have enough credit on his phone, Lewis transferred $5 to it. The following day he again repeatedly asked for a hot pic with pants off. The victim took a photo of his genitals on his mobile phone and sent it to Lewis. On August 11 police executed a search warrant at Lewis home and seized a mobile phone and three computers. A forensic examination of the computers revealed 51 images and nine videos with the images ranking up to the most sexually explicit category. Most of the material was of child exploitation. In an interview with police Lewis admitted there was probably child pornography on his computers and that he used a false Facebook account, but he couldnt recall conversations with the victim or asking him to send photos. Lewis answered no comment when it was put to him that his communications with the victim were as if he was developing a relationship, and when details of text messages suggesting they meet were read to him. He told police he thought the victim was 16 years old and he didnt know it was illegal to get someone to send an explicit photo. http://www.cvsa.com.au/?p=1359
DAVID ALLAN LIEBELT (VIC- Portland)|52 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 12-1-2011, in the Geelong Magistrates Court, to 8 months jail - suspended for 2 yrs.|David Allan Liebelt- committed an indecent act with a child under 16 years. Portland sex offender in custody after refusing to obey register conditions..22-8-2011 A PORTLAND sex offender who refuses to obey the conditions of being on the sex offenders' register has been remanded in custody for another fortnight to work out his legal options. David Allan Liebelt, 51, of Arthur Street, appeared in the Warrnambool Magistrates Court last week to apply for bail. He has been charged with three counts of failing to abide by conditions of the sex offenders' register. After hearing a bail application, Magistrate Jonathan Klestadt decided to further remand Mr Liebelt in custody until August 30. Mr Liebelt has already spent a month in custody after being arrested in Portland. The court heard that on January 12 this year in the Geelong Magistrates Court Mr Liebelt received an eight-month jail sentence which was suspended for two years after he committed an indecent act with a child under 16 years. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register and as part of those conditions had to report to police within seven days. On February 24 he attended the Hastings police station but refused to answer questions or provide details . Mr Liebelt was bailed to appear in the Frankston Magistrates Court on April 13 but failed to appear and a warrant was issued for his arrest. In mid-July Portland police arrested Mr Liebelt at his mother's Arthur Street home. She said he had been staying with her for a couple of months. A police officer involved in the case fears Mr Liebelt has no intentions of complying with the requirements of the sex offenders' register and is in denial about being on the register. Mr Liebelt told the court he wanted to make a clean start and did not believe he should plead guilty to something he didn't do. He said reports had found he was not a predator or paedophile . "I'm no trouble to society. It was a huge mistake on my behalf," Mr Liebelt said. Mr Klestadt said the accused man had to abide by the legislation but had demonstrated a lack of understanding about those requirements. "I'm not satisfied that if you were released on bail there is a reasonable chance you would turn up in court ," he said. http://www.standard.net.au/news/local/news/general/portland-sex-offender-in-custody-after-refusing-to-obey-register-conditions/2265351.aspx

TING LUEY (VIC- Melbourne)|64 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced August 2012, in the Victorian County Court, to 5 months jail - suspended for 12 months.|Ting Luey- Pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an intellectually disabled woman at a Melbourne residential facility in October 2010. Man avoids jail for disabled woman assault- (17-8-2012) A CARER who forced his hand down the shirt of an intellectually disabled woman at a Melbourne residential facility has avoided jail. Ting Luey, 64, was sentenced to five months' jail, suspended for 12 months, in the Victorian County Court on Friday after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting the woman after she declined his advances. Judge Michael Bourke said the assault occurred late at night in October 2010, once the other residents had gone to bed after Luey had accompanied them to a disco. Luey, a relief carer at the residential facility for disabled people in Melbourne's east, had been watching television alone with the victim when he asked her to undo her bra. When she refused, he put his hand down her shirt. The victim told him to leave her alone and went to bed, but reported the incident the next morning. Luey initially denied any wrongdoing but pleaded guilty this week before his trial began. Since the incident his victim had become anxious, less trusting, fearful of change and nervous when left alone, the court heard. She wanted an apology from her attacker. Judge Bourke said Luey's claim that he had been fatigued after working a long shift was "clearly not a good moral or logical explanation". "This was an offence which was committed upon a vulnerable person within her home and within a setting which was supposed to protect her," he said. "Others must know that vulnerable persons such as (the victim) must be and feel protected from offending such as this." Judge Bourke said Luey was a man of previous good character who was ashamed and remorseful for what he had done. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/national/man-avoids-jail-for-disabled-woman-assault/story-e6frfku9-1226452570718#ixzz24EJbdSst
GERARD DONEHUE LYONS (VIC- Geelong/ Corio)|31 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Gerard Lyons. REGISTERED sex offender - placed on the Sex Offender's Register for life in 2006. Report breach claims (17-2-2012) A REGISTERED sex offender, residing in Geelong, has been released on bail after allegedly breaching his reporting conditions. Detective Senior Constable Paul Michell told Geelong Magistrates' Court yesterday that Gerard Donehue Lyons, 31, of Corio, had failed to notify police of his change of address, phone number and employment in accordance with his requirements under the Sex Offenders' Register. Lyons is also charged with unlicensed driving, exceeding .05 and failing to appear. Sen-Constable Michell said Lyons had extensive criminal and driving histories and the latest offending would breach two suspended jail sentences. "He is currently employed as a 'truck jockey' with a major furniture retailer in Geelong," the officer said. Sen-Constable Michell said Lyons was placed on the Sex Offender's Register for life in 2006 and has two prior breaches of conditions in 2006 and 2007. Michael Brugman, for Lyons, said his client was in the throes of a violent relationship when the driving offences occurred. He said Lyons' failure to appear might have something to do with the fact his past five court appearances had resulted in jail. Mr Brugman said his client was now employed and had stable accommodation with his brother. Lyons will reappear in Geelong Magistrates' Court on a date to be fixed. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2012/02/17/308261_news.html

One man shouting rot in hell you arsehole as Macfie was escorted out of the courtroom. -below- News (3-6-2011)- A FORMER Portland man convicted of committing a six-week campaign of sexual abuse against seven teenage girls in the Ballarat region will spend the next decade behind bars. John William Macfie, 70, was sentenced in the County Court in Ballarat yesterday, and will serve up to 15 years and seven months in prison with a non-parole period of 11 years. A jury on Tuesday found Macfie guilty of 42 out of 52 charges. Sitting in the dock at the back of the court yesterday, Macfie remained unmoved when Judge Ross Howie delivered his sentence. A number of victims and their parents attended the sentencing, with one man shouting rot in hell you arsehole as Macfie was escorted out of the courtroom. The rest sat facing forwards, choosing not to take one last look at the man who devastated their lives. The court heard Macfie was already a convicted sex offender who had previously served 10 years in prison after two similar series of sexual offences involving girls as young as 12. In April and May last year he sexually abused seven girls aged between 13 and 16, who all went to a secondary college in the Ballarat region. Judge Howie summarised Macfies offending, telling the court he had preyed upon needy and vulnerable girls, and used a fictitious and bizarre story about becoming members of a secret mafia to trick them into performing sexual acts with him. He said Macfie had bribed the girls with promises of money and gifts including iPhones, cigarettes, fake identification, drugs and alcohol. Judge Howie said Macfie had told the girls about becoming princesses and warned them not to tell anyone about his crimes because they were being followed. Macfie warned one girl she would be killed if she told the police. Judge Howie said Macfie welcomed new girls with hugs, kisses and packages of goods, and persuaded two girls to stay overnight in his home. The court heard the six-week ordeal ended on May 18 last year when a school principal contacted police after making enquiries about the girls absences. When delivering his sentence, Judge Howie said the main purpose of his decision was to protect the community, and that Macfies history of offending and foolish conduct in court suggested he had no idea of the harm he had caused to the victims and their families. You showed a complete lack of remorse for your crimes, Judge Howie said. http://www.standard.net.au/news/local/news/general/exportland-paedophile-jailed-for-15-years/2183719.aspx|/images/sketch_john_macfie_2.jpg
EDWARD MAMO (VIC)|68 yrs old (2013)|Sentence in Feb 2013 to 2yrs 3months jail/ 1 1/2yrs non parole.|Edward Mamo - Catholic brother/ Former bus driver and hockey coach at Hamiltons Monivae College in regional Victoria..Pleaded guilty to 7 charges of unlawful and indecent assault with a child under 16.. He was in his 30s when he abused his young victims (boarders/students) at the college between 1976 and 1988. "Catholic brother jailed over indecent assaults on students" (22-2-2013) A former Catholic brother who spanked the bare backsides of students under the guise of punishment has been jailed. Edward Mamo, 68, would often touch himself and make comments to the students while hitting them, the Victorian County Court heard. Judge Julian Leckie said Mamo, who worked as a bus driver and sports coach at Monivae College in Hamilton, was guilty of a serious breach of trust. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/molester-motivated-by-discipline-court-told/story-fnat79vb-1226583506092 "Molester motivated by discipline, court told" (20-2-2013) A catholic brother who molested young boarders at a regional Victorian college has told a court he was motivated by a need to discipline them. Edward Mamo, 68, was not a teacher at Hamiltons Monivae College, but as a bus driver and hockey coach had direct involvement with students. The County Court heard today that almost all of Mamos victims were being disciplined at the time they were molested. In one incident Mamo had ordered a young student to the college laundry for punishment and, after belting him with a strap, fondled his genitals. On another occasion a student who had been giving cheek during a school trip was held back on the bus by Mamo and molested. Mamo has pleaded guilty to seven charges of unlawful and indecent assault with a child under 16. He was in his 30s when he abused his young victims between 1976 and 1988. Defence counsel Peta Murphy, for Mamo, said her client didnt dispute the sexual element of the offending. But his motivation, in his mind at the time, was discipline, Ms Murphy said. The claim was rejected by Judge Julian Leckie, who said Mamo had used discipline as a guide to then indulge a sexual interest he had. He was indulging some perverted sexual abuse on his part, he said. Judge Leckie said their might have been a minor infraction by Mamos young victims but said there was no evidence they had ever done anything major. There may have been some justification for punishing the student. He then used that opportunity to indulge (his) sexual interest by making the boy take his pants down, his underpants down, bending him over and then strapping him. Crown prosecutor Kieran Gilligan called for a jail term of up to four years because of Mamos gross breach of trust (and) cynical exploitation of (his victims) for his sexual gratification. They were students at the college, and soft targets in that respect, he said. Mamo was released on bail and will be sentenced on Friday. http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/molester-motivated-by-discipline-court-told/story-e6frfkp9-1226581941977|/images/edward_mamo_2.jpg
NEVILLE MANSFIELD (VIC - Shepparton)|52 yrs old (2013)|Sentenced in the Victorian County Court, to 16 years jail - 12 yrs non parole.|Neville Mansfield - Convicted Rapist. "Vic rapist appeals against conviction" (28-5-2013) A man who bound, gagged and blindfolded a six-year-old boy before raping his mother in a home invasion is appealing his conviction and sentence in Victoria's highest court. Neville Mansfield, 52, entered the woman's Shepparton home in 1993 through an unlocked door and held a knife to her son's throat. He tied the hands of the boy, his 11-year-old sister and their elderly babysitter, put socks in their mouths and pillowcases over their heads before raping their mother in another room and threatening to kill them all. He became a suspect 14 years later, after having to provide a DNA sample for another matter. A Victorian County Court jury heard DNA taken from the home was over 14 trillion times more likely to be Mansfield's than anyone else's. In the Victorian Court of Appeal on Tuesday, Mansfield's lawyer Dermot Dann said the jury was not properly instructed on how to deal with the DNA evidence and factors that could affect the likelihood it belonged to Mansfield. He said Mansfield's sentence of 16 years with a minimum of 12 years should be slashed because it was excessive and did not take into account the fact that Aboriginal men had an average life expectancy of 67. "Each year of the sentence does represent a significant proportion of this man's remaining life," he said. Crown prosecutor Tom Gyorffy SC said the judge had made it "absolutely plain" to the jury what they had to consider in dealing with the DNA evidence. He said the case against Mansfield was strong and the jury had been aware that there had been other suspects who had been eliminated. "This was a very comprehensive investigation. It's not just a case of saying this man is it," Mr Gyorffy said. He said the overall sentence was appropriate for what was a very serious offence. The appeal court judges reserved their decision. http://au.news.yahoo.com/latest/a/-/latest/17359727/vic-rapist-appeals-against-conviction/

Theatre worker jailed over 27,500 images of children (15-9-2011) A FORMER artistic contributor to the Commonwealth and Olympic Games, highly regarded for his work on many Melbourne theatrical events, has been jailed for more than three years for handling 27,500 items of child pornography. US-born Albert Joseph Martinez, 63, a sought-after puppet and props maker, pleaded guilty to charges of publishing or transmitting via the internet and possession of 26,837 child porn images and 702 videos, many depicting children younger than 10 and including some with the highest category of violent or abusive content. Martinez, who oversaw some artistic aspects of the Sydney Olympic and Melbourne Commonwealth Games, also worked with major ballet and theatrical companies and had taught for a number of years at the Victorian College of the Arts, the County Court heard. His involvement in sharing grotesque child pornography images came to police attention in Victoria after child exploitation experts in the US monitored his visits to known websites. Martinez told police he had become addicted to pornography, accessing it for up to six hours a day, and despite him finding some of the images abhorrent and the child victims distressed, he passed on the material to other offenders. In sentencing Martinez to three years and four months' jail, with a minimum of two years and three months, Judge Sue Pullen said he treated the children and the images "as a commodity to exchange". "You were creating a market to produce pornography." Judge Pullen said Martinez, who had worked on productions including The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, had expressed "shame and remorse" for his offending, now recognised it was not a victimless crime and said his reputation had suffered a "significant fall from grace". http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/olympics-worker-jailed-for-child-porn/story-fn7x8me2-1226137211004

"The punishment only equals $250 per child" ??? - Tough mandatory sentencing is needed for Paedophiles Australia Wide - MAKO. "Indecent assault charge dismissed for Ballarat paedophile" (14-7-2013) A convicted Ballarat paedophile, accused of indecently assaulting an intellectually disabled woman inside a residential care home, had his case dismissed yesterday on the basis of consent. Gary McErvale, 61, appeared in Ballarat Magistrates Court where one charge of indecent assault without consent was dismissed by the magistrate, Angela Bolger. McErvale had pleaded not guilty to the charge. Police had alleged McErvale, who was convicted in 2003 of molesting four girls under the age of seven, indecently assaulted a woman inside a facility. Giving evidence to the court, Detective Senior Constable Jacinta Ford said McErvale was arrested on February 7 this year after a witness allegedly saw him with his hand up the dress of another resident. An employee from the home giving evidence to the court said he allegedly saw McErvale indecently assaulting the woman after the first witness alerted him to what was going on. The court heard the complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is intellectually disabled and has the brain capacity of a 10-year-old. After an almost five-hour hearing, Ms Bolger said she was left with no other option than to dismiss the charge. The charge simply cannot be proved beyond reasonable doubt, Ms Bolger said. While agreeing the act was indecent, Ms Bolger said the issue of consent from the complainant couldnt be proved by the prosecution. McErvales defence lawyer Danielle Lamovie had argued throughout the hearing that consent from the complainant was an issue. The court heard that the complainant can express what she likes and what she doesnt like, Ms Lamovie said. There is no evidence of non-consent. http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/1706494/indecent-assault-charge-dismissed-for-ballarat-paedophile/?cs=62|/images/mcervale2.jpg

Youth worker gave sex victim money- (5-2-2007) A Christian youth worker who had sex with a 13-year-old girl gave his victim money so that she would not go to the police. The County Court heard that Mark McGorum gave the girl $40 a week for four months and an extra $150 so she could visit her grandmother. Prosecutor Mark Gibson said McGorum, who was a youth leader at a church in Hoppers Crossing, had also bought the girl cigarettes, taken her to the movies and paid for her and her brother to attend church activities. "The accused stated that he was happy to give her this money so that the incidents were not reported to the police," Mr Gibson said. "The complainant's parents had trusted him with their children  he agreed that he had broken that trust." McGorum, 35, of Werribee, pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual penetration of a child under 16 between January 2002 and February 2003. Mr Gibson said the charges were "sanitised", with the victim, now 18, having alleged there were "many, many, many" other occurrences. The court heard she refused to testify about the further alleged incidents. Forensic psychologist Patrick Newton said McGorum had poor insight, showed little empathy for the victim and was at moderate risk of reoffending. Defence lawyer Leighton Gwynn said his client was remorseful. Mr Gibson said these types of cases were on the rise. "There needs to be  a clear message to the community, in particular people who are occupying positions of care, supervision or authority, that the courts won't tolerate this behaviour." Judge Jennifer Coate granted bail to McGorum until sentencing this month. He will be registered as a sex offender and must report for life. http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/youth-worker-gave-sex-victim-money/2007/02/04/1170523961009.html
COLIN GEORGE McKANE  (VIC- Hamilton / Geelong- 2011)|53 yrs old (2011) |Sentenced in the County Court on the 5-10-1998 to 10.5 yrs jail - 9 yrs non parole. |Abducted a 10 yr old girl from a Christmas street party and molested her. Her friend's screaming made him release her. McKane was on parole for other sex offences at the time. Has a 30yr record for random attacks on girls aged 7-16 yrs old. His priors include: The bashing and raping of a 16 yr old girl and a sex attack on a 9 yr old girl. News (11-10-2012)- "Serial child sex offender tried to bury girl alive" A predatory child sex offender who was jailed this week once tried to bury a girl alive and was recommended for indefinite imprisonment by the public prosecutor. Colin George McKane was sentenced on Tuesday to nine months in jail for tracking down minors for sex after seeing their photographs in a newspaper. At the time he was the subject of a supervision order imposed after he finished a sentence for kidnapping and molesting a 10-year-old girl. At his 1998 trial for the abduction and molestation, the Office of Public Prosecutions asked Judge Leo Hart to declare McKane a dangerous offender, so he could be sentenced to prison indefinitely. Judge Hart refused and sentenced McKane to nine years in prison. At that trial, it emerged that McKane had a long and brutal history of sexual abuse of children, a record police described as one of the worst they had ever seen. He had previously been jailed, in 1995, for phoning children whose picture he had seen in the paper. This is Colin George McKane, the paedophile police believe should never be released, this newspapers John Silvester wrote at the time. For at least 25 years McKane  has been every parents nightmare. He has attempted to bury a girl alive, abducted girls from the street and made hundreds of obscene phone calls that left children terrified. He refused prison sex-therapy programs, flouted parole conditions and reoffended every time he was released from prison. In a confidential police report in 1992, McKane was described as a real threat to females and children. He is a definite sexual deviant and while serving his last prison sentence for rape, declined  medical assistance and counselling. In 1977, a psychiatrist wrote: I think he needs to be hospitalised for further psychiatric assessment in his own interest and also in the public interest. The parole board found he was a long-term recidivist sexual offender, progressing from indecent exposure to indecent assault. Offences had involved knives, scissors and once an unloaded rifle  also notable has been his lack of impulse control, no sense of responsibility, of right and wrong and no remorse. In 1984, McKane bashed a 16-year-old girl with a tyre brace in Warrnambool as she was walking home, put her in his car, dragged her to a beach, assaulted her, then dumped her in a hole, covering her with bracken and debris. The girl escaped while McKane was away. Later that night, when police were examining the scene, McKane returned  with a shovel. Police believed he was going to bury her. http://www.theherald.com.au/story/390216/serial-child-sex-offender-tried-to-bury-girl-alive/?cs=7 McKane Recently reoffended- News (16-11-2011)- "Sex offender gets three years jail for phone calls" A convicted sex monster who tracked down teenage girls in Geelong and made obscene phone calls to them has been sentenced to three years jail. Colin George McKane, aged in his 50s, appeared at a closed hearing in Geelong Magistrates' Court on Monday where he pleaded guilty to 10 Commonwealth charges of using a carriageway to harass, offend or menace. It is unsure why the court was ordered to be closed. The filth-laden calls were made in June this year, after McKane tracked down his victims from their pictures in the Geelong Advertiser. At a hearing in Geelong Magistrates' Court on June 22 this year, Detective Senior Constable Amanda Evans told how one Geelong family answered the phone on June 18 to an "old sounding" man asking to speak to their daughter. Sen-Constable Evans said the girl hung up after the man suggested a sex act. The court was told that, on the same day, another family received a phone call from a man wanting to speak to their daughter. "The following day a man phoned the home of a third girl, asking her age and requesting phone sex," Sen-Constable Evans said. "Police were contacted and the man was later arrested and charged." The court heard McKane was found in possession of three mobile phones, a Geelong phone book and a copy of the newspaper open at the page where the victims appeared. In 1998, McKane, who by then had a 25-year history of random attacks on more than a dozen girls aged from seven to 16, was jailed for 10 1/2 years for sexually molesting a 10-year-old girl. A County Court was told how McKane had snatched the young girl during a street party and indecently assaulted her, before her terrified screams forced him to release her. He had been paroled just five months earlier after serving a four-year jail term for offences in 1995, when he made threatening and obscene phone calls to girls he had seen pictured in newspapers. In the 1980s McKane was jailed for 10 years for an attack on a 16-year-old girl during which he knocked her unconscious, raped her and left her for dead. That crime was committed two months after his release from a five-year jail term for a sex attack on a nine-year-old girl. A County Court judge at the time said McKane committed many of his crimes in public places and did not appear deterred by detection and punishment. http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2011/11/16/291461_news.html
RICKY DAVID McLENNAN (VIC- Bendigo)|50 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 8-3-2012, in the Bendigo County Court, to 15 yrs and 4 months jail - 12 yrs non parole.|Ricky McLennan/ owner of Epsom business Cowboy World now known as "Wrangler Shop". Multible counts of sexual penetration of a child under the age of 16 - indecent act with a child under 16 - child pornography - indecent assault. Repeat Offender - in the Melbourne County Court on 26 April 2001, convicted of 5 counts of indecent act with a child under the age of 16, and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months. Victims were 3 girls. News (9-3-2012)- "Sex predator Ricky McLennan jailed for 15 years"- A COUNTY Court judge broke down yesterday after sentencing sexual predator Ricky Dave McLennan to 15 years and four months jail for a series of sex offences against young women. Judge Irene Lawson was choked with tears when she told each of McLennans female victims how brave they had been. The thing I will take away from it is the courage of the girls, she said. You all strike me as very remarkable girls. Over a six-week trial, which included three separate indictments and two juries, McLennan was found guilty of 19 counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16, two counts of attempted sexual penetration of a child under 16, four counts of committing an indecent act with a child under 16, one count of indecent assault and three child pornography charges. The charges related to four victims, the youngest 11 at the time. The incidents stretched back to 2005 when McLennan groomed two sisters  aged 13 and 15  for a sexual relationship. McLennan, owner of Epsom business Cowboy World now known as Wrangler Shop, pleaded not guilty to all charges. He pleaded guilty to the final indecent assault charge after two separate juries found him guilty of 29 offences spanning the first two indictments. Ms Lawson said apart from that late plea there was nothing she could take into account to lessen McLennans sentence. A clear message needs to be sent by this court that offences against children in this matter will be handled with the utmost severity, she said. McLennan was sentenced to 15 years and four months jail, with a non-parole period of 12 years. He was sentenced as a serious sex offender and will be placed on the sex offender register for life. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/sex-predator-ricky-mclennan-jailed-for-15-years/2482556.aspx|/images/ricky_mclennan_2.jpg

Crime Victims Support Association http://www.cvsa.asn.au/index.html News (22-1-2013)- "Fighting for just sentencing"- Today Tonight For a significant number of prisoners parole is being used as a second chance to offend, leading for victims' families to call for a system overhaul. Those whose loved ones were murdered by parolees are left devastated by crimes they believe should never have been committed. Locked up then let out, career criminals are awarded 'get out of jail free cards' time and time again, only to continue to re-offend while on parole. The aim of the Parole Board is to release offenders who are no longer considered a risk to society, yet almost half the time they get it wrong. According to the Bureau of Statistics, within two years of being released 41 per cent of prisoners are back behind bars. Shirley and Allan Irwin's two daughters were murdered by a career criminal while out on parole. 23-year-old Colleen and 21-year-old Laura were renting their first apartment together since leaving home. What the girls didn't know was the man living next door was about to savagely cut short their dreams, their hopes and their lives. On a Friday night in 2006 in Melbourne's west, he cornered them in their home, brutally raping and stabbing them to death. Allan and Shirley cling to their memories but believe this unbearable heartache could have been avoided. Murderer William John Watkins's record dated backed to 1985 and included convictions for rape, aggravated burglary and assaulting police. The maximum sentence is more than 40 years but he was given four years and released after just two and a half. "Had she known he was on parole there's a fair chance she could have gone to the police station and said 'this bloke is harassing me'," Shirley said. Watkins was fatally shot by police three days after the murders, when he bashed an officer in WA after being pulled over for stealing petrol. Allen and Shirley were thankful they didn't have to go through the justice system to see Watkins punished, but the same can't be said for Noel and Beverley McNamara. Their 29-year-old daughter Tracey was raped and bashed. "She went out that night and the next thing we get a call from the Ferntree Gully hospital saying she was unconscious," Noel said. She died after two days on life support. Rather than serving twenty years for rape and another 25 years for murder, her killer and rapist Noel Meyers, was sentenced to twelve years and freed after ten. "I don't think I've ever felt so angry in my life," Noel said. Helen Wicking's daughter Joanne was murdered, brutally tortured and stabbed by Sean Maraffko - a murder committed just three weeks after Maraffko was released from prison. "A violent prior history and he was just allowed to get out early and free," Helen said. However criminologist Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University, defends the system. "My observations of the various jurisdictions around Australian indicate that sentences are becoming longer - and have been for a long time - and parole is increasingly becoming more difficult to obtain," Professor Smallbone said. Noel McNamara wants concurrent sentencing scrapped, a criminal's prior convictions released publicly, and a minimum sentence for serious offences. "The murderer could have murdered before and they are not allowed to know about it - and that's wrong," Noel said. A recent police survey in WA found that 98 per cent had little faith in the judiciary, citing the sentences handed down by magistrates and judges is not tough enough. We have asked the Attorney-Generals for their response to this story and we plan to follow up. http://au.news.yahoo.com/today-tonight/lifestyle/article/-/15923667/fighting-for-just-sentencing/ News (1-7-2006)- "Outspoken Voice Of The Victims" http://www.cvsa.asn.au/mystory.html R.I.P-Tracey McNamara http://www.cvsa.com.au/?page_id=393

Andrew Simon Montgomery, 38, of Princes Highway, pleaded guilty in Warrnambool County Court on August 10 to one charge of sexual penetration of a child aged under 16 years. Sentencing was adjourned until yesterday so Judge Mark Taft could get sentencing statistics from the time of the offence. Judge Taft yesterday said that after anxious consideration and some misgiving he had determined to hand down a wholly suspended jail sentence. He sentenced Montgomery to two years imprisonment but suspended the jail term for three years. Judge Taft said the substantial delay, withdrawal of the complaint and revitalisation of the police investigation and Montgomerys guilty plea were all significant factors. He told Montgomery that he hoped he took notice of the chilling account of the victim tendered to the court through the victim impact statement. She should not have had to go through that experience. You can consider yourself fortunate that you are not going to jail today, he said. Judge Taft said the victims statement was a distressing document and the impact of the offending had been profound. The woman said in the statement she had sought much help from medical professionals after spending about 10 years trying to bury herself in alcohol and drugs. She said she would not wish what had happened to her on her worst enemy and that she never wanted anyone else to be Montgomerys victim. Montgomery was also placed on the sex offenders register for 15 years News (10-8-2012)- "Man pleads guilty to sex with under-age girl in 1997" A Tyrendarra man who admitted having sex with a 15-year-old girl in 1997 has had his case adjourned so a judge can gain more information about sentencing.

"Prison for sex fiend" (17-11-2010) A repeat sex offender has been jailed for almost two years after pleading guilty to a number of offences. Geoffrey Graeme Murray, 27, of Warrnambool pleaded guilty to theft, obtaining property by deception, failing to appear on bail, committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 and three counts of being a registered sex offender who failed to comply with reporting obligations. He was convicted and sentenced to a total effective term of 22 months imprisonment with one year non parole and has also been added to the sex offenders register for life. Murray has already spent 105 days in custody which will count as time served. Previously convicted of committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 years in 2004, Murray was placed on the sex offenders' register. There are a number of obligations through that registration and he has to report any unsupervised access with children. But during July and August Murray was having regular contact with girls as young as 14 without reporting and the court heard on at least one occasion introduced a girl to another registered sex offender. In August, Murray drove two teenage girls to Melbourne and bought them alcohol. When one of the girls became heavily intoxicated and was falling asleep, Murray undressed her and indecently assaulted her. The court heard the removal of the girls clothing happened more than once despite attempts made by the other girl to prevent it. Magistrate Ron Saines described Murrays behaviour as predatory. Noting this was the sixth time Murray had been sentenced for similar sex-related matters and the 18th time he had been sentenced for theft and dishonesty-related offences. Mr Saines said the court had to have a strong emphasis on denunciation, deterrence and punishment. Mr Saines also ordered Murrays drivers licence be suspended for two years. He was also ordered to pay $200 compensation to Cash Converters where he sold a stolen bicycle. * The South Western Centre Against Sexual Assault can be contacted on 5564 4144 or after hours on 1800 806 292. http://www.standard.net.au/story/787579/prison-for-sex-fiend/|/images/Geoffrey_graeme_murray.jpg
JARROD NADORT (VIC- Bendigo, Lockwood)|24 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 5-5-2011, in the Melbourne County Court to 10 yrs jail - 7 yrs non parole.|Found guilty by a jury of 2 counts of Rape and one of assault. Violently raped and assaulted a 15 yr old girl. Pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16. Victim was a 12 yr old girl. See Co-offender - Dale Goss. News (6-5-2011)- "Rapist gets 10 years"- LOCKWOOD man Jarrod Nadort has been sentenced to 10 years jail for violently raping and assaulting a 15-year-old girl. The sentence also takes into account two charges of sexual penetration of a child under 16, relating to a 12-year-old girl on a different occasion. Nadort, 24, was sentenced in the Melbourne County Court yesterday morning. During his trial in Bendigo last month, the court was told Nadort had been caught in the act when another person walked into the spare bedroom and found him kneeling over the teenage victim who was crying and screaming. A female witness told the court she saw the victim try to crawl away from Nadort. Nadort did not deny having sex with the teenager, but said it was consensual. He was found guilty by a jury of two counts of rape and one of assault. In a victim impact statement, the victim described the pain and anguish the rape had caused. I felt that I had a tattoo across my forehead after Jarrod had attacked me and I felt vulnerable because of it, she said. I would try and act tough so I didnt seem vulnerable to the outside world, but really I was feeling anything but tough. I felt easy targeted, naive, empty, used, violated and fearful. The scars from this incident may not be visible, but I live with the pain, the mental and emotional scars every day. The rape occurred at a 21st birthday party in February last year. Four months later Nadort twice had sex with a 12-year-old girl in a bungalow at his parents house. Nadort pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16. His friend, Dale Goss, 25, of Golden Square, pleaded guilty to one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16. At the pre-sentence hearing for all matters, prosecutor Patrick Southey called for a sentence of seven to 10 years with a non-parole period of five to seven years for Nadort, and two to three years jail with a non-parole period of 12 to 18 months for Goss. Judge Rachelle Lewitan said Nadorts offending was very serious, considering the violent nature of the rape and the fact that the victim was affected by alcohol. Nadort will be eligible for parole after seven years. Goss was sentenced to two years jail with a non-parole period of 16 months. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/rapist-gets-10-years/2154635.aspx News (3-6-2010)- "Girl, 12, rape charges"- TWO Bendigo men have been charged with the rape of a 12-year-old girl. The men, both in their 20s, are alleged to have consumed drugs and alcohol and had sex with the girl in full view of their friends despite her pleading with them to stop. Long Gully man Dale Goss, 25, and Jarrod Nadort, 23, of Lockwood were arrested on Tuesday after the girl made a report to police. They appeared in the Bendigo Magistrates Court yesterday afternoon for a bail application. It was opposed by police on the grounds that the charges were of such a serious nature that the men were considered a flight risk. Prosecutor, Leading Senior Constable Dave Somerton said police also believed the men would interfere with prosecution witnesses and endanger the safety of the victim if allowed back into the community. Despite their concerns Magistrate Jennifer Tregent granted bail. Detective Senior Constable David Newman from the sexual crimes squad said Goss and Nadort picked up a group of people, including the girl, from KFC in Bendigo on Saturday night. He said the group then drove to Nadort's bungalow at his parents' house where they consumed alcohol and the two men smoked cannabis. While in the Bungalow, the court was told, Nadort began touching the girl and had sex with her on a bed. ``She was telling him to stop, she was trying to push him away,'' Detective Senior Constable Newman said. Nadort is alleged to have had sex with the girl a second time that night. He is alleged to have followed the girl out to a rear shed, pushed her onto a mattress and tried to remove her clothes. When she struggled he allegedly slapped her across the face and then had sex with her. Goss is alleged to have had sex with the girl on a couch inside the bungalow. Detective Senior Constable Newman said the girl awoke to find Goss standing over her naked. He then removed her clothes and lifted her on top of him while he sat on the couch and they had sex, the court heard. Two other people who were present at the time have made statements to police alleging they witnessed Nadort and Goss have sex with the girl. Both men deny the allegations. Nadort is charged with two counts of rape, two counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16, one count of common law assault and one count of indecent assault. Goss is charged with one count of rape, one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and one count of common law assault. They will return to court in September. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/girl-12-rape-charges/1848098.aspx|/images/jarrod_nadort_2.jpg

Judge Carolyn Douglas, sentencing him to 13 years with a minimum of eight, said it was a difficult and unusual case because Ostler had otherwise led a good and law-abiding life. He had committed no crimes before or since the rapes. "There is no issue in this case that you have totally rehabilitated," Judge Douglas said. "There is no dispute that you genuinely do not have a good memory of this incident." Ostler did not know the occupants of the house and an extensive police investigation at the time failed to identify an offender. "In 1985, you provided your fingerprints as that was a requirement of obtaining a firearms licence," the judge said. "In early 2009, the investigation in relation to these matters was reviewed by the sexual crimes squad. "The fingerprints found at the scene . . . were your fingerprints. Subsequently, DNA samples were taken." Judge Douglas said the attacks continued to have an impact on Ostler's victims. "It is clear that you put these people through a terrifying ordeal," she said. "People are entitled to feel safe in our society in their home. The intrusion into the family home and the offences you committed are particularly serious given the young age of the complainant, the fact that you raped and indecently assaulted (the woman) in the presence of her partner." http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/dna-breaks-rape-case-after-22-years/story-fn7x8me2-1226287708783 http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/pillowcase-rapist-jailed-22-years-on-20120302-1u7dt.html

"Pedophile priest Terrence Melville Pidoto refused appeal request" (27-6-2009) A priest jailed for more than seven years for raping and sexually abusing four boys has been refused leave to appeal his convictions. A Victorian County Court jury in 2007 found Catholic priest Terrence Melville Pidoto guilty of 11 charges including rape and indecently assaulting a child under 16. He was jailed later that year for seven years and three months, and ordered to serve a minimum of five years before being eligible for parole. Today, the Court of Appeal refused him leave to appeal his convictions. His lawyers had argued the judge made errors during his trial. But Justices Peter Buchanan, Frank Vincent and Julie Dodds-Streeton said the trial judge had acted appropriately. We are far from persuaded that any of the verdicts could be regarded as unreasonable,'' they said in their judgment. Pidoto was ordained in 1971 aged 26 and began his sordid sex activity just a year later, the jury heard during his trial. They heard he took one 14-year-old boy to the Corpus Christi seminary, in Melbourne's east, where he raped and abused him on several occasions between 1972 and 1973. Assaults on two 15-year-old boys occurred at St Clare's Catholic parish in Box Hill in 1978 and 1979, while Pidoto was an assistant parish priest. A 12-year-old boy became Pidoto's fourth victim after the priest officiated at the boy's sister's wedding. Pidoto had denied all charges. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/pedophile-priest-terrence-melville-pidoto-refused-appeal-request/story-e6frf7jo-1225755261285 http://www.cvsa.com.au/?p=452 http://brokenrites.alphalink.com.au/nletter/page136-pidoto.html|/images/terrence_melville_pidoto.jpg

EVGENY POTASHNIK (VIC- Bentleigh)|31 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to a 5 months jail - suspended for a yr and an 18-month community service order.|Evgeny Potashnik - pleaded guilty to 2 counts of knowingly possessing child pornography. Online pedophile cheats jail- (18-3-2011) THE Australian-based "security adviser" to the largest online pedophile network ever busted has escaped a jail term after being sentenced to community service for his senior role in a ring that traded millions of child-exploitation images, with some made to order. Melbourne-based IT consultant Evgeny Potashnik, 30, was one of four Australians to hold high-level positions in the international "boylover" online forum, which had more than 70,000 members in at least 30 countries. An Australian Federal Police-led investigation, started three years ago, has led to the arrest of 184 people - including 31 Australians - over that time as well as the rescue of 230 children from suspected abuse. Four of those children are from Australia, with police around the world still trying to locate victims - some of whom are infants and have experienced the "worst of the worst" in abuse. Police also suspect members were running orphanages in Thailand, where an 84-year-old Australian was tracked through the forum and charged with physically abusing children. Details of the three-year investigation and the subsequent charges were announced late on Wednesday night in The Hague, with AFP commander Grant Edwards joining his European counterparts in detailing the investigation involving Australian police infiltrating the sophisticated network. Police said the Netherlands-based forum, believed to have been set up in 2002 and shut down in the bust, purported to be a discussion-only website about member's shared sexual interest in boys. But the forum was a front for the trade in child-exploitation images and film. Mr Edwards said the network was run with a corporate-like structure, headed by an "owner" and a "board of directors". Members, including Potashnik and three other Australians, were promoted on the basis of their contribution to the website and contacts up the structure. Police said five Australian men arrested in NSW, Western Australian and Victoria were "high-ranking members" of the network, with two Sydney men holding the positions of director. One was charged with child sex tourism and child pornography offences, receiving a non-parole jail term of three years and seven months; the other was convicted of child abuse and producing child pornography and recently had his jail term reduced to six years and three months. Potashnik, of Bentleigh, pleaded guilty to two counts of knowingly possessing child pornography and was given a five-month sentence, suspended for a year and an 18-month community service order. Police said Potashnik was a senior member, using his IT training in the critical role of "security adviser" in trying to ensure the true nature of the forum was not exposed. Bravehearts executive director Hetty Johnston said Australian governments and courts needed to be tougher in dealing with online child exploitation. "The police do all this work to catch these people and then they walk - it is pathetic," she said. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/online-pedophile-cheats-jail/story-e6frg6nf-1226023543944 http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/melbourne-it-developer-sacked-over-child-porn/story-e6frgakx-1226025650460

Pryse indecently assaulted a 6 yr old girl, and a 7 yr old boy in 2004. News (4-5-2012)- "Sex offender denied bail in Bendigo court"- A convicted child sex offender who police believe is at very high risk of re-offending has had his bid for freedom denied. Peter Pryse, 35, faced Bendigo Magistrates Court yesterday charged with three contraventions of the sex offender register. Pryse was placed on the sex offender register for life after being convicted of indecently assaulting a six-year-old girl and a seven-year-old boy in 2004. Police arrested Pryse on Wednesday night when it was found he was living with two six-year-old boys, the sons of his partner, without notifying authorities. He had also failed to tell police about a motorbike he had purchased in 2008 and a change of address. Anyone on the sex offender register must comply with a strict set of conditions including notifying police of a long list of personal details. Police informant Detective Senior Constable Fisher said Pryse had broken these conditions twice before, once for failing to disclose personal details and another time for living with a child without notifying police. Pryces defence counsel Peter Baker said he understood his client would be facing jail time for this third breach but applied for bail until the matter was finalised. The ultimately unsuccessful application was opposed by police who argued Pryse was at serious risk of re-offending while on bail. The risk of a registered sex offender re-offending is categorised as low, medium and high  he is listed as very high, Detective Fisher said of Pryse. Detective Fisher said he was frightened by the fact Pryse had lived on and off with his girlfriend and her twin boys since the start of the year. He said Pryse had only told the woman half the story in regards to his offending. He told her he revealed himself to a young girl when he was drunk, he said. The reality, Magistrate Jennifer Tregent said, was much more concerning. Pryse was remanded to appear in the Bendigo Magistrates Court on May 30. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/crime-and-law/sex-offender-denied-bail-in-bendigo-court/2544214.aspx News (23-9-2010)- "Child sex offender cops fine"- A BENDIGO man with a conviction for sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl appeared in the magistrates court this week charged with failing to comply with the sex offender registry. In the early 2000s, Peter Pryse, 34, was convicted of four counts of committing an indecent act with, or in the presence of, a child under 16. He was sentenced to a minimum of three years in jail and listed as a serious sex offender. Earlier this year Pryse was interviewed by police and charged after he was found to have an unauthorised internet account. Serious sex offenders listed on the registry must notify their case worker of their personal circumstances, providing their address, phone number and internet provider details. They must also declare any access they have with children, whether its through a new relationship, their employment or their involvement with a sports club. Pryse did not notify his case worker about his internet access. He pleaded guilty to the charge in the Bendigo Magistrates Court on Tuesday. During the plea hearing, the court was told that in July Pryse had also been convicted of failing to notify the registry about his contact with a young child. There was no suggestion that he sexually assaulted the child. On that matter, Pryse was sentenced to one month in jail, suspended for 12 months. In regards to the internet matter, he was convicted and fined $1000. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/child-sex-offender-cops-fine/1950643.aspx|/images/peter_pryse_2.jpg
HUY QUACH (VIC- Box Hill)|36 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced in the County Court in April 2009, to 8 yrs/3 mths jail - 5 yrs non parole.|Former Policeman. News-Herald Sun (9-12-2009)- "Rapist cop awaits sentence"- A RAPIST cop had sex with a mentally ill woman while claiming to check on her welfare, a court has been told. Huy Vinch Quach, a former policeman stationed at Box Hill, went to the woman's house with two other officers after police were called to check on her whereabouts on July 3, 2007. The three police officers found the woman sleeping on the couch and her house in disarray with alcohol bottles strewn on the floor. The County Court heard Quach, 35, returned to the woman's house at the end of his shift and the woman woke to find him sitting in her lounge room. Quach, who had a 12-year career in the force, gave her some groceries and offered to take her out for a coffee. She accepted, but he instead drove her to his flat where they had sex. Afterwards, Quach drove her home, handed her $50 and said, "It's not illegal, but don't tell anyone." After the woman confided to her case manager, the incident was reported to police. Quach denied having sex with the woman, but admitted visiting her because he said, "I just felt sorry for her." Prosecutor Ray Elston, SC, said the former policeman knew his victim was vulnerable and had used his position of power to take advantage of her. Yesterday the former senior constable pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office. He will be sentenced by Judge Meryl Sexton today. In April, Quach was jailed after a County Court jury found him guilty of raping a woman while she was sleeping in May 2004. He also pleaded guilty to five counts of possessing a drug of dependence and one of misconduct in public office after he admitted using and giving out cocaine and ecstasy to young women at nightclubs. Quach was sacked by Victoria Police in March this year. For all crimes, he was sentenced to eight years and three months in prison with a minimum of five http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/former-policeman-huy-quach-admits-to-using-role-for-sex/story-e6frf7jo-1225968353237

News (17-5-2012)- A TEACHER who admitted to collecting and viewing more than 8000 images of child pornography has avoided a jail term. The move has sparked calls from child welfare campaigners to get tough on child porn offenders. Former Greensborough Secondary College teacher Henry Redden walked from court yesterday, despite pleading guilty to collecting the staggering stash and transmitting some of the disturbing material. The 60-year-old was suspended without pay from the college in December after federal police raided his home and seized laptops, a DVD and a hard drive full of pictures and videos of young children in explicit acts. Some of the material depicted graphic images of children engaged in sexual activity with adults. County Court Judge Howard Mason said apart from the offending Redden had led "an exemplary life'' and had a good reputation as a teacher. He said Redden, who had no prior criminal history, had struggled with his sexual identity and turned to child pornography because of confusion. "Your attention to the type of content you accessed over the internet developed from your sexual confusion, began with adult pornography, and expanded through confusion and voyeurism,'' he said. "Child pornography is a disgrace, and a great violation of a great moral obligation to humanity. "Children anywhere in the world should be afforded protection,'' he said. Judge Mason sentenced Redden to an 18 month Community Corrections Order and a 12-month $2000 bond. He was also placed on the sex offenders registry for 15 years. But Braveheart spokeswoman Hetty Johnson said the sentence didn't sent the right message to the community. "This sentence is an insult to the efforts of protecting children from these offenders. It is in no way appropriate,'' she said. "The message it sends is that watching children being sexually exploited is no big deal. This is a complete fallacy. "For each offender who watches this stuff, more and more children performing more and more hideous acts of child cruelty must be created.'' http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/true-crime-scene/teacher-who-collected-child-pornography-avoids-a-prison-sentence/story-fnat7dhc-1226359195194

Sexually assaulted two intellectually disabled sisters in 2009. News (9-8-2011)- "Man jailed by Victorian County Court for raping disabled sisters"- A MAN who sexually assaulted two intellectually disabled sisters and downloaded images onto his computer has been jailed. Stanley Rhode, 58, assaulted the women, aged 33 and 36, in 2009. He was jailed today for at least four years and three months. He also photographed one of his victims and downloaded the images onto his computer. A Victorian County Court jury found him guilty on two counts of rape and five counts of indecent assault. The court heard Rhode admitted to police he took advantage of one of the women, but claimed the encounters were consensual despite knowing the women were intellectually impaired. One of the women later said she was scared and had asked Rhode to stop, while the other said his actions made her feel "bad". In sentencing, Judge Tim Wood said Rhode's offending was serious as neither of the women were capable of giving informed consent. "You took advantage ... and breached the trust that these naive complainants placed in you," he said. The court heard Rhode was previously of good character and ashamed of the disgrace he had brought his family. His defence counsel had submitted Rhode was remorseful for the crimes, which were out of character, and he was unlikely to reoffend. Since being in jail he had found faith and was attending weekly church services. Rhode has been jailed for six-and-a-half years and will serve a minimum four years and three months. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/man-jailed-by-victorian-county-court-for-raping-disabled-sisters/story-e6frf7jo-1226111818524

DARREN GREGORY ROLLS (VIC- Pakenham)|40 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced Feb 2010, in the Vic County Court,to 6 yrs and 9 months jail - 4 yrs and 9 months non parole.|Darren Rolls, 38, pleaded guilty to 6 counts of performing an indecent act in the presence of a child under 16, and to loitering in the vicinity of children while a registered sex offender. When Police arrested Rolls in Wantirna South, he was hiding behind bushes wearing a pink g-string and pink thongs, watching a young girl play basketball. Jailed in 2003 for similar offences. News (23-3-2010)- MEANWHILE, a lingerie-clad serial flasher who exposed himself to school children in Mulgrave has been jailed after a two-year joint investigation by Knox and Monash detectives. Darren Gregory Rolls, 38, targeted schools, sporting events and parks across Melbournes eastern suburbs during 2007 and 2008, exposing himself on 23 occasions to children aged between eight and 15. This included exposing himself to two children near Brandon Park Primary School on February 7, 2008. He was jailed last month for six years and nine months, with a minimum of four years and nine months. Rolls pleaded guilty to six counts of performing an indecent act in the presence of a child under 16 and to loitering in the vicinity of children while a registered sex offender. His conviction came after a two-year investigation by the Knox Crime Investigation Unit (CIU) to catch the Pakenham man, supported by Glen Waverley, Nunawading and Dandenong CIUs. Knox detective Sen-Sgt Neil White said Rolls was arrested in June 2008 after parents at a Rowville under-age soccer game recognised him and phoned police with his car numberplate details. Its another good example of someone being caught by observation and just shows that parents still have to be on their guard when at events with their children, Sen-Sgt White said. Its a big relief to have someone like that off the street when you dont know what they are capable of, or what their next intention is in seeking their own gratification. Sen-Sgt White said when officers arrested Rolls in Wantirna South he was wearing a pink g-string and pink thongs, watching a young girl play basketball. Victim impact statements read out during Rollss trial highlighted how he had disturbed the children he targeted. It does traumatise them and have a marked impact on them, Sen-Sgt White said. Victorian County Court Judge John Smallwood said Rollss prior history, which dates back to 1993 and saw him jailed in 2003 for similar offences, was disturbing. http://leader-news.whereilive.com.au/news/story/prison-for-predator-of-oakleigh-huntingdale-children/ News (10-3-2010)- "Knox police effort nabs flasher"- http://berwick-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/knox-police-effort-nabs-flasher/
ANTHONY ROMA (VIC- Sunbury)|53 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced in July 2012, in the Victorian County Court, to 3 yrs and 4 months jail - 2 yrs and 3 months non parole.|Anthony Roma - pleaded guilty to offences including 7 counts of indecent assault, 2 charges of assault, 3 counts of indecent acts with a child, and supplying valium to a child. Vic child attacker gets 40 months' jail- (19-7-2012) A MELBOURNE man who indecently assaulted girls as young as 12 and a psychiatric patient who had been the victim of a previous sex attack has been jailed for three years and four months. Anthony Roma, 53, of Sunbury, pleaded guilty to indecent acts against three girls aged between 12 and 17. He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting a mentally ill sexual assault victim while he was a voluntary patient at a psychiatric unit in a Melbourne hospital. In the Victorian County Court on Thursday, Judge Jane Patrick said Roma's offending was brazen and disgusting, taking advantage of young girls in vulnerable positions. The offending began in 1996 when he attacked a 12-year-old girl. It continued in 2010 and 2011 when he repeatedly touched and kissed two teenage girls, sometimes while they were drunk. Following his arrest for those offences, Roma was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric unit at a Melbourne hospital where he repeatedly indecently assaulted another patient. Roma pleaded guilty to several charges, including seven counts of indecent assault, two charges of assault, three counts of indecent acts with a child, and supplying valium to a child. Judge Patrick said he lacked remorse, empathy and insight into his offending. "It's clear that your actions have caused great distress and harm to the victims," she said. "I accept that you were not going out into the world looking for victims but it is my view that you deliberately set out engaging in activities with young women in order to prey on them in a sexual way." Roma will spend a minimum two years and three months in jail and will report as a serious sex offender for life. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/breaking-news/vic-child-attacker-gets-40-months-jail/story-e6frea7l-1226429982027

Placed on the sex offenders' register for life.|15 sex offences, including sexual penetration of a child aged under 16 years, attempted sexual penetration of a child aged under 16, committing an indecent act with or in the presence of a child aged under 16, and indecently assaulting a child aged under 16. Victims were 4 young girls. News (6-10-2009)- "Sex Predator gets 14yrs"- A FORMER Heywood man will spend more than a decade in jail for sexually abusing four young girls. Peter James Rooks, 46, now of Duncans Road, Werribee South, appeared on trial in June and July this year at the Warrnambool County Court and consistently denied the 29 charges against him. Amid heightened security, including an increased police presence and officers with metal detectors, Judge Mark Taft yesterday sentenced Rooks to 14 years and six months in prison and ordered that the child abuser not be eligible for parole for 10 years and six months. Rooks' name was also placed on the sex offenders' register for life. After three days of deliberation in July, the jury of eight found Rooks guilty on 15 of the charges and not guilty of six offences. Judge Taft had ordered the jury find Rooks not guilty on eight of the 29 charges due to lack of evidence. The offences took place at Portland, Heywood and Cobram between January 1, 1986, and March 18, 2000, and included sexual penetration of a child aged under 16 years, attempted sexual penetration of a child aged under 16, committing an indecent act with or in the presence of a child aged under 16 and indecently assaulting a child aged under 16. Rooks remained stoney faced as Judge Taft read out the sentence to a packed courtroom in Warrnambool yesterday. A Portland district woman, whose attempted suicide led to a police investigation, told The Standard in July that she was relieved Rooks had been found guilty of sex offences. The woman said she was six or seven years old when the offending against her started. Police said the increased security was there in case of retribution attempts against Rook, but the large crowd present for the sentencing was well-behaved.   http://www.standard.net.au/news/local/news/general/sex-predator-gets-14-years/1641360.aspx
NEALE MARTIN ROSS (VIC- Melbourne) |48 yrs old (2011) | Sentenced Feb 2011, to 6 yrs jail - 4 yrs non parole. Had already spent 317 days in custody as of 23-2-2011.  |   News (25-2-2011)- "My family betrayed: Father tells of his childrens agony over being abused by mate"- The father of three of the victims, who cannot be named because of legal reasons, yesterday said the revelations of Ross offending had destroyed his family. Its ruined us ... the whole lot, he said. Who do we trust now? The kids are asking Is that it? Is that all he gets? The man said his family was struggling to overcome the offending. Its not good, he said. It was the ultimate act of betrayal by someone who I thought I knew. Judge Christopher ONeill said such offending was abhorrent and led to long-term damage to children and their families. He said the victim impact statements made chilling reading and highlighted the emotional damage caused. It is a serious aggravating feature that the victims were all children and aged between four and 15, Judge ONeill said. The father of the victims said he was disturbed by what he described as a lenient sentence. Hell be out in a little over three years and well still be struggling by what he has done, he said. God knows how much longer well be suffering ... well be living with this for the rest of our lives. Now its even worse because the justice system has let us down. Its not even a year per child that hes got left to serve. The father said Ross regularly visited the region on holiday after leaving the district about four years ago and had been living in Melbournes east. He said the offender was well known in the region, mainly through various sporting organisations, including Red Cliffs Football Club where his father Ian won McLeod Medals in 1955 and 1958. -Red More- http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/my-family-betrayed-father-tells-of-his-childrens-agony-over-being-abused-by-mate/2086654.aspx Neale Ross pleaded guilty to 6 counts of sexually penetrating a child under 16..15 counts of committing an indecent act with a child under 16..Victims were 4 girls (aged 4-15 yrs old).

Schnull was arrested during a joint state and federal police operation aimed at smashing a child pornography ring operating on Australia's eastern seaboard. He was one of 16 men arrested after police raided 19 properties in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT..Schnull is a self-employed installer of video and sound equipment. "Melb man jailed for baby porn possession" (13-2-2013) A Melbourne man who downloaded 45,000 "abhorrent" images of children engaged in sexual acts has been jailed for at least 16 months. Bernd Schnull, 62, was jailed for 34 months in the Victorian County Court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to accessing and possessing child porn. He had used peer-to-peer file sharing websites such as eMule to download 45,287 images and 1611 videos of child pornography, depicting victims aged between six months and 16 years old. Of those, nearly 200 images and 53 videos were considered to be in the worst category of child pornography. In sentencing Schnull, Judge Mark Gamble said some of the material showed child victims in situations where they would have felt pain, confusion and humiliation. "What was depicted was abhorrent," he said. Judge Gamble said he took into account Schnull's early guilty plea, previous good character, lack of prior convictions, good prospects of rehabilitation and the fact he had voluntarily sought professional help for his problem. The court heard Schnull gained no sexual arousal from the material, but did it out of boredom, claiming he was attracted to the novelty and driven by curiosity. He told police the images were like a "forbidden fruit", but he had no sexual attraction toward children and could not see himself performing those acts. Schnull, of Warranwood, will be released from jail after 16 months on a recognisance order which requires him to be of good behaviour for 18 months. http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/02/13/16/01/melb-man-jailed-for-baby-porn-possession "Man watched child porn for 'stress relief', court hears" (29-1-2013) A man caught with more than 45,000 images and 1600 videos of child pornography on his computer told police he had no sexual interest in children, a court heard today. Bernd Schnull, 62, of Warranwood, claimed watching child pornography helped to relieve his stress and anxiety over the problems he was having with his wife at home. Schnull would download the images in his study where you needed an access code to get into the room. He would come home from work and go straight on to his computer. Schnull pleaded guilty in the County Court on Tuesday to one count of accessing child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography involving children aged from six months to 16. He faces a maximum penalty of 15 years' jail. Prosecutor Samantha Holmes told the court Schnull had downloaded a total of 45,287 images and 1611 videos between August 8, 2011, and March 20, 2012. The police measure child pornography on a scale, with level five being the worst. Schnull had nearly 200 images in the level 5 category. Schnull was arrested during a joint state and federal police operation aimed at smashing a child pornography ring operating on Australia's eastern seaboard. He was one of 16 men arrested after police raided 19 properties in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT. But defence barrister Sandy Robertson said Schnull had been acting alone and did not take part in any chat rooms on child pornography or share any files. Mr Robertson said Schnull sought psychological treatment after his arrest to try to understand his offending. He said Schnull claimed to have stumbled across the child pornography and was "caught in a web of depraved vile images". Schnull knew what he was doing was illegal but watching child porn helped to ease his boredom at home and the lack of intimacy with his wife. Judge Mark Gamble, who briefly adjourned the plea hearing after being asked by the prosecutor to view a sample of 40 images taken from Schnull's computer, said sexual stimulation must have played a role in Schnull's offending. Judge Gamble said Schnull had gone to a great deal of trouble to download the images, including securing his study so others could not get in. Mr Robertson said it was difficult for Schnull to explain but he had been attracted by the novelty of the images and was driven by curiosity. Downloading thousands of images became a compulsive habit. Mr Robertson conceded there must have been an element of sexual stimulation for Schnull otherwise he wouldn't have bothered. Since undergoing therapy in August last year, Schnull, who had had little empathy for the victims, was now ashamed and remorseful and realised his actions had helped feed the market for child pornography. A psychological report indicated Schnull did not fit the profile of a repeat sexual offender and was unlikely to reoffend. In his letter of apology read to the court, Schnull said he felt revulsion for what he had done and realised he needed help. Ms Holmes said Schnull, a father of four, should be jailed for at least 18 months and placed on the sexual offenders register for 15 years given the seriousness of the offending and nature and amount of material seized. Judge Gamble will sentence Schnull on February 13. http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/man-watched-child-porn-for-stress-relief-court-hears-20130129-2dif9.html "Child porn ring accused face court" (24-3-2012) A 21-year-old university student and another Melbourne man have faced the Melbourne Magistrates Court, accused of being part of a child pornography ring smashed by police in a massive operation spanning four states and territories.

Raped an 18 yr old woman on December 19, 2008. Sharifi Abducted and raped a 25 yr old woman, at Frankston on Christmas Eve, 2008. News (12-4-2012)- "Serial rapist's Afghan ethnicity no excuse, says judge"- A JUDGE has today rejected an Afghan refugee's claim that he raped an intoxicated and vulnerable teenager because of cultural differences. Esmatullah Sharifi, 30, was appearing in the County Court for the second time in less than three years on a charge of rape and Judge Mark Dean said his background as a traumatised Muslim refugee was no excuse. The judge said a psychologist told the court Sharifi, who came to Australia in 2001 on a temporary protection visa, had "an unclear concept of what constitutes consent in sexual relationships'' in Australia. But the judge said Sharifi's background and flight from the Taliban in Afghanistan could not excuse an extreme act of violence. "You well knew the victim was not consenting to the act of sexual penetration you performed,'' Judge Dean said. Sentencing Sharifi for the rape of the 18-year-old woman, Judge Dean said that he had driven from his home in Tullamarine to Frankston looking for a victim. The woman was alone, intoxicated and sitting on the footpath near the 21st Century nightclub after she had a disagreement with her friends. Sharifi sat down beside her, started talking to her and offered to drive her to a hotel in Mornington where her friends had gone. Judge Dean said Sharifi drove in a different direction and the victim became concerned and texted her friends but he took her phone and found a dark street where he stopped. As she cried and asked if he planned to kill her Sharifi put his hand around her neck and forced her to remove her clothes before raping her. "Your offending is of the utmost seriousness,'' Judge Dean said in his County Court sentence. "You preyed upon a young vulnerable stranger who was alone and intoxicated at night. Your brutal conduct must be denounced by this court.'' Sharifi pleaded guilty to one count of rape committed on December 19, 2008. Judge Dean said that in 2009 Sharifi was jailed for a minimum of seven years for the abduction and rape of a woman at Frankston on Christmas Eve, 2008, five days after the rape of the teenager. In that case he forced the 25-year-old into his car, punched her and raped her and the victim escaped by jumping from his moving car. A DNA sample taken after his conviction led to the charge he faced in court today. Judge Dean said that he had to sentence Sharifi by taking into account the sentence he is already serving and he set a new term of 14 years with a minimum term of 11 years. The effect of the sentence is that he will be eligible for parole in seven years and eight months. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/true-crime-scene/serial-rapists-afghan-ethnicity-no-excuse-says-judge/story-fnat7dhc-1226324707559 News (28-3-2012)- "Brutal acts of violence: refugee's suburban rape cruises"- An Afghan refugee would drive from his home in Tullamarine to nightclubs in Frankston late at night searching for drunk, vulnerable young woman to prey on, a court was told today.

Michael Peter Smart, 35, is now facing 162 charges relating to the alleged assault of a girl aged under 16, over a two year period. He was initially charged with six offences earlier this year. Yesterday in the Bendigo Magistrates Court, he was remanded to reappear in court next month. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-05-27/man-faces-156-extra-child-sex-charges/843184 News (8-3-2010)- A Bendigo man charged with serious child sex offences including making child pornography with a minor has failed in his bid to have his name suppressed. Michael Peter Smart, 34, was arrested last Thursday morning after police searched his East Bendigo home. He has since been charged with sexual penetration of a child under 16, making and producing child pornography, possessing child pornography, procuring a child to make child pornography and blackmail. Police allege the offences relate to the sexual assault of a young girl during the past five years. They say more charges are expected to be laid. We believe there are more victims out there who will come forward, a police spokesman said. In an out-of-court hearing before a bail justice on Thursday night, Smart, a former train conductor, was denied bail. He appeared via video-link in the Bendigo Magistrates Court yesterday morning. Smart was not required to enter a plea and no application for bail was made. During the brief hearing, defence lawyer Luke Docherty asked the court to grant a suppression order prohibiting the media from publishing his clients name and employment details. He said if made public it could bring undue stress and embarrassment to the victim as well as Smarts family. The prosecution opposed the suppression order. Leading Senior Constable Jeff Lavery said the public should be made aware of such court proceedings, particularly if there are other victims involved. Police may need the assistance of the media to track down further victims. The suppression order was not granted and Magistrate Richard Wright remanded Smart in custody. The 34-year-old is scheduled to return to court on May 26 for a committal mention hearing. Anyone with information on the case should contact Bendigo Police Station on 5448 1300, or Crime Stoppers in 1800 333 000.

"You behaved as a predator who saw an opportunity to attack a sleeping, vulnerable woman and waited for an opportunity to rape her," Judge Gullaci said. "Young, vulnerable women or anyone in the community should be able to travel on trains or public transport without fear that people like you are lurking, waiting for the opportunity to rape or sexually assault them." In a statement tendered to the court, the victim said the attack, on December 29, 2005, had made her scared to use public transport. Smith, of Williamstown, insisted on his innocence throughout his County Court trial and pleaded not guilty to one count of digital rape. He told a jury he had been leaning towards the woman because he did not have his glasses and was trying to adjust his mobile phone. But a jury found him guilty and yesterday Smith was sentenced to a maximum of five years in jail with a non-parole term of three. Smith has already served a year in custody and will be eligible for release in October 2009. Judge Gullaci said Smith, who has a conviction of committing an indecent act with a child under 16, posed a threat to the sexual safety of others and placed him on the registered sex offender list. He said Smith had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/train-rapist-behind-bars/story-e6frf7kx-1111114718496|/images/leon_graham_smith_2.jpg
MICHAEL JOHN SMITH (VIC- Ararat)|55 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 6-5-2012, in the Ballarat Magistrates Court, to an 18 month community corrections order - will remain on the Sex Offenders Register for life.|Michael John Smith-Pleaded guilty to 16 charges in Ballarat Magistrates Court, including committing an indecent act with a child under 16, and 7 counts of wilful and obscene exposure. Serial flasher free from jail after pleading guilty (7-5-2012) REGION - A serial flasher who masturbated in front of young children in a park and showed pornography to a six-year-old girl in Ararat has been released from prison. Having already served 210 days in custody, Michael John Smith, 55, was yesterday sentenced to an 18 month community corrections order with no additional jail time. He was also ordered to undertake a sex offenders program, and will remain on the Sex Offenders Register for life. Smith pleaded guilty to 16 charges in Ballarat Magistrates Court, including committing an indecent act with a child under 16 and seven counts of wilful and obscene exposure. Among the string of offences, on November 9 last year Smith approached a mother and young children in the Smythesdale Gardens and masturbated in their direction. He then went to a bus shelter on the Glenelg Highway, where he again exposed himself and masturbated, this time while facing passing traffic. Smith then returned to the gardens where he exposed himself to another mother, who was with three children under the age of four. After the woman told him to get dressed, Smith went away and returned completely naked and masturbating about five metres away from them. Later that day police intercepted Smith on the Glenelg Highway. When they searched his car they found several sex toys, condoms, lubricant, pornographic DVDs and a length of rope. During the police interview Smith admitted several other recent flashing incidents including at the McDonalds drive-through in Sturt Street, and at McDonalds and Blockbuster Video in Sebastopol. Crown Prosecutor Alex Patton also said that on an earlier occasion when Smith was staying at the Ararat Hotel, he sat down with a six-year-old girl and played her a pornographic movie on his portable DVD player. Following a delay in a Corrections assessment, defence lawyer Patrick Bourke urged the court to release his client, saying he had already spent more time in custody than he was likely to be sentenced too. It just ought to have been done, its a simple as that, Mr Bourke said. Magistrate Richard Pithouse said he too was frustrated by the delay Smith had endured. http://www.araratadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/serial-flasher-free-from-jail-after-pleading-guilty/2583648.aspx

CRAIG STANLEY (VIC- Langwarrin)|28 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 4-7-2012, in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court, to 20 months jail - 10 months non-parole.|Craig Stanley..A raid on his Langwarrin home in outer Melbourne uncovered more than 17,000 child porn images.. Pleaded guilty to possessing child porn images, to making child porn images and transmitting 3 images.. Co-offender Rebecca Michels. Fugitive couple sentenced after pleading guilty to child porn- (4-7-2012) A FUGITIVE couple who spent 21 days on the run after police raided their home last year have been sentenced after pleading guilty to child pornography charges. Craig Stanley, 28, and Rebecca Michels, 25, were arrested in Dimboola in November after a three-week police hunt for the pair. The couple fled after a police raid of their home sparked by a tip off from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. At the Melbourne Magistrates' Court today Stanley was sentenced to 20 months in prison with a non-parole period of 10 months. Michels was placed on an 18-month community corrections order. It was alleged in court more than 80,000 pornographic images were uncovered during the raids. Of them more than 17,000 images and 531 videos depicting child pornography, including children as young as one-year-old, were found. Prosecutor Anne Hassan told the court some images showed Michels posing naked and semi-naked with a 10-year-old girl. The court heard Michels appeared naked alongside the girl in 10 images. Ms Hassan said it was believed the girl was as young as seven when the first naked photos of her were taken in 2009. It was alleged the girl's father and stepmother were also naked in some of the 279 images that were taken over a two-year period and showed close-up shots of the girl's genitals. The court heard the couples were nudists who met at a public pool. As a result of police inquiries the other couple are also facing charges. Michels, who is on bail, pleaded guilty to one count of making child porn. Her parents walked out of court as details of the charges were read out. Stanley, who is in custody, pleaded guilty to three charges including making, possessing and transmitting child porn. Other charges against the pair were dropped. Ms Hassan said the young girl told police Stanley and Michels were her "aunty and uncle'' and that her dad "doesn't do anything to hurt me''. She said the girl, who appeared "distressed'' during a police interview, was a "deeply exploitive child''. The court heard the girl was involved in a series of photo "sessions'' with one allegedly lasting up to five hours. Images depicting the girl were all deemed to be in a low category of child pornography, the court heard. But some images downloaded by Stanley included sadism and bestiality, it was alleged. Jim Dounias, for Stanley, said his client had been "immersed in pornography'' since the age of 13. "We don't blame Ms Michels for anything, we take full responsibility for everything,'' he said. Mr Dounias said while more than 17,000 images of child pornography were allegedly found on Stanley's computer, he had not viewed all the content. But Magistrate Jack Vandersteen questioned why it had been downloaded at all. "How do you download stuff and not look at it and not know what you're doing?'' he said. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/fugitive-couple-sentenced-after-pleading-guilty-to-child-porn/story-e6frea6u-1226416791640 Fugitive couple Craig Stanley and Rebecca Michels admit making child pornography..4-7-2012 A FORMER soldier who went on the run after police found thousands of depraved child porn images at his Melbourne home, including one of a baby being sexually abused, has pleaded guilty. Craig Stanley, 28, fled in October with his partner Rebecca Michels, 25, after a raid on their Langwarrin home in outer Melbourne led to the discovery of more than 17,000 child porn images. Police also found 279 images that Stanley had made involving a girl the couple met through being nudists, the Melbourne Magistrates Court was told on Wednesday. Michels has admitted making 10 images involving the same girl. Stanley has pleaded guilty to possessing 17,381 child porn images, to making child porn images and transmitting three images. Michels has admitted making child porn. Defence lawyer Jim Dounias said Stanley, a former soldier, was a nudist who had crossed the line and taken indecent photos of a girl. Magistrate Jack Vandersteen said there must have been an element of trust that was built up in the child before she participated in the photos. Mr Dounias said Stanley would be a registered sexual offender for life which would limit his work opportunities. Prosecutor Anne Hassan said the fact the identities of the children in the 17,381 images Stanley possessed were not known did not mean they were not victims. "These are real victims, real children," she said. Ms Hassan told the court among the 17,381 images found on electronic devices belonging to Stanley was one of a one-year-old baby being sexually abused. Michels will be assessed for a community corrections order, the court heard. Michels and Stanley fled to a remote bush campsite in Victoria, surviving on carp and baked beans and avoiding capture for 21 days until Michels tipped police off, a court previously heard. They were arrested in the Dimboola area in north-western Victoria. They are expected to be sentenced later on Wednesday. http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/fugitive-couple-craig-stanley-and-rebecca-michels-admit-making-child-pornography/story-fncz7kyc-1226416954434|/images/craig_stanley_2.jpg
DENNIS MICHAEL STEWART (VIC- Ballarat)|50 yrs old (2012)|To be updated.|Dennis Michael Stewart- FORMER teacher at a Ballarat secondary school- pleaded guilty to 4 counts of committing an indecent act with a child under 16, in the County Court in Ballarat 20-11-2012..Victims were 2 boys. News (21-11-2012)- "Former Ballarat teacher faces court again on sex charges" A FORMER teacher at a Ballarat secondary school has pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse charges. Dennis Michael Stewart, 50, appeared in the dock of the County Court in Ballarat yesterday, where he entered guilty pleas to four counts of committing an indecent act with a child under 16. In a courtroom void of friends or family, Stewart wept as the charges were read to him. The charges relate to two boys who were students at the school where Stewart taught. Three of the charges relate to one boy, and one to the other. The school cannot be named for legal reasons. Stewarts guilty plea spares 25 prosecution witnesses from giving evidence, including his two victims and 17 other civilians. Counsel for Stewart, Ian Hayden said his client would engage with a forensic psychiatrist before the plea hearing, which is scheduled for February 4 at the County Court in Melbourne. A video link will be set up with the Ballarat court to enable interested parties to watch the proceedings. Crown prosecutor Diana Piekusis said the matter was of some complexity and the plea hearing would likely require more than a day of court time. She said it was possible the Crown would cross- examine any medical witnesses put forward by the defence. Judge Richard Maidment extended Stewarts bail, but warned him he was facing a likely jail sentence. This is not an indication at all that should cause your client any optimism, Judge Maidment said about Stewarts bail. Since his initial arrest and release from custody, Stewart was returned to prison for breaching bail conditions by contacting students at the school where he previously taught. Then in April he was granted bail for a second time. http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/1135044/former-ballarat-teacher-faces-court-again-on-sex-charges/?cs=62|/images/dennis_michael_stewart_2.jpg
PHILLIP TAUPIN (Phillip Taupin) (VIC - North Melbourne)|33 yrs old (2013)|Sentence to be update..Pleaded guilty 22-7-2013, to 9 charges of indecent assault, making threats to inflict serious injury, rape, recklessly causing serious injury and common law assault - Case returns to court August 15, 2013.|Phillip Taupin - Rapist - Pleaded guilty to 9 charges of indecent assault, making threats to inflict serious injury, rape, recklessly causing serious injury and common law assault. "Rape victim tells court: I felt like a hunted animal" - (22-7-2013) A woman has told a court she "felt like an animal being hunted" after she was savagely raped on a bike path in Melbourne's north. Phillip Taupin, 33, pleaded guilty today to nine charges of indecent assault, making threats to inflict serious injury, rape, recklessly causing serious injury and common law assault. The County Court heard he would circle many of his victims - some as young as 15 - on his dirt bike on bike paths, preying on them before attacking the females. His first victim was walking in Lalor after finishing work late at night and he followed her from the train station. With a hood covering Taupin's face, he put a pair of scissors at her throat and said, "Don't say a word" as they began to wrestle and fell to the ground. The victim used all her wavering strength to fight off her attacker before being raped. In her victim impact statement read to court, the woman said she now felt self blame, worthlessness, guilt and had considered ending her life. "At the time I felt like an animal being hunted," she said. "I was savagely attacked, violated, poked and probed like an object that was used abused and thrown away like I was nothing. "My confidence of safety in the world has been significantly impacted. "Reliving and recalling all the details of the night where pieces of me were shattered and left scattered burden my spirit." The court was told that in December last year Taupin attacked a woman after she finished exercising on an oval in Mill Park. She was able to break free after hitting him in the testicles. In another eight attacks Taupin would ride his dirt bike around his victims on bike paths in Lalor, Thomastown, Reservoir, Fawkner and Coburg. He slapped some on the buttocks, grabbed one victim from behind and grabbed the thigh of a 15-year-old girl and then slapped the buttocks of her friend as the pair walked back from a milk bar. Taupin remains in custody and returns to court on August 15, when his plea hearing continues. http://www.news.com.au/national-news/victoria/rape-victim-tells-court-i-felt-like-a-hunted-animal/story-fnii5sms-1226683177141
BRENDON JAMES THOMAS (VIC- Red Cliffs)|yrs old|Sentenced in May 2011, in the County Court to 3 yrs and 9 months jail - 15 months non-parole.. Sentenced in June 2011 in the Mildura Magistrates Court, to a further 10 months imprisonment, to be served concurrently, for possessing child pornography.|Brendan Thomas - pleaded guilty to 10 charges of being involved in an indecent act with a child under the age of 16. Pleaded guilty to possessing of child pornography News (17-6-2011)- "Paedophile spared: No extra jail time for 161 child pornography images"- A RED Cliffs man already serving prison time for child sex offences has been spared further time behind bars despite pleading guilty to possession of child pornography in the Mildura Magistrates Court. Brendon James Thomas downloaded more than 150 images of child pornography in a three-week period in 2009 and also secretly filmed a nine-year-old girl while she dried her naked body with a towel. Thomas had earlier pleaded guilty in a County Court hearing to 10 charges of being involved in an indecent act with a child under the age of 16 and was last month sentenced to three years and nine months in prison with a minimum term before parole of 15 months. This week he was sentenced to a further 10 months imprisonment, to be served concurrently with the earlier sentence; his release date will remain in August next year. The court was this week told the child pornography allegations were initially linked with the sex offence charges but subsequently became separated as a matter of legal process. Police prosecutor Senior Constable Tansley Hill said police raided Thomas Red Cliffs house in April last year and seized computer equipment containing 161 images of child pornography. Sen-Constable Hill said the images included mostly category one images but also category four  the worst there is. The prosecutor said the images were downloaded by Thomas between May 24 and June 16, 2009 and copied two months later to a disc which has never been recovered. Sen-Constable Hill said Thomas refused to be interviewed by police about secretly filming a nine-year-old girl drying herself with a towel. Defence counsel Florian Andrighetto said the pornography charges came to light with other matters for which he had already been sentenced. In seeking a custodial term to be served concurrently with his existing penalty, Mr Andrighetto said his client was undertaking an accounting course while in prison and would have a job to go to when released. However, Sen-Constable Hill said that while there was no prosecution objection to concurrency, the very serious matters warranted a clear message that offences of that nature against innocent and defenceless children would not be tolerated. http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/paedophile-spared-no-extra-jail-time-for-161-child-pornography-images/2198007.aspx
GEOFFREY NORMAN THOMAS (VIC- Wodonga)|46 yrs old (2011)|Sentenced 23-9-2011 ,to 14 months jail - 8 months non-parole.|Geoffrey Thomas - pleaded guilty to an indecent act with a child under 16, and possessing child pornography. Victim was an 8 yr old girl. News (24-9-2011)- "Prison for paedophile"- A WODONGA man who indecently touched an eight-year-old girl and had 750 pornographic images on his laptop computer was yesterday jailed for eight months. Judge Marilyn Harbison said when sentencing Geoffrey Norman Thomas, 46, that his offending has had a profound impact on the victim and her parents. Victim impact statements had been tendered from them expressing their feelings over what happened. Thomas, a part-time spray painter, was described by Judge Harbison as an alcoholic who was drunk when the offences were committed. A forfeiture order was made relating to Thomas computer which had the images. Judge Harbison imposed an overall sentence of 14 months with a non-parole period of eight months. She said without a guilty plea Thomas would have received a 30-month jail term and 18 months to serve. He appeared for sentence after last month pleading guilty to an indecent act with a child under 16 and possessing child pornography. Judge Harbison had previously been told Thomas became friends with a North East family in 2007 regularly visiting their farm and playing with their children. One of the children, a girl, 8, said Thomas touched her inappropriately three times between January 1 and May 1, 2009. The first time Thomas took the girl behind a shed and when she was seated on his lap, he lifted her skirt and had touched her genitals before the girl tried to pull away and ran off. In the second incident, Thomas touched the girl through her underwear and only stopped when her father had come out of the house to find her. The father was told by his daughter on January 6 last year about the incidents and reported them to police the following day. When interviewed by police on January 8, Thomas said he had been tickling the girl. Her skirt rode up, her underwear was partly down and for some stupid reason I touched her vagina. Police found his laptop contained many child pornography images. Thomas told police that he had been visiting pornographic websites for a year. He had saved images but believed that there were few of children under 10. http://www.bordermail.com.au/news/local/news/general/prison-for-paedophile/2302611.aspx

TOVIA TOVIA (VIC - New Zealander born in Samoa)|27 yrs old (2012)|Sentenced 31-10-2011, in the Vic County Court, to 14 yrs jail - 8.5 yrs non parole.|Tovia Tovia/ Repeat Offender..pleaded guilty to 3 counts of rape, 1 of attempted rape and 1 of aggravated burglary..Tovia raped a 22 yr old woman at knifepoint after breaking into her Melbourne northwestern suburb home..Was on parole for another sex attack at the time. Rapist tried dating victims- (1-11-2011) A DELUDED sex fiend who tried to persuade victims to go on dates after he raped and sexually abused them was warned yesterday he risked spending a large part of his life in jail. Judge Gabriele Cannon told Tovia Tovia that a psychologist found he had "an elevated risk of re-offending" and the judge believed his chances of rehabilitation to be "bleak". She jailed him in the County Court for 14 years and set a minimum term of 8 1/2 years. Judge Cannon said that Tovia was on parole for another sex attack when he broke into the home of a 22-year-old woman in Melbourne's northwestern suburbs and subjected her to an ordeal that lasted several hours. Despite her tears and pleading Tovia raped the terrified stranger three times at knifepoint, while her 15-year-old sister slept in a nearby room. As she begged him to stop Judge Cannon said Tovia told her she could have his baby and added "It's not like I'm hurting you or anything". After the ordeal was over he asked the victim for her phone number, invited her to a party and a family dinner, left voicemail messages including one that asked if she would let him in if he returned. Judge Cannon said Tovia was deluded and his conduct was "chilling, disturbing and repugnant" and had a devastating effect on the woman who had to give up her job and risked having her car repossessed. Tovia, 26, a New Zealander born in Samoa, pleaded guilty to three counts of rape, one of attempted rape and one of aggravated burglary committed after he broke in to the victim's house through a bathroom window in November 2010. Judge Cannon said at the time Tovia was on parole, having served 18 months of a 39-month term for aggravated burglary and two counts of indecent assault. In that attack in June 2007 Tovia entered the unlocked back door of a woman's house and sexually assaulted her at knifepoint while her three-year-old son slept next door. The next day Tovia returned to her house hoping to persuade the woman to go on a date with him and he was arrested. Judge Cannon said Tovia had a serious drinking problem but her focus had to be on protecting the community rather than his rehabilitation. Tovia, who has been classified as a lifelong serious sexual offender, has to serve the unexpired portion of his sentence for the attack on his first victim before the latest sentence commences. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/rapist-tried-dating-victims/story-fn6bfm6w-1226181850857

Was a member of internet paedophile ring. had more than 16,000 sexually explicit pictures and pornographic videos of young children on his computer when it was seized by police. Pedophile jail terms 'too light' (1-6-2009) AUSTRALIA'S child pornography laws have been shown to be lenient, with US members of an internet pedophile ring jailed for life while its Townsville-based co-founder launches an appeal against his non-parole sentence of 32 months. Former Australia Post human resources regional manager Derek Richard Mara, 30, will next month fight to have his commonwealth jail term cut after he was convicted as one of the four founding members of the internet's oldest known pedophile ring, The Group, which financed made-to-order abuse movies and picture shoots of children, some just a few months old. Mara - who carried the moniker of "Tech" - provided computer expertise to encrypt and hide hundreds of thousands of files of the material sold and shared around the world. An investigation led by Queensland's Taskforce Argos and involving Interpol and the FBI infiltrated the ring in 2006, and last year arrested 22 core members and identified another 2500 customers of child-sex websites in 20 countries. More than 40 children identified in the images were rescued from abuse during the investigation. In recent months, The Australian has found that most of the 12 Americans convicted for their involvement in The Group have been sentenced to more than 30 years in jail for offences similar to those that Mara pleaded guilty to last year. Five Americans were given life, and another was sentenced to 70 years after he was also convicted of abusing a child and recording it on film. Other members of The Group, convicted in Europe, have received sentences of up to life in prison. Mara - who was also charged with indecent treatment of a child - was sentenced to six years in jail, with a non-parole period of 32 months after pleading guilty to three counts of sending and receiving pedophile images. It is believed to be the longest sentence given under commonwealth law for the offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years for producing, possessing or supplying child pornography. Child welfare expert Chris Goddard, who heads Monash University's Child Abuse Prevention Research Australia, said the states and commonwealth were lenient on those who traded in pedophile material. "Child abuse sentencing in Australia is soft in comparison with the rest of the world," Professor Goddard said. "The sentencing does not reflect the seriousness of the crime or the damage done. "One of the problems is the language - we call it child pornography, which gives a sense of consent. But these offenders are hiring people to grossly exploit and commit criminal acts against children. "We need to review the inadequate sentencing provisions." One other Australian, former Victorian schoolteacher Ian Wayne Tucker, 51, who was convicted as a member of The Group, was sentenced to 15months in jail. He had more than 16,000 sexually explicit pictures and pornographic videos of young children on his computer when it was seized by police.

MATTHEW JAMES VERNON (Matthew Vernon) (VIC- Ballarat East)|35 yrs old - 2013|Sentenced 1-11-2007,in the County Court in Ballarat,to 6.5 yrs jail - 5 yrs non parole.|Matthew James Vernon - Pleaded guilty in 2007, in the Ballarat County Court, to four counts of sexual penetration of a girl under 16.. Victim was an 11 yr old girl. The mother of a girl who gave birth at 12 after being raped by her babysitter has warned other parents to beware of predators posing as friends. The woman told how her daughter was barely coping with the "emotional tragedy". And she issued a chilling warning to all parents to be wary of anyone taking a special interest in their children. "Rape victim's mum warns of friends" (30-9-2007) -below. "Prison for babysitter" (2-11-2007) A Ballarat man who got an 11-year-old he was babysitting pregnant was yesterday jailed for a minimum of five years. Matthew James Vernon, 29, had sex with the girl on two occasions while baby-sitting at the family home, the County Court in Ballarat heard. The girl's teachers and mother noticed a change to her body shape and she gave birth at just 12 years of age. Outside court the girl's mother said the family now had to look towards the future."I'm just so glad that it's all over now, that we can get on with our lives and put an end to that horrific situation," she said. "Nobody else is going to get hurt by him."The woman described finding out her daughter was pregnant as a "bombshell".She said the family would always support the girl and give her the opportunity to be a teenager. Her daughter now aged 14 said she thought Vernon should have received a longer sentence. "It's changed my life totally," she said. "It's been really stressful but I've got though it."The girl said she would now be able to walk down the streets without feeling scared. "I'm glad that he's gone," she said. The girl's mother urged any children in similar circumstances to come forward and tell someone. Judge Margaret Rizkalla said Vernon had betrayed the trust of the girl's family who had incorporated the baby into their lives. "Her mother has taken on the mothering role," she said. "Their lives have been completely turned around."Judge Rizkalla said the girl was "torn between the world of being a mother and being a child of 14".She said Vernon was emotionally immature, had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had also been diagnosed with depression. The court heard Vernon was now in a stable relationship and had fathered another baby.Defence lawyer Helen Spowart said Vernon had become suicidal while in custody and feared for his safety from other prisoners. Vernon pleaded guilty to three counts of digital penetration and one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16. He was convicted and sentenced to six and a half years in jail with a minimum non parole period of five years. http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/597275/prison-for-babysitter/ "Rape victim's mum warns of friends" (30-9-2007) The mother of a girl who gave birth at 12 after being raped by her babysitter has warned other parents to beware of predators posing as friends. The woman told how her daughter was barely coping with the "emotional tragedy". And she issued a chilling warning to all parents to be wary of anyone taking a special interest in their children. Matthew James Vernon, 29, pleaded guilty in Ballarat County Court this month to four counts of sexual penetration of a girl under 16. Vernon, of Ballarat East, had sex with the girl at least twice while babysitting at her home. It was alleged he began the relationship with the girl when she was only 11 and even violated her while her mother was in the garden. The girl's pregnancy was confirmed with a home test after her mother and teachers had noticed changes in her body shape. She then named Vernon as the father and DNA tests confirmed his paternity. The girl's parents are now helping her to bring up the baby. But her mother said the girl was torn between wanting to be a mother and not losing her childhood. "She's bottling it up and then explodes," she said. The woman said that no parents could afford to be complacent over their children's welfare - even with so-called friends. "Just be wary of them," she said. "If they take a special interest in one person, particularly a girl, just be careful. "I don't want anyone else to go through the hell we've been through." Vernon will be sentenced at a date to be fixed. His defence counsel admitted that prison was the only appropriate punishment for him. http://m.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/dont-trust-your-mates/story-e6frf7kx-1111114532291 "Girl, 12, has babysitter's child" (20-9-2007) A 12-year-old schoolgirl gave birth to her babysitter's child, a court has heard. Matthew Vernon, 29, of Ballarat East, had sex with the girl at least twice while babysitting at her home. He was charged after the girl named him as the father following a home pregnancy test. Her mother and teachers had already noticed changes to her body shape. Vernon yesterday pleaded guilty at the County Court in Ballarat to four counts of sexual penetration of a child under 16 - a crime punishable by up to 15 years behind bars. Outside court, the girl's devastated mother expressed relief the legal process was drawing to an end. She said her daughter was barely coping with an "emotional tragedy", causing conflict within the family. "She's coping up to a point," the mother said. "She's not having counselling, which is very hard. She's bottling it up and then explodes; her anger comes out towards me." The woman said her daughter was also torn between wanting to be a mother and a child. "(The baby) calls me mum, which hurts (my daughter). I know in my own heart that (she) is her mother, but at the moment I have to let her be a kid and not take all the role, but some of that role," she said. The woman issued a warning to fellow parents who noticed family or friends acting strangely around children. "Just be wary of them. If they take a special interest in one person, particularly a girl, just be careful. Don't let anybody else go through the hell we've been through," she said. Crown prosecutor David Cordy said Vernon's offending had serious ongoing consequences for the victim, her family and her child. Vernon's defence counsel, Helen Spowart, conceded prison was the only appropriate punishment for his crimes. But Ms Spowart urged the court to set a relatively short non-parole period, saying Vernon had taken significant steps towards rehabilitation. She said her client had voluntarily sought counselling with clinical psychologist Dr Paul Grech, who assessed him as a low risk of re-offending. According to Dr Grech's report, Vernon had a history of personal immaturity, impulsiveness, and lack of social judgement. But he was not predatory or preoccupied with underage sexuality, Ms Spowart said. Ms Spowart asked the court to consider Vernon had no contact with his victim and felt shame and remorse for his behaviour. He had since entered a stable relationship, fathered another child and "grown up a lot", Ms Spowart said. "The relationship has given his life some focus, meaning and stability," she said. Judge Margaret Rizkalla revoked Vernon's bail and adjourned sentencing to a date to be fixed. http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/girl-12-has-babysitters-child/2007/09/20/1189881664247.html   Name: LUIGI VIVONA  (VIC- Sunshine)|38 yrs old| Sentenced in Nov 2004 in a VIC Court to 10 yrs jail.

ANTHONY DOUGLAS WALTERS (VIC)|yrs old|To be updated.|Pedophile. Convicted of several child sex offences. News (7-10-2009)- "Paedophile Anthony Douglas Walter wins $93,000 compensation for prison assault"- A PAEDOPHILE has won more than $93,000 compensation to pay for plastic surgery, psychological counselling and legal bills after suffering injuries from an assault in prison. Anthony Walters, convicted of several child sex offences, sued the State Government for pain and suffering, medical expenses and continuing counselling after being attacked. The Herald Sun has been prevented from detailing the nature of the injuries suffered by Walters, how they were inflicted or the reasons he believes he should be compensated by taxpayers. But Walters defended his right to a payout and broke his silence about aspects of his case when contacted by the Herald Sun. "I deserve the compensation," Walters said, indicating a scar on his face from the prison assault. "That type of thing should not happen in prison." He was most concerned his estranged wife may find out about his compo payday: "I don't want her finding out because she's going to go me for it. You would make me a target for my wife." The clerk, who works in Dandenong, said he had not told his employer of his criminal conviction. "I'm trying to start afresh. It would be extremely detrimental to my life if this became public," he said. The case is believed to be just the third payout of its type where victims are told of compensation payments to prisoners and given the chance to launch their own lawsuits against offenders while part of the cash remains quarantined in Department of Justice coffers for 12 months. In Walters' case, which finished in the County Court before Judge Philip Misso on August 24, $38,500 has been frozen in the Prisoner Compensation Quarantine Fund. It will be paid to him after a year if there is no legal action by any victims or creditors in relation to his criminal acts. The paedophile has already been given $11,500 for plastic surgery, including $7500 for medical costs and $4000 for "future psychological counselling". On top of the total $65,000 in damages, the court also ordered that $28,750 be handed to Walters for payment to his lawyers and the cost of lodging his civil damages claim. Affidavits and exhibits attached to the court file have been sealed and only the final orders and financial amounts awarded can be reported. The payout is enough to feed 11 average Melbourne families for a year. Walters said he had been moved by Corrections Victoria and his location was a secret. Police and Corrections Minister Bob Cameron said the Government had introduced new laws to make sure victims had access to part of compensation payments to criminals. Spokesman Cam Scott said the 2008 laws made sure money the criminal would otherwise have received are reserved in a trust fund so victims have first option on them. "Our Government believes it's fairer for victims to be able to access these funds instead of money going straight to the criminal." Opposition legal spokesman Robert Clark said it "beggars belief" that taxpayers would pay any money for cosmetic surgery while victims bear psychological scars for life. "The Brumby Government must explain to taxpayers why they have to pick up the tab for a paedophile's plastic surgery when the Government can't find the money for extra police to protect Victorian families or fund more hospital beds for sick children," Mr Clark said. "There is something wrong when the Brumby Government is funding plastic surgery for a paedophile while allowing child protection to collapse into crisis through its own incompetence and inaction." http://www.news.com.au/national/paedophile-anthony-douglas-walter-wins-93000-compensation-for-prison-assault/story-e6frfkvr-1225783571902

Predator cases all too familiar- (11-1-2012) IS ANY punishment sufficient for an adult who uses social media to prey on innocent and impressionable young girls? This is a real-life issue that continues to plague communities across Australia. A computer or mobile phone are the weapons of choice for those who prey on these young girls. The reach of such weapons allows predators to groom potential victims anytime and anywhere. Take Frankston band manager John Zimmerman who used these social media devices to coerce young girls into sexually explicit conversations, getting naked on web cameras and sex. Investigators found 55 of Zimmermans victims aged between 12 and 17 across four Australian states. Disturbingly, they predicted the media attention surrounding the case would bring more victims forward. Thankfully, Zimmerman was caught and his predator lifestyle will see him spend the next 16 years in jail. The Wimmera city of Horsham experienced its own predator in 2008. Mark Weaver pleaded guilty to 27 charges relating to child pornography, indecent assault and having sex with a child under 16. Weaver preyed on his victim through an internet chatroom. He then showered the girl with 8492 phone calls and text messages between November 2006 and April 2007. In all, the pair exchanged 12,939 texts and phone calls in that period. Their relationship stopped when the girls mother became aware of the messages and called police. These are just two of many cases that have surfaced with the popularity of social media technology. Sadly, there are many other such stories in many communities. How many more predators are out there working on their next victim? Much good work is being done by police units to catch these predators and by support agencies to educate young people about the dangers posed by social media. But as the Mark Weaver case proved, ultimately its wary parents who can play the biggest role in stopping them. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/73705/predator-cases-all-too-familiar/ Jail for child-porn photographer- (21-4-2010) A man from western Victoria who seduced a 14-year-old girl and took pornographic photographs of eight other teenage girls was today jailed for six and a half years. Mark Wayne Weaver, 47, of Horsham, was sentenced in the County Court after pleading guilty last year to 24 charges, including indecent assault, creating child pornography, procuring a child for making pornography and sexual penetration of a child under 16. The court heard Weaver told his teenage victims, aged from 14 to 18, he would find them modelling work if they posed for him, and then molested the girls during photographic sessions. Judge Barbara Cotterell said Weaver, an electrician, took photos of the girls in erotically suggestive poses and in some cases forcibly undressed them, touching them without consent in the process. In one case, Weaver initiated contact with a 14-year-old girl over the internet and maintained contact via a mobile phone, with more than 12,000 calls and messages recorded between the pair from November 2006 to April 2007. Judge Cotterell said Weaver's seduction of a 14-year-old girl was "abhorrent" and the community "will not accept the procuring of children for pornographic purposes". The court heard Weaver met his victims while they were working in local supermarkets and services stations. With a campaign of flattery and promises of money, Weaver convinced the girls to pose on cars and motorbikes in clothes and bikinis he provided. She said all of Weaver's victims would be subjected to "psychological suffering" as a result of his predatory activities and characterised his offending as "very serious". Weaver was sentenced to a non-parole period of four years. http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/jail-for-childporn-photographer-20100421-sujz.html#ixzz24tw32HLG http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/man-jailed-for-sex-crimes-against-models-20100421-sxgz.html|/images/mark_weaver_3.jpg

News (5-9-2012)- "Tougher rape sentences push by former DPP Jeremy Rapke push fails in Supreme Court" A Court appeal by a former Victorian DPP to push for tougher sentences for rapists has been rejected by the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal today dismissed an appeal by former DPP Jeremy Rapke, QC, against the sentence of a man who raped a 17-year-old in 2008. Mr Rapke had hoped to use the case against Jason Werry to toughen up sentences for rapists he said at the time were too lenient. Werry, then 28, raped his 17-year-old victim after she refused an offer of $500 to have sex with him. The woman had been drinking and was crying when Werry pulled over and talked to her in October 2008. He asked her if she was a "working girl'' and offered her $500 to have sex with him. Werry later took her to a park, pushed her into a bushy area and raped her. The court heard the girl pleaded with Werry to stop the assault but was told to stop crying, it would soon be over. Werry, who pleaded not guilty, was jailed for seven years and one month with a minimum of five years _ despite rape carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years. A spokesman for Mr Rapke said at the time the case showed why Victoria's Court of Appeal "needs to provide guidance as to the yardstick ranges for the crime of rape". It was argued given the gravity of the offence and Werry's not-guilty plea, the sentence gave inadequate weight to the available maximum and too much weight to current sentencing practices. But a Court of Appeal judgement today dismissed Mr Rapkes appeal. There was so little prospect of the Courts being persuaded that a different sentence should have been imposed, less still of the sentence being shown to be wholly outside the range, that the appeal should not have been brought in the first place, it said. The judgment found Mr Rapke did not press the court to increase (Werrys) sentence but had used the case to challenge Current Sentencing Practices (CSP). Putting to one side the Directors contention that CSP for rape require significant adjustment, there was nothing at all untoward, or unusual, about this sentence. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/tougher-rape-sentences-push-by-former-dpp-jeremy-rapke-push-fails-in-supreme-court/story-fnat7dhc-1226465538507

Yildirim was working as a security guard at Coles in Knox City in Melbourne's east when the offence occurred. Has an electronics degree he earned in Turkey. http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/security-guard-jailed-for-sex-assault-20101217-190f8.html News (14-12-2010)- A COLES security guard who pressured a young shoplifter into having sex with him said it was the most shameful act he had ever committed on another person, the County Court has heard. Turkish national Onur Yildirim, 26, has pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual penetration of a 16-year-old child who was under his care, supervision and authority. The court was told that on July 11, Yildirim was working at Coles in Knox City in Melbourne's east when he saw the girl take a bottle of body spray from the store without paying. He took her to the manager's office and told her that if he reported her to police it could ruin her life, but if she offered him sex he would not report her. The girl told the court in an impact statement that by agreeing to his demands "I got myself out of that situation but then I got myself into a worse one''. CCTV footage of the incident shows Yildirim leading the girl to a disabled toilet in the southeast shopping mall where they stayed for nine minutes while Yildirim penetrated her. His crime came to light on the same day when the girl told a friend in a phone conversation what had happened and which was overheard by the friend's mother who then encouraged the victim to go to the police. Yildirim's counsel Peter Chadwick, SC, said his client did not have a criminal past and had come to Australia looking for work with his electronics degree. He described Yildirim's action as a lapse of judgment which had "catapulted him from a law-abiding, upright, fine member of the community to a prisoner''. In his statement to the court, Yildirim said he was very remorseful and left work early that day because he realised the enormity of what he had done and how shameful he felt. Mr Chadwick said Yildirim had spent the past 151 days since he was arrested in protective custody in the Melbourne Remand Centre. Mr Chadwick said that if he was sentenced to more than one year's jail he risked being deported to Turkey and away from his current partner. Prosecutor Michelle Zammit said there had been a level of aggravated degradation involved with the girl forced to lie on the toilet floor and the sex carried out without a condom. She said the girl had told him three times during the sexual assault that she didn't want to go ahead with it but he continued. "That makes it more than just a lapse of concentration or a foolish slip,'' she said. She told Judge Christine Thornton that a suitable penalty for the crime was in the six to eight year range. The sentencing was adjourned to December 17. http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/coles-security-guard-who-pressured-young-shoplifter-into-sex-act-ashamed-of-his-actions-court-told/story-e6frf7jo-1225971020671

Andrew Jon Wadas, 38, has been in custody since his arrest at a beach near Swansea last December where he was hoping to meet an 11-year-old boy. Instead he met police who had been monitoring Wadass activity online for a month. They recorded sexually explicit conversations Wadas was having online including one boast that he had performed various sex acts with a 10-year-old boy in a shower. Wadas has previous convictions on his record for child sex offences. He will face Newcastle District Court next week where a sentence date will be set. http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/paedophile-pleads-guilty-to-grooming-11yearold/2532539.aspx

ANTHONY DOUGLAS WALTERS (VIC)|yrs old|To be updated.|Pedophile. Convicted of several child sex offences. "Paedophile Anthony Douglas Walter wins $93,000 compensation for prison assault"- (7-10-2009) A Paedophile has won more than $93,000 compensation to pay for plastic surgery, psychological counselling and legal bills after suffering injuries from an assault in prison. Anthony Walters, convicted of several child sex offences, sued the State Government for pain and suffering, medical expenses and continuing counselling after being attacked. The Herald Sun has been prevented from detailing the nature of the injuries suffered by Walters, how they were inflicted or the reasons he believes he should be compensated by taxpayers. But Walters defended his right to a payout and broke his silence about aspects of his case when contacted by the Herald Sun. "I deserve the compensation," Walters said, indicating a scar on his face from the prison assault. "That type of thing should not happen in prison." He was most concerned his estranged wife may find out about his compo payday: "I don't want her finding out because she's going to go me for it. You would make me a target for my wife." The clerk, who works in Dandenong, said he had not told his employer of his criminal conviction. "I'm trying to start afresh. It would be extremely detrimental to my life if this became public," he said. The case is believed to be just the third payout of its type where victims are told of compensation payments to prisoners and given the chance to launch their own lawsuits against offenders while part of the cash remains quarantined in Department of Justice coffers for 12 months. In Walters' case, which finished in the County Court before Judge Philip Misso on August 24, $38,500 has been frozen in the Prisoner Compensation Quarantine Fund. It will be paid to him after a year if there is no legal action by any victims or creditors in relation to his criminal acts. The paedophile has already been given $11,500 for plastic surgery, including $7500 for medical costs and $4000 for "future psychological counselling". On top of the total $65,000 in damages, the court also ordered that $28,750 be handed to Walters for payment to his lawyers and the cost of lodging his civil damages claim. Affidavits and exhibits attached to the court file have been sealed and only the final orders and financial amounts awarded can be reported. The payout is enough to feed 11 average Melbourne families for a year. Walters said he had been moved by Corrections Victoria and his location was a secret. Police and Corrections Minister Bob Cameron said the Government had introduced new laws to make sure victims had access to part of compensation payments to criminals. Spokesman Cam Scott said the 2008 laws made sure money the criminal would otherwise have received are reserved in a trust fund so victims have first option on them. "Our Government believes it's fairer for victims to be able to access these funds instead of money going straight to the criminal." Opposition legal spokesman Robert Clark said it "beggars belief" that taxpayers would pay any money for cosmetic surgery while victims bear psychological scars for life. "The Brumby Government must explain to taxpayers why they have to pick up the tab for a paedophile's plastic surgery when the Government can't find the money for extra police to protect Victorian families or fund more hospital beds for sick children," Mr Clark said. "There is something wrong when the Brumby Government is funding plastic surgery for a paedophile while allowing child protection to collapse into crisis through its own incompetence and inaction." http://www.news.com.au/national/paedophile-anthony-douglas-walter-wins-93000-compensation-for-prison-assault/story-e6frfkvr-1225783571902

"Computer porn earns $2500 fine" (20-10-2005) A Yeppoon man caught with more than 100 child pornography images was yesterday fined $2500. The images included children, some as young as five, engaged in sex acts, the Rockhampton Magistrates Court was told. Andrew Graham Watts, 35, pleaded guilty to possessing objectionable computer games. Police prosecutor Constable Calvin Gnech said police had found the images on an open lap- top computer during a search of Watts's Yeppoon residence. The computer was forwarded to an examination unit in Brisbane and a total of 11,000 pornographic images were found. "More than 100 depicted young children under 16,'' Constable Gnech said. Watts's solicitor, Alan Grant, said the computer had belonged to his client's brother. Watts had taken up an intro- ductory one-month internet con- nection trial, he said. Mr Grant said Watts suffered from bipolar disorder, which af- fected a person's judgment. "More importantly they (suffer- ers) don't think through the con- sequences of their actions,'' Mr Grant said. Magistrate Bronwyn Springer said the offence was serious as children were vulnerable people within the community and should not be violated, including by "consumers''.

"Predator cases all too familiar" (11-1-2012) Is any punishment sufficient for an adult who uses social media to prey on innocent and impressionable young girls? This is a real-life issue that continues to plague communities across Australia. A computer or mobile phone are the weapons of choice for those who prey on these young girls. The reach of such weapons allows predators to groom potential victims anytime and anywhere. Take Frankston band manager John Zimmerman who used these social media devices to coerce young girls into sexually explicit conversations, getting naked on web cameras and sex. Investigators found 55 of Zimmermans victims aged between 12 and 17 across four Australian states. Disturbingly, they predicted the media attention surrounding the case would bring more victims forward. Thankfully, Zimmerman was caught and his predator lifestyle will see him spend the next 16 years in jail. The Wimmera city of Horsham experienced its own predator in 2008. Mark Weaver pleaded guilty to 27 charges relating to child pornography, indecent assault and having sex with a child under 16. Weaver preyed on his victim through an internet chatroom. He then showered the girl with 8492 phone calls and text messages between November 2006 and April 2007. In all, the pair exchanged 12,939 texts and phone calls in that period. Their relationship stopped when the girls mother became aware of the messages and called police. These are just two of many cases that have surfaced with the popularity of social media technology. Sadly, there are many other such stories in many communities. How many more predators are out there working on their next victim? Much good work is being done by police units to catch these predators and by support agencies to educate young people about the dangers posed by social media. But as the Mark Weaver case proved, ultimately its wary parents who can play the biggest role in stopping them. http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/73705/predator-cases-all-too-familiar/ "Jail for child-porn photographer" (21-4-2010) A man from western Victoria who seduced a 14-year-old girl and took pornographic photographs of eight other teenage girls was today jailed for six and a half years. Mark Wayne Weaver, 47, of Horsham, was sentenced in the County Court after pleading guilty last year to 24 charges, including indecent assault, creating child pornography, procuring a child for making pornography and sexual penetration of a child under 16. The court heard Weaver told his teenage victims, aged from 14 to 18, he would find them modelling work if they posed for him, and then molested the girls during photographic sessions. Judge Barbara Cotterell said Weaver, an electrician, took photos of the girls in erotically suggestive poses and in some cases forcibly undressed them, touching them without consent in the process. In one case, Weaver initiated contact with a 14-year-old girl over the internet and maintained contact via a mobile phone, with more than 12,000 calls and messages recorded between the pair from November 2006 to April 2007. Judge Cotterell said Weaver's seduction of a 14-year-old girl was "abhorrent" and the community "will not accept the procuring of children for pornographic purposes". The court heard Weaver met his victims while they were working in local supermarkets and services stations. With a campaign of flattery and promises of money, Weaver convinced the girls to pose on cars and motorbikes in clothes and bikinis he provided. She said all of Weaver's victims would be subjected to "psychological suffering" as a result of his predatory activities and characterised his offending as "very serious". Weaver was sentenced to a non-parole period of four years. http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/jail-for-childporn-photographer-20100421-sujz.html#ixzz24tw32HLG http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/man-jailed-for-sex-crimes-against-models-20100421-sxgz.html "Horsham man pleads guilty to sex offences after exchanging 12,939 texts, phone calls with victim, 14" (19-11-2009) http://www.mailtimes.com.au/story/969523/horsham-man-pleads-guilty-to-sex-offences-after-exchanging-12939-texts-phone-calls-with-victim-14/ "8492 calls to teen lover" (1-11-2007) http://www.mailtimes.com.au/story/963088/8492-calls-to-teen-lover/|/images/mark_weaver_3.jpg

Man jailed for sexual assault- (15-6-2012) A VISIBLY shaken and nervous woman told Rockhampton District Court how in May last year, a man climbed onto her upstairs veranda, broke into her bedroom and sexually assaulted her. Yesterday John Weeding, after a two-day trial, was found guilty of unlawful and indecent assault and sentenced to 3 years in jail. He has already served 191 days. The woman, who can't be named, told the court on Wednesday that she had previously met Weeding on two occasions; once when they smoked marijuana after a night out with a mutual acquaintance, and again when he broke into her house demanding "cones". The complainant was the only witness and told the jury she froze when she saw Weeding, whom she knew as John Boy, break in through the sliding door into her bedroom. She claimed Weeding was carrying a knife and threatened that if she didn't shut up, he would kill her, though she conceded Weeding had scissors and not a knife. Weeding grabbed the woman, tearing her knickers before she escaped out the back door with Weeding chasing her. She was able to run back upstairs and lock the door behind her. Defence barrister Ross Lo Monaco told the jury that in the absence of eyewitnesses or any evidence of an independent nature, it was a case of word against word. He said her evidence contained grave inconsistencies and the case would come down to the jury's view of the complainant's credibility and reliability. Weeding's barrister, Josh Phillips, told the court that just because someone smoked marijuana, it didn't necessarily make them unreliable. The jury returned its verdict yesterday afternoon after deliberating for less than three hours. http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/story/2012/06/15/man-jailed-for-sexual-assault-on-woman-after-climb/

DARREN HARLEY WEST (WA - Aboriginal community at Warburton)|47 yrs old (2013)|Jailed indefinitely in WA, Feb - 2013.|Darren Harley West- Child Sex Offences-Repeat Offender. Judge jails WA sex offender indefinitely (23-1-2013) A court has ruled a convicted pedophile with a near 20-year history of sexually abusing teenagers remain in prison indefinitely because he still poses a serious risk to the community. Darren Harley West, 47, was first convicted of having sex with a girl aged under 16 in 1996. He was convicted of the same offence with another girl in 2006. After being found guilty of a similar offence against a 13-year-old boy in 2007, West was sent to prison for six years, with a release date of October 2012. Western Australia's Director of Public Prosecutions objected to West's release under the state's Dangerous Sexual Offenders Act, and on Wednesday Justice Michael Corboy agreed he still needed to be locked up after two psychiatrists ruled him a serious risk of reoffending. "In my view, the community can only be adequately protected, at this time, by a continuing detention," Justice Corboy said. West's family had supported his release to the Aboriginal community at Warburton. But Justice Corboy ruled West's history of offending and the likelihood he would be in close proximity to adolescents if he was released was too big a concern. "The reality is that in a small community, such as Warburton, Mr West would always be in close proximity to young adolescents," Justice Corboy said. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/judge-jails-wa-sex-offender-indefinitely/story-e6freuz0-1226560245254

MARK BRADLEY WIMBRIDGE (WA)|45 yrs old (2012)|Currently March 2011 is jailed indefinitely - detention to be reviewed annually.|Mark Bradley Wimbridge- Rapist/ Repeat Offender. News (17-3-2011)- "Chemical castration fails to cure rapist" A dangerous repeat rapist, who was released on supervision last year, has been sent back to jail after the Supreme Court was told he breached his release conditions, had psychopathic tendencies and that chemical castration had failed. Mark Bradley Wimbridge, 44, whose long criminal history includes a brutal sex attack on a woman when he was 18 and the repeated rape of a prostitute, was released last July with conditions that he have treatment and stay away from sex workers and areas of "erotic activity". At the time, Justice Peter Blaxell noted Wimbridge was taking part in a trial of an anti-libidinal drug and had taken responsibility for his offending. But yesterday, the same court was told that the drug, aimed at reducing the rapist's sex drive, was not working. His testosterone level had lowered, but there was no associated reduction in libido, the court was told. Wimbridge was in court because he breached the release conditions which banned him from drinking alcohol, entering the suburbs of Northbridge and Highgate and going to sex shops and places of "erotic activity". The court was told Wimbridge had been caught drink-driving twice, was found with an undisclosed Internet-capable mobile, had viewed hardcore pornography, was arranging to meet a prostitute, and had covertly filmed a woman at a bus stop. Psychiatrist Peter Wynn Owen told the court that, in his opinion, the chemical castration had failed and there were no practicable methods to supervise Wimbridge in the community. Dr Wynn Owen said it appeared Wimbridge had psychopathic tendencies and could not be trusted to honestly self-report to authorities as part of his release. Justice John McKechnie said Wimbridge's breaches were very serious and that he presented a risk to the community. Wimbridge was jailed indefinitely and his detention will now be reviewed annually. http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/wa/9023465/chemical-castration-fails-to-cure-rapist/ http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/7613896/judge-orders-rapist-s-release/

The court heard Yates had a sexual offending history that spanned almost 15 years and started with the repeated assault of an 8 yr old girl. "Previously convicted sex offender Papa K plied teenage girls with drugs before sexually assaulting them" (21-2-2014) A convicted sex grub known to a bevy of teenage girls as Papa K plied them with ice before sexually assaulting them. Kerry David Yates, 49, was jailed for more than six years today for the vile acts on children who returned sexual favours for cocktails of drugs. At times the socially isolated loner committed the disgusting acts while other children watched on. At the time of his offending he was already a convicted sex offender and ignored strict reporting conditions. He pleaded guilty dozens of offences including sexual penetration, drug and failing to comply with reporting obligations charges. Sentencing him to six years and three months imprisonment today County Court judge Frank Gucciardo said Yates offending had been reprehensible. He said he had shown no remorse, and failed to see how his offending on the vulnerable young girls was wrong. The court heard Yates had a sexual offending history that spanned almost 15 years and started with the repeated assault of an eight-year-old girl. The girl was abused her on a string of occasions at his Melbourne home between 2000 and 2001. Yates denied the offending but was found guilty by a jury last month of nine counts of sexual penetration of the girl and of acting indecently in her company. Judge Gucciardo said the offending against the young girl was repeated, brazen and sometimes in the presence of another young child. Sexual offences of this nature are repulsive to the community and the community rightly abhors them, he said. It took the young victim almost a decade to report the offending to police. In the meantime Yates was placed on a suspended sentence for assaulting another 13-year-old girl in similar circumstances, again with another child present. As part of his sentence he was placed on the sex offenders register and ordered to adhere to strict reporting conditions. Instead he lied to authorities about his contact with children and embarked on a drug-fuelled sex abuse rampage of young girls. Much of the offending took place in a garage at the back of Yates ex-wifes home, where he was living. They called him Papa K or Big Kerry and were aged between 14 and 16. Judge Gucciardo said he plied them with ice and cannabis in return for sexual favours. At least one of the girls had never used drugs but became addicted to ice after Yates encouraged her to try it. Medical experts found no evidence of mental illness or cognitive impairment. But Yates was found to have pedophilic tendencies and an attraction to young girls. Judge Gucciardo said Yates became more socially isolated as his drug use increased and had made a deliberate choice to target young girls. He imposed a non-parole period of four years and three months. .

News (10-2-2012)- "Man pleads guilty in Facebook sexual assault case " A MOUNT Direction man who seduced a 14-year-old girl via Facebook has pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault and having sex with a person under 17 years old. Reginald Robert Young, who turned 20 on Thursday, was remanded in custody after entering the plea in the Supreme Court in Launceston yesterday. The court heard Young sent the girl a ``poke'' on the social networking site in March last year. "She didn't know who he was but she poked him back,'' crown prosecutor Peter Sheriff said. ``A few days later she received a friend request.'' Mr Sheriff said the pair exchanged messages on Facebook and by SMS for several weeks and Young asked the girl to be his girlfriend. In May last year they met in the car park of Chickenfeed at George Town. On a second meeting they had sex in the back of Young's car in a beach car park, then performed other sexual acts in the women's cubicle of a public toilet block. Mr Sheriff said that the girl ended the relationship the next day but Young continued to send her text messages. Young also pleaded guilty yesterday to a separate count of aggravated sexual assault for digitally raping a 12-year-old girl in 2010, committing an indecent act directed at a young person, and child pornography charges. He knew the 12-year-old girl through a family friend and sent her a text message that said he loved her and wanted to be with her. "The complainant informed the accused that she was 12 years old and he was too old for her," Mr Sheriff said. He said that Young arranged to meet the girl, who was then in grade six, after school in Launceston on April 10, 2010. He said that Young lifted the girl up and carried her to a public toilet where he sexually assaulted her in one of the cubicles. "The complainant's friend then went into the adjacent cubicle and heard the complainant saying, `stop it, stop it'," Mr Sheriff said. Young's lawyer, Tamara Jago, said that he maintained the girl walked with him to the toilet block. He was arrested after police searched his family home at Mount Direction on June 14 last year. The search uncovered child exploitation images and videos, including 27 images and videos of the 14-year-old and two other teenage girls from the Launceston area. http://www.examiner.com.au/story/430436/man-pleads-guilty-in-facebook-sexual-assault-case/|/images/reginald_young_2.jpg
TONY WILLIAM YOUNG (Tony Young) (WA - Perth)|41 yrs old (2013)|Serving 14 yrs jail - Young will be eligible for parole in November 2023.|Tony William Young - Convicted sex offender. "WA sex offender jailed for extra 10 years over 2007 attack" (6-6-2013) A convicted sex offender has been sentenced to a further 10 years behind bars for a "sinister'' sexual assault on a mother during a home invasion. Tony William Young, 41, entered the woman's home in 2007 via an unlocked door, threatening her three-year-old daughter who was sleeping in a nearby room, and sexually assaulted the woman. Young wore a balaclava but his DNA was matched four years later when he attempted to rape a 16-year-old girl at Prevelly beach, in the state's south-west. For the 2007 matter, he was convicted after a District Court trial of aggravated burglary and committing sexual penetration without consent, aggravated sexual penetration without consent, attempted sexual penetration without consent and deprivation of liberty. In sentencing today, Judge Anette Schoombee said Young had told the woman he knew her and had watched her. "Your offending was therefore well-planned and pre-meditated,'' Judge Schoombee said. After a two-hour struggle and a conversation about their families, Young fled. "You told her that you felt sorry for her, placed the pillow back under her head and tucked the blankets in around her,'' Judge Schoombee said. She said the whole incident must have been ``truly horrifying and extremely frightening'' for the victim. "Apart from the fact that she was raped by a stranger, she would also not have known whether you indeed intended to kill her or harm her daughter or not,'' Judge Schoombee said. The judge noted the woman was seeing a psychiatrist, suffered paranoia and anxiety, was on medication and was bankrupt. "She started living like a prisoner in her own home, and had installed motion sensor lights and dead bolts to the doors,'' she said. Young was sentenced to 10 years in prison, to be served on top of his four-year prison term for the 2011 crime. Young, who is now in a wheelchair, will be eligible for parole in November 2023. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/wa-sex-offender-jailed-for-extra-10-years-over-2007-attack/story-fnhocxo3-1226658918093

MURRAY WILLIAM BRITZA (WA- Beverley)|63 yrs old (2010)|Sentenced in the Perth District Court, to two 12-month suspended jail terms- placed on 18-month good behaviour bond, and fined a total of $12,000.|Murray Britza - Child pornography offences. FORMER teacher at Beverley District High School, and WA pony club president. News (29-11-2010)- "Child porn offender teacher avoids jail"- A FORMER teacher and West Australian pony club president has avoided jail after being found guilty of viewing child pornography online. Murray William Britza, 63, of Beverley, 130km east of Perth, was sentenced today on five counts of accessing child porn websites between November 2008 and June 2009. In the District Court in Perth, Judge Philip McCann sentenced Britza to two 12-month terms of imprisonment, to be suspended immediately, and placed him on an 18-month good behaviour bond. On the three other counts he fined Britza a total of $12,000. The judge said the offending was not of the most serious kind and Britza had not downloaded or saved any of the material he viewed. But he criticised the former teacher for "living a lie in maintaining his innocence" and deluding himself in maintaining he was the victim of a "computer gremlin". WA's Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) gathered evidence against Britza by obtaining warrants to install hidden listening devices and a camera, then searching his house in July 2009, seizing a modem and computer. Judge McCann said some of the boys depicted engaging in sexual acts in the images found on the computer were under the age of 16 but in other cases it was hard to ascertain whether the youths were under-aged. He said Britza was of "impeccable character save for these offences" and the high reputation he had achieved in the community had been ruined by his offending. Until earlier this year, Britza was president of the Pony Club Association of Western Australia. Judge McCann said his ability to contribute to the community further, including his work with disabled riders, was now lost. He concluded that Britza had been stressed by degenerative medical conditions and had suffered an undiagnosed depressive illness that led him to act out of character and with poor judgment. Outside court, CCC investigations manager Trevor Wynn said the sentencing was a message to offenders that law enforcement agencies were determined to find them and bring them to the courts for viewing child pornography. "Each one of those images indicates a time when a child, a defenceless child was engaged in some activity of which they had no say about," he said. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/child-porn-offender-teacher-avoids-jail/story-e6frfku0-1225962922063#ixzz1v78Tz3qg http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/newshome/8155465/teacher-convicted-of-child-porn-charges/
SHIRLEY ANN VERONICA BULSEY (WA- Oombulgurri)|yrs old (2012)|Sentenced to 4 yrs and 9 months jail.|Shirley Bulsey - convicted 4 counts of child sex abuse. Hope at last for 'hell on earth'- (8-6-2010) IT was just days after the Howard government announced its controversial intervention in the Northern Territory when the man dubbed Oombulgurri's sheriff boasted his community was free of child sex abuse. Reading Darren (Darryl) John Morgan's comments in a local Perth newspaper in mid-2007, Kimberley detective Tom Doyle - who had been investigating shocking cases of child sex abuse across the north of Western Australia - was instantly suspicious. "Darryl Morgan was pictured holding a baby and saying, 'This is the only place without child sex abuse.' That's probably what sparked the investigation into Oombulgurri, I looked around and asked a few of the Aboriginal ladies in Kalumburu [900km northeast of Broome], 'Is it happening over there?' "Most of those women were from Oombulgurri originally and they said, 'That's exactly what's happening over there.' " Three years on, Morgan, the community's head warden, has been convicted of 21 counts of abuse against two girls as young as 12, and has been sentenced to 10 years in jail. His wife, Shirley Ann Veronica Bulsey, was convicted on four counts of child sex abuse, including two of preparing one of the girls for Morgan to have sex with. She has been sentenced to four years and nine months in jail. The charges against Morgan and Bulsey were among 109 laid against seven alleged offenders after Doyle and a team of sex crime detectives spent 18 months uncovering what they describe as the town's "deeply guarded secret". Doyle says everyone who had links to the town, including government workers, knew that child sex abuse had been going on for years but no one knew what to do. "It was hard to approach and deal with something that had been going on for so long," he says. Victims felt extreme shame and were too afraid to come forward because of the level of fear and intimidation exerted by some of the town's leaders. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/hope-at-last-for-hell-on-earth/story-e6frg6z6-1225876662037

Pleaded guilty to 20 counts of visually recording a private activity, and 11 counts of indecent acts in public. News (28-5-2012)- A MAN who took photos up the skirts of women in Perth shopping centres and in their own homes has avoided jail. Sebastiano Contarino, 57, pleaded guilty earlier this year to 20 counts of visually recording a private activity and 11 counts of indecent acts in public. Today in the Perth Magistrates Court, Contarino was placed on a 12-month intensive supervision order for the offences and must complete a yet-to-be-determined program as part of that order. The court was previously told Contarino, who has no prior criminal record, used a camera pen which he would place under the skirts of women without their knowledge. The incidents occurred at Perth shopping centres and in the homes of the victims, the court was previously told. The 57-year-old was arrested after shoppers saw him on February 14 last year taking pictures up the skirts of women in Woolworths at Karrinyup Shopping Centre. A search of his home computer later uncovered footage filmed up women's skirts at shops around Perth and video clips filmed up the skirts of women in the homes that he had attended in his role as a dishwasher repair man. Today in court, Contarinos lawyer Gavin Maclean said his client previously viewed his behaviour like a game but said his insight into his offences had changed. He now accepts that what he was doing was very wrong, Mr Maclean said. Magistrate Michael Wheeler said of Contarinos offending: Clearly there is a disturbing component to these offences. Its not easy to identify the reasons for doing this. A pre-sentence report on Contarino said he was unlikely to re-offend. Both Contarino and his lawyer refused to comment as they left court. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/pen-camera-pervert-gets-supervision-order/story-e6frg13u-1226369819059 http://www.smh.com.au/wa-news/no-prison-for-camera-pen-perve-20120528-1zen3.html http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/man-56-charged-over-up-skirt-photos-at-karrinyup-shopping-centre/story-e6frg13u-1226006239799|/images/sebastiano_contarino_2.jpg

Releasing him into an unsuspecting community to possibly molest another Australian child would be inexcusable and unfortunately current Australian laws are allowing many 1000's of child sex offenders to live secretly in Australian communities to possibly strike again-see community notification ?? While you can understand the UK not wanting him back,we have enough sex offenders here in Australia already,and unless he is locked up for good(as he should be in our humble opinion) he is a UK citizen, not an Australian and has no right to be here, except in a cell..MAKO 23-5-05 .|/images/robert_excell_1.jpg

Admitted to secretly filming more than 40 women showering in Perth hostels over a 12 month period. News (10-1-2012)- A MAN has been refused bail after admitting to secretly filming more than 40 women showering in Perth hostels, after being caught in the act yesterday. Allyn Wilson Fitzgerald, 40, pleaded guilty in Perth Magistrates Court today to 41 counts of using a surveillance device to record without knowledge. The court was told Fitzgerald recorded film clips on his iPhone of the women while hiding in nearby cubicles. The offences happened over a 12-month period at various backpackers around Perth. In court this afternoon, his duty lawyer made an application for bail on his behalf, but conceded Fitzgerald's behaviour was "abhorrent". The lawyer told the court the underlying cause for the behaviour was the post-traumatic stress disorder and depression Fitzgerald suffered after serving as a submariner in the Australian Navy for 12 years. He was arrested in November last year after one of the women caught him in the act, but was released on bail. Fitzgerald failed to appear in court last Friday for his set appearance. Detectives arrested him overnight after he was caught filming more women at another Perth hostel yesterday. A police prosecutor opposed bail, saying the community had to come first. "The number one point is the protection of the community," he said. "It is very horrific for these 41 females." Magistrate Joe Randazzo said the prospect of Fitzgerald returning to backpackers accomodation was alarming and he was concerned he may fail to appear at his next court date if granted bail. He refused bail, saying there was a likelihood that Fitzgerald would committ further offences unless he was kept in custody. "[It is] wrongdoing of such a serious nature as to make a grant of bail inappropriate," Magistrate Randazzo said. Fitzgerald has been remanded in custody and will reappear in court in March for his sentencing. A pre-sentence report and psychiatric report was ordered for the sentencing. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/shower-pervert-refused-bail/story-e6frg143-1226241129963

Prior in 2009 for importing child pornography. Jail release bid by child porn accused- (7-2-2012) A PERTH man jailed for possessing child porn for the second time in three years could be released from prison as early as today. Prasenajit Gunasekera, of Winthrop, pleaded guilty to eight counts of possessing child pornography in Perth's District Court this morning. A State prosecutor told the court Gunasekera was stopped by detectives on Great Eastern Highway, Wooroloo, on August 6, 2010. A search of his car revealed he had a mobile phone with more than 2,600 videos and images of children - the majority of which were considered child exploitation material. When police raided his Winthrop home, they uncovered memory cards, CDs, hard drives, and memory sticks filled with thousands of images of children. The prosecutor said while not all the material discovered by police constituted child pornography, a total of 7460 images and 73 videos were found that were considered to be exploitative. She told the court Gunasekera had a "signficant record" and was at high risk of reoffending, after he was jailed in January 2009 for two years for importing child pornography. The sentence related to an investigation by customs officers who stopped Gunasekera at Perth International Airport in 2007 and found child pornography on various devices in his baggage. A further search of his house uncovered a total of more than 13,500 images. Defence lawyer John Prior said Gunasekera had been in custody for 18 months as he waited for the prosecution to categorise all the images before he could be sentenced. Judge Allan Fenbury said a majority of the material found in Gunasekera's house was "fairly low-grade", though there was a significant quantity of serious material. He sentenced Gunasekera to a total of two years in prison for the eight charges, backdated to August 2010. Gunasekera is eligible for parole. If granted, he will be released immediately. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/jail-release-bid-by-child-porn-accused/story-e6frg13u-1226264861727

News (16-11-2012)- "Online Perth sex predator avoids prison" A MAN who persuaded young girls in the US and Australia to perform sexual acts via video chat websites - and then threatened to expose them to friends and family if they did not continue doing it - has escaped a jail sentence. Daniel John Leask, 22, pleaded guilty to inciting the girls, who were aged between 13 and 15, to perform various sex acts as he watched them on his laptop at his Perth home in 2010 and 2011. He also admitted blackmailing them with threats of exposure if they stopped. The first victim, who lived in the US, was just 14 when Leask befriended her online and persuaded her to remove her clothes and masturbate, while he watched on a webcam. When she eventually objected, Leask threatened to hack into her computer and reveal her behaviour. When the girl deleted Leask from her social media circle, he tracked her down through an instant messaging service, told her he had recorded their previous exchange and threatened to post the video online. He then contacted the girl's mother under an alias, and told her her daughter had been recorded performing sexual acts online. The girl's mother contacted US authorities, who tipped off the Australian Federal Police. Four more girls suffered similar persuasion and coercion, two in America, one in Victoria and one in NSW, who was the youngest victim at just 13. She was persuaded to expose herself and then threatened with exposure to her parents if she did not perform more explicit acts, which she eventually did. She told her brother, who contacted Australian authorities. In the District Court of Western Australia, Judge Kevin Sleight said the damage caused to the victims meant they had been humiliated and sexually corrupted by Leask. He rejected a suggestion Leask had made to police that he was a "white knight'' persuading teenagers not to have sex online. "You used threats to keep all of these girls involved in sexual activity on the screen,'' Judge Sleight said. He revealed that Leask had been driven to his offending after he had suffered a similar experience when he was 17. Leask was coerced by an unnamed man to perform a sexual act online, with the video published on the internet. This led to him being bullied and humiliated, causing him to suffer severe depression. Judge Sleight said he had serious concerns for Leask's welfare if he was sent to prison, given his mental health and immaturity. Leask was given a three-year good behaviour bond, ordered to perform 100 hours of community service and placed under an intense supervision order. He faces a possible three and a half years in jail if he breaches the bond or the order. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/online-perth-sex-predator-avoids-prison/story-e6frg13u-1226518233067

Pleaded guilty to 3 charges of indecent dealings with a child under 13 yrs old. Mentally ill man avoids jail for indecent dealings (6-10-2011)- A MENTALLY ill man who pinched two schoolgirls on the bottom as they played sport and lifted up another girl's skirt has avoided jail in the Perth District court today. Robinson Peter Malca-Obando, 31, of Perth, pleaded guilty to three charges of indecent dealings with a child under 13-years-old. The Perth District court was told today Malca-Obando, who was born in Peru, pinched the two schoolgirls, aged nine and 10, on the bottom as they played sport with classmates at Birdwood Square on July 23 last year. The court was told Malca-Obando was chased away from the scene by a teacher and was later apprehended by police. The court heard while Malca-Obando was on bail for this offence, he lifted up the skirt of a five-year-old girl at the Morley Galleria Shopping Centre in December last year. The court was told Malca-Obando followed the girl and her nanny in the Target store before lifting up the girls skirt to expose her underwear. The incident was captured on the shopping centres CCTV footage, the court was told. In court today, Malca-Obando avoided jail and was handed a 24-month prison sentence suspended for 24 months, on condition that he abide by program and supervision requirements. Mr Malca-Obandos lawyer Marc Saupin told Judge Christopher Stevenson his client had stopped taking his medication for his mental illness at the time of both offences. The court was told Malca-Obando had been diagnosed with having a mild case of mental retardation and bipolar defective disorder. Mr Saupin conceded the offences committed by his client were every parents worst nightmare but that he had shown a remarkable improvement in the past six to eight weeks. He said if Malca-Obando were sent to prison, it would undo those improvements. He has offended in the most heinous of ways, Mr Saupin said. Hed come out of prison and be left to his own devices (if he were jailed). Judge Stevenson described Malca-Obandos offending as predatory which would have caused extreme concern to the parents of the victims, the teachers who witnessed the Highgate incident and the five-year-old girls nanny. The offending was predatory and opportunisticwhich the community will not tolerate, Judge Stevenson said. The consequences of your behaviour have far reaching effects beyond the victims themselves. Judge Stevenson noted Malca-Obando had had a difficult childhood and that his mild mental illness had affected his ability to integrate properly in the community. But all of these things Mr Malca-Obando are no excuses to commit offences of this type, he said. Judge Stevenson noted Malca-Obando had already spent several months in custody and that he had a strong family support network who wished to help him in the future. In handing down the 24-month suspended prison term, Judge Stevenson urged Malca-Obando to abide by any supervision and program requirements in the near future and to begin re-taking his medication. It remains the fact that if you fail to take your medicationyou will commit these type of offences, he said. Mr Saupin told the court his client was willing to take his medication via a monthly injection that could be administered at his home. http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/mentally-ill-man-avoids-jail-for-indecent-dealings/story-e6frg153-1226160464337

O'Meara was the chaplain of the elite Anglican girl's college, "Mount Lawley's Perth College", after relocating from Melbourne in January 2010. "Former Perth College chaplain Matthew David O'Meara jailed for 15 months" (21-3-2013) A former Perth College chaplain has been sentenced to 15 months imprisonment after being found guilty of possessing child pornography. A District Court jury found Matthew David OMeara guilty on Monday, following his three week trial over four counts of possessing child pornography after USBs were found containing photos and videos of young girls on them at Perth College in August 2010. In sentencing, Judge Ronald Birmingham said O'Meara's offending "struck at the very heart of the trust" imposed on him by Perth College when they employed him as head chaplain at the all-girls school. "They were entitled to expect more from you," he said. Almost 450 images were found in O'Meara's possession on the two thumb drives and deleted from his home computer, including images and movies of young girls performing sexual acts. Judge Birmingham said the evidence left no doubt O'Meara "had a tendency or a sexual interest in young girls." He said O'Meara had hid behind a mask to friends and family and insistence that others were responsible for the images on the thumb drives showed he had "no remorse." "That you fall from such a height is largely the result of a self-inflicted wound," he said. Despite the guilty verdict, O'Meara maintains his innocence and outside court his lawyers said he would be considering an appeal against the conviction. Defence counsel Laurie Levy told Judge Birmingham during his submissions that in the two years and seven months since his client was charged, O'Meara had become "professionally and financially ruined." He also said O'Meara's job prospects were non-existent because for more than 14 years he had worked as a teacher and a chaplain. Th Anglican Church has revoked his pastoral licence. This evening his wife Karina, parents and sister expressed their ongoing support for him. "We all believe that he has suffered a terrible injustice, a brutal injustice and we have to do what we can to regroup," Mrs O'Meara told reporters outside court. O'Meara was sentenced to six months imprisonment for counts one and four and nine months for counts two and three. However Judge Birmingham said count two was to be the head sentence, with counts one and three to be served concurrently and count four to be served accumulative, totalling 15 months. O'Meara will be eligible for parole after seven and a half months. http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/former-perth-college-chaplain-matthew-david-omeara-found-guilty-of-child-porn-possession/story-e6frfkp9-1226602868355 http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/former-perth-college-chaplain-matthew-david-omeara-found-guilty-of-child-porn-possession/story-e6frg13u-1226600115691 http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/reverend-feared-retribution-before-child-porn-discovery-20121008-279ib.html|/images/matthew_david_o'meara.jpg

Victim was a girl abused from the age of 8 yrs. News (20-8-2010)- "Long jail term for abuser"- FORMER Esperance resident Mark Thomas OSullivan has been sentenced at the Perth District Court to eight and a half years in jail in relation to 26 child abuse offences. Mr OSullivan, 46, was jailed after a five-day trial in Perth last week. Judge Stavrianou said the offending was repeated over nine years, commencing when the girl was eight years of age. You have shown no remorse for your offending and continue to deny the commission of the offences, His Honour said. The complainant was exposed to a wide variety of adult sexual behaviour. As Ive said, the need for general and specific deterrence in this type of offending is significant. As Ive said also, you are not penalised in this sentencing process by the fact that youve pleaded not guilty to the charges. Esperance Police Detective Sergeant Doug Backhouse, who was in charge of the investigation, said that sexual offences against children would have to be the most abhorrent crime imaginable. I just cannot get my head around the fact that people can commit such despicable acts on innocent and vulnerable children for their own sexual gratification, and in the process destroy the young persons childhood and often affect them for the rest of their lives, he said. This office has been responsible for the conviction of a number of child sex offenders over the last several years and they all received lengthy jaill terms, justifiably so, he said. Mr OSullivan will be eligible for consideration for release by the Prisoners Review Board after six and a half years in jail. http://www.esperanceexpress.com.au/news/local/news/general/long-jail-term-for-abuser/1917881.aspx|/images/mark_thomas_osullivan.jpg

"You have no respect for the invasion of someone's personal rights and sexual integrity, and you have no respect for the invasion of someone's dwelling in which they're staying," he said. "Put simply, you're a danger to society." Details of Pool's crimes recounted in court included cutting a girl's clothes off her body and filming himself molesting her, filming a girl naked in the shower, and taking advantage of children he was babysitting. "They were in your care for the evening, and one can expect you to have taken care of them and not to have offended in this way," Judge Goetze said. However, he said Pool had shown genuine remorse by pleading guilty. In a letter, Pool wrote: "No one deserves to be treated that way. I shocked myself and did not offend again. Four months later I was arrested." Noting the victim impact statements, Judge Goetze said some of the victims had severe issues with trust, were still living in fear, felt they were being watched, and needed counselling. He said one victim even thought she was going to die during Pool's attack on her and another victim no longer felt comfortable in her own home. Judge Goetze said Pool had shown a "significant diversity of sexual offending" and was a high risk of re-offending. He will be eligible to be considered for parole after serving nine years and nine months in prison. His sentence was backdated to January 31. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/violent-sex-offender-jailed-for-11-years/story-e6freono-1226516847523

News (4-8-2009)- "Cold case repeat rapist jailed for 10 years"- A PERTH man who returned to rape a young mother on a second occasion in her own home has been sentenced to 10 years jail. Lawrence Quartermaine, 28, was charged after police held a cold case review of the rapes, which occurred in 2003. Quartermaine broke into the woman's home in Maddington and sexually assaulted her while her eight-year-old daughter slept beside her. He returned three weeks later and committed the same offences. Quartermaine originally pleaded not guilty to the offences, but changed his pleas after his victim testified in court. Today, District Court judge Richard Keen described the crimes as "every woman's worst nightmare", and said Quartermaine had shown no remorse for his crimes.

Pleaded guilty to 1 count of deprivation of liberty- 3 counts of aggravated indecent assault-1 count of aggravated sexual penetration without consent. Also sentenced for stalking a woman between November 2008 and April 2009 and some driving offences/ breaching suspended sentence. News (6-4-2011)- A young father who was filmed stalking a 14-year-old girl on a Perth train before he dragged her into secluded bush in Greenwood and molested her has been jailed. Neil Martin Sachman was yesterday sentenced to six years and one month jail for the July 25 attack on the teenager, for stalking offences committed against a Busselton woman over several months in late 2008 and 2009 and for traffic matters. Security camera footage shows how Sachman stalked the girl, who had been shopping south of Perth, after he boarded a train at Bull Creek. Sachman was filmed following the teenager when she left the train at Greenwood station. The West Australian understands footage from a security camera at a Greenwood home shows how Sachman was so fixated on the girl that he was almost hit by a car he failed to notice as he was following her. The District Court was told he asked the girl for the time before putting his hand over her mouth and dragging her into secluded bushes south of the train station. He forced the girl to kiss him, fondled her breasts and sexually penetrated her before masturbating over her legs. "It was a frightening and demeaning experience for the young victim, who no longer feels able to travel on public transport by herself," Chief Judge Peter Martino said. "She's had difficulties with education and friendships. She has ongoing anxiety, anger and depression." Sachman was on bail for stalking offences in Busselton when he molested the girl. The court was told how Sachman made sexually explicit and threatening phone calls to a woman once described as a friend who owed him $200. "Your conduct caused considerable distress and anxiety to the victim, and has also had a long-standing impact upon her, causing anxiety and loss of confidence and restriction in her social and work activities," Chief Judge Martino said of the stalking matter. Sachman was also sentenced over a crash on South Street, Kardinya, when he was driving without a valid licence. Chief Judge Martino accepted that Sachman's guilty pleas showed a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. Sachman will be subject to lifetime restraining orders over his two victims. He will be eligible for parole after serving four years and one month of his sentence, backdated to July 25 last year when he was taken into custody. http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/9142718/child-molester-jailed-for-six-years/|/images/neil_sachman_2.jpg

DARREN HARLEY WEST (WA- Aboriginal community at Warburton)|47 yrs old (2013)|Jailed indefinitely in WA, Feb - 2013.|Darren Harley West- Child Sex Offences-Repeat Offender. Judge jails WA sex offender indefinitely (23-1-2013) A court has ruled a convicted pedophile with a near 20-year history of sexually abusing teenagers remain in prison indefinitely because he still poses a serious risk to the community. Darren Harley West, 47, was first convicted of having sex with a girl aged under 16 in 1996. He was convicted of the same offence with another girl in 2006. After being found guilty of a similar offence against a 13-year-old boy in 2007, West was sent to prison for six years, with a release date of October 2012. Western Australia's Director of Public Prosecutions objected to West's release under the state's Dangerous Sexual Offenders Act, and on Wednesday Justice Michael Corboy agreed he still needed to be locked up after two psychiatrists ruled him a serious risk of reoffending. "In my view, the community can only be adequately protected, at this time, by a continuing detention," Justice Corboy said. West's family had supported his release to the Aboriginal community at Warburton. But Justice Corboy ruled West's history of offending and the likelihood he would be in close proximity to adolescents if he was released was too big a concern. "The reality is that in a small community, such as Warburton, Mr West would always be in close proximity to young adolescents," Justice Corboy said. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/judge-jails-wa-sex-offender-indefinitely/story-e6freuz0-1226560245254
MARK BRADLEY WIMBRIDGE (WA)|45 yrs old (2012)|Currently March 2011 is jailed indefinitely - detention to be reviewed annually.|Mark Bradley Wimbridge- Rapist/ Repeat Offender. Chemical castration fails to cure rapist- (17-3-2011) A dangerous repeat rapist, who was released on supervision last year, has been sent back to jail after the Supreme Court was told he breached his release conditions, had psychopathic tendencies and that chemical castration had failed. Mark Bradley Wimbridge, 44, whose long criminal history includes a brutal sex attack on a woman when he was 18 and the repeated rape of a prostitute, was released last July with conditions that he have treatment and stay away from sex workers and areas of "erotic activity". At the time, Justice Peter Blaxell noted Wimbridge was taking part in a trial of an anti-libidinal drug and had taken responsibility for his offending. But yesterday, the same court was told that the drug, aimed at reducing the rapist's sex drive, was not working. His testosterone level had lowered, but there was no associated reduction in libido, the court was told. Wimbridge was in court because he breached the release conditions which banned him from drinking alcohol, entering the suburbs of Northbridge and Highgate and going to sex shops and places of "erotic activity". The court was told Wimbridge had been caught drink-driving twice, was found with an undisclosed Internet-capable mobile, had viewed hardcore pornography, was arranging to meet a prostitute, and had covertly filmed a woman at a bus stop. Psychiatrist Peter Wynn Owen told the court that, in his opinion, the chemical castration had failed and there were no practicable methods to supervise Wimbridge in the community. Dr Wynn Owen said it appeared Wimbridge had psychopathic tendencies and could not be trusted to honestly self-report to authorities as part of his release. Justice John McKechnie said Wimbridge's breaches were very serious and that he presented a risk to the community. Wimbridge was jailed indefinitely and his detention will now be reviewed annually. http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/wa/9023465/chemical-castration-fails-to-cure-rapist/ http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/7613896/judge-orders-rapist-s-release/
